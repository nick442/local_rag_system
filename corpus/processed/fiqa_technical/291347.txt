When I walk into a Sears or K-Mart, I feel like I am stepping back 30 years. Some of their stores are downright neglected. If they want to compete, they have to remodel their physical stores, remodel their sales tactics, and probably change names. None of which anyone is going to loan them any money to do, at this point. Short stock, anyone?
