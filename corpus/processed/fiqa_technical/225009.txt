"> Don't forget: Praise in public, criticize in private. I would also add to reinforce your praise in private as well, but not when you're about to criticize. During a one-on-one (which OP should hold monthly with each employee), remind them of the awesome thing(s) you remember them doing since the last meeting (but don't make something up or make something small seem big). It shows that you care enough to remember, even when others have ""left the room""."
