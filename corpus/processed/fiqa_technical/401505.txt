> You'll probably find that the majority of tech startups are looking for under $100k to get going. Check out kickstarter.com sometime. Not from employees. By the time you're ready to hire, you should be past the point where $100k in sweat equity dribbled out over a four-year vesting period is worth bothering with another shareholder. Those kind of arrangements are normally reserved for founders. People on kickstartr are looking for cash, not cheap labor. Founders usually lack the former and have plenty of their own time to supply the latter.
