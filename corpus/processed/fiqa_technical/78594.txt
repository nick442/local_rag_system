Credit cards also take a cut. Canada's interac system (use your bank card at the POS to instantly transfer money from your bank to the store) costs merchants 15 cents per transaction. Visa and Mastercard charge about 3% per transaction. They justify this by saying that cards encourage people to spend more and stores can make bigger sales. With cash, I am limited to what's in my pocket, but with visa or interac, if something is just a little more expensive than I'd planned on spending, it's no big deal, I just swipe the card, type my pin and have the product. If the option is between a sale -x%, or no sale at all, the former beats the latter. Square is offering a service that is convenient as hell, and they make it very easy to set up and use. Convenience and ease of use are something that people are willing to pay for.
