"I agree with you that this is the ""human"" reaction, but supposedly the people running these companies are supposed to be amazing businessmen, hence the reason they're making beaucoup bucks on top of billion dollar businesses. I've run smaller, yet still million dollar businesses before, and while there have been tough times where we've had to take damage control measures before, we sure didn't do that while completely ignoring the cause of the problem, nor the future as it was likely to be. To do otherwise is simply myopic, as the music industry is finally beginning to find out."
