"Yes, in your laughably reductionist view, the average scores of black people are lower than the average scores of white people (which are lower than East Asians and Indians), so in your view that would make them stupider, on average. But that's a very misleading and superficial conclusion to draw from everything I've just covered. You have no sources for your baseless criticism of the IQ metric, you have no understanding of the relative variance between heritable intelligence and individuals, and you have no understanding of how genetics works. You're clueless, and your attempts to make a data-driven science into ""wah wah I interpret this as WAYCISST"" is truly funny as fuck. Thanks for the luls!"
