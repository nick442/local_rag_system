I am guessing that you don't understand that even a 100% tax bracket doesn't actually equal you paying 100% of your profits in taxes. This is why the use, while having a 35%messaging corporate tax rate, only sees less than 20% in an average effective corporate tax rate.. In the same vein, if a company paid taxes on what profits were created within a countries borders, that would be a fairly accurate method of calculating every country's fair percent of revenue from that company and the amount of infrastructure that were utilized by that company within that country's borders. And it still wouldn't add up to anywhere near 100% of that company's net profits..
