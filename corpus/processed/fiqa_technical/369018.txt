But adapting to shopping online, doesn't answer all of the other areas impacted by this transition. Logistical changes, manufacturing changes, local jobs whether minimum wage or not, potential regulations being put in place, and there are already clauses that retailers are adding into their store policies for purchases on bulk items permitting Amazon resale. I'm not sure how gradual it will be once the listed stores closing, officially close. Certain areas are impacted differently depending upon alternative consumer options available. If companies like Comcast are suing over having to take action to assure service for an area where they are a service provider, I imagine Amazon is having some issue with supply and demand and meeting deliveries in remote areas.
