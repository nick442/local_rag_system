Matt Levine at Bloomberg published [a great summary and piece of commentary on the allegations](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2015-12-17/martin-shkreli-accused-of-being-surprisingly-good-at-fraud) when Shkreli was first indicted. The short version is that Shkreli lost all of his hedge fund investors' money while telling them things were going great, founded the pharmaceutical company Retrophin, took it public, then looted it to pay back his original investors.
