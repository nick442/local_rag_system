Are you worried at all about the $5 trillion in bonds held by the FED? It seems some of the Keynesian crowd on here isn't concerned at all or or at least pretending to have no concerns. Is there any precedent for a country canceling that amount of debt ever and kept reserve currency status? I was just watching a documentary about WWI and Keynes said at the outset the war would have to stop after a few months because each side would run out of money. Kitchener said baloney, a war in progress would never stop and they would go into debt. Kitchener was right and the world descended into an apocalypse it's still working through. I wonder if any of the political leaders then made decisions based on his opinions. He was dead wrong about the most important event in Europe's history and maybe the world.
