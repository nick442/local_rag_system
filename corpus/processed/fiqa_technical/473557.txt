seriously money is debt has to be the most ridiculous comparison i've ever heard. that statement implies commutativity and certainly i would never say debt is money. i could take on debt to get money, but the debt itself is a liability and not an asset. your last paragraph about fiat money is correct, but i should say that with modern financial markets price discovery isn't some magic voodoo thing.
