>The interesting thing for me - In Ireland's case they need to have a refurendum. I wonder if they will accept this? It's not clear cut whether we need a referendum. It's a common misconception that all Treaty changes require a referendum in Ireland. Not so. In Crotty v An Taoiseach it was accepted by the Supreme Court that joining the EEC (as it then was) involved getting on board a moving train and that even the assignment of new competences to Europe would not necessarily necessitate a referendum. Any change in the fundamental scope of the Union would however require a referendum. In that case the introduction of a Common Foreign and Security Policy and qualified majority voting was a change in scope and referendum was necessary. In this case, it's hard to tell. The EU already has some competence in this area - its possible to levy fines etc for breaches of the stability and growth pact already. I couldn't predict how the Supreme Court would characterise giving the Court of Justice oversight in this area. They will feel presssure from many corners in this case as well - holding in favour of a referendum might be seen as threatening economic disaster, while holding against would undermine democratic legitimacy. If there is a referendum, I predict it will go down like a lead balloon. Forcing the Lisbon Treaty on the electorate twice gave rise to enough resentment - botching the recovery and being seen to enforce austerity on the country made it worse. I imagine support for the EU is at an all time low in this country.
