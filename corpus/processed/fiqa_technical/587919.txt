I was a math undergrad and transitioned into a career in finance that isn't quant. I also just sat for CFA Level I and you're right - it's basically what you would learn as a finance/Econ undergrad. I found my math degree to be a really good differentiating factor when applying for jobs amongst a sea of business majors.
