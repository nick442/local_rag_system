The way bitcoin works it has no choice to go up. It's high risk because If say America bans it, its almost worthless, or your investment at least. It's a worldwide currency, though the dollar talks. the cost of the coin has to be higher than the cost to mine + sell. And every 4 years you mine 1/2 of the last, and the more who start up miners mean you use the same power to earn less.
