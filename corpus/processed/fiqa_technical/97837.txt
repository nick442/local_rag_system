What the fuck are you talking about? They amended their S-1 filing with the SEC. The revenue outlook was a matter of public record. It's not their fault that no one actually reads the filings. The purpose of the filings is to make such information public. It's the fault of stupid investors and incompetent analysts and journalists for not reading the fucking disclosure documents. Do you really expect them to go out of their way to announce negative data? Because that's crazy. They will do the bare minimum required by law. Smart people that read the disclosure documents then discuss this info. Dumb money just buys the hype. This was not a disclosure failure. All the info was there to be used.
