According to many sources **[Shopify](https://shopify.com/?ref=spurit)** is one of the most popular platform to start your business. If you have never tried something similar, then I personally recommend you to try as they have 14 days trial period. What I personally like in Shopify is the ability to add new apps for functionality increase. For instance, in case you are looking for pre-order function and you don't want to be involved in some techy things, then you can simply install this: * **[Pre-Order Manager](https://apps.shopify.com/pre-order/?ref=spurit)**. A preorder button with a beautiful title will show up on the out of stock product page and you will be able to easily control preorders. That's one of the examples about how it's easy to add something new to your Shopify Store. Also there are tons of themes available which allows you to customize your Store and make it unique. Of course there are some limitations in Shopify, but it's not a big problem and can be solved in many cases.
