With overdraft fees, I feel it is no different than a loan shark. They charge 35$ fee no matter if you buy a 25 cent pack of gum or something much more expensive. Every time you over drafted you payed 35$. My wife has seen some people with 500 or more in fees because they spent 100 bucks or so over several transactions.
