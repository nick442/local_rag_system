"Yes, we're on the same page. But what if incremental improvements in materials, actuators, etc give us a 3D printer with diamond-scribe cutters that *can* machine a block of metal? Cooling will be a problem, but consumers are building liquid-cooled computers and even oil-bath computers and LN2-cooled systems. A few breakthroughs, and then it's just about commoditizing the machinery. Pricing may never get to ""Let's get one for Timmy for his birthday"" level, but a $75,000 investment isn't unheard of for a small shop. The next tipping point would be carbon-fiber and nanomaterials. Maybe we'll figure out how to lay down strands of carbon tubes in a commercial environment. Then a 3D printer builds up the part instead of cutting it out of a block. Or consider a new resin that could be injection-molded into a dynamic mold. We only recently discovered aerogels and green/white technology - not a stretch to consider Bakelite+ that would be strong enough to hold a stator for an industrial motor. SF authors of the 50s should've known better about flying cars. These were smart men, and if they had simply considered the issues of energy density vs. lifting a metric ton of metal they quickly would've seen that they are simply impractical thanks to the laws of physics. And us not living on the moon isn't an issue of technology. We just stopped going."
