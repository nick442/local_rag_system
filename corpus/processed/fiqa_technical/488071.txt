Logistics. There's no way our current system can keep up with the expected of growth of online sales . At some point you'll need a local warehouse to door network or an Uber like system that can move from major shipping points to the consumer directly. It'd be like an on call warehouse direct to consumer eco system without the need for massive sorting centers like the one that UPS has in Louisville KY. Amazon has it with Amazon Now but that's proprietary if someone were to create an independent entity it would be Gold.
