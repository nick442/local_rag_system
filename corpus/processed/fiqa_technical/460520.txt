If the implication is that she destroyed Yahoo, I have written in this piece that she has saved Yahoo from the inevitable painful death. Search and online advertisement business is a monopolistic business dominated by google (https://goo.gl/MTEvFp). Yahoo never had a real chance in the market to survive on its own. Marissa did an excellent job at Yahoo to stabilize the business and shift it away from Jerry Yang's misguided investments and bets (https://goo.gl/ufmYsw). I am certain that Marissa will make a great CEO for Uber, and help Uber survive the current severe head-winds the company is facing.
