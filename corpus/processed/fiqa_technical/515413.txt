Actually he probably saved a lot of jobs at citi. He took over right about the time Lehman bros declared bankruptcy. Every big investment bank was about collapse. The headline is very misleading. The damage was already done when he took over. I don't support CEO pay like this in any situation, but dont blame him for running citi into the ground.
