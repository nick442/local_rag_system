Higher business tax rates, incentivises businesses to spend to avoid taxes. spending is always either on more employees, or buying things that supports more employees in other companies. Its easily possible (links provided elsewhere in thread) to have higher tax rates without incentivizing the moving of HQs for tax arbitrage. Globalized production is motivated much more by labour costs than it is by tax rates, but its also easy to use higher tax rates to encourage local spending. Economists don't lobby politicians. Only liars need to do that.
