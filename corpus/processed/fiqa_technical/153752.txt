I seriously doubt that healthy attitudes are catching on on a scale that McDonald's would notice. Rather, I expect the fact that [people eat out more](http://rapidcityjournal.com/news/eating-out-more-popular-as-home-dinner-costs-rise/article_d566dd4d-1445-552a-9137-457a956b6916.html) and the profusion of fast food alternatives that come with that increase in demand are just making plain ol' McDonald's look unappetizing. I'm sure that their reputation as unhealthy isn't helping, but I don't expect that the actual diets people are eating are any better for them overall.
