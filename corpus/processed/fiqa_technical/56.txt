You can never use a health FSA for individual health insurance premiums. Moreover, FSA plan sponsors can limit what they are will to reimburse. While you can't use a health FSA for premiums, you could previously use a 125 cafeteria plan to pay premiums, but it had to be a separate election from the health FSA. However, under N. 2013-54, even using a cafeteria plan to pay for indivdiual premiums is effectively prohibited.
