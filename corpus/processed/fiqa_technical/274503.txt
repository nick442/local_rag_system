Hi all, I have a modelling test coming up for a FT analyst position, and I'm told it will be an hour. I'm not too sure what to expect, I've done full-blown 3-statement LBOs which I don't think I'm able to finish in one hour and I've also done short-form LBOs where I just built out the income statement and cash flow statement and exit analysis. Problem is, I've never sat for a one-hour test and I'm not too sure what to expect. Can someone provide some insight please? Thank you very much!
