I work next door to their office in Little Rock and you're right, that's not a lot of profit on the sales they make. Acxiom is notorious in Arkansas for going on layoff binges every couple of years where at least 1/4 to 1/3 of their workforce is let go. It has a lot to do with their razor thin margins. That said, my company is currently using some of their data for market analysis and it's pretty good stuff.
