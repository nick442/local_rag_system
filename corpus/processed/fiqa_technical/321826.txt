Not sure why USPS wouldn't put the screws to stamps.com. Stamps might be sending a lot of customers to USPS but Stamps has a major flaw in their business model by having only one supplier for their key product (stamps). If I were USPS I would leverage that fact to take a high share of Stamp's revenue.
