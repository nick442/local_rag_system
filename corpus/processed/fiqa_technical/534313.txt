Ya maybe - I mean, what they did was incredibly wrong and immoral but I don't believe it was illegal so I doubt it's a realistic premise. What is realistic however, is a timberwolves team that upsets the playoffs all the way to conference finals. After a year in Cleveland, can you picture a scenario where Rose takes a vet min, maybe a 2 year stint working with the young guys. Wolves bench leaves much to be desired so I'm sure that will be FO thibs next focal point, I just think it would be nice.
