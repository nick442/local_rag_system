>I would be all for that as soon as every job in society pays people enough for a modest life including insurance. Before that happens, this approach is just setting the lower classes up for failure. You mean, like how the lower classes all over the world - billions of people - have been lifted out of poverty by countries adopting economic liberalizations and rollback of government intervention? >I know this is a fundamental ideal of the right but I do not share it. I think you need a lot of carrots to get people to change. Not my problem. If people want to be irresponsible, that's their right. They DO NOT have the right to have the government steal some of my money because they didn't plan properly. >Is it moral for a rich man who made all his money while using public infrastructure and services to claim all his profits are exclusively his? 100% absolutely. That infrastructure is already paid for. His success creates no additional burden or obligation. >You do understand that if/when we get a terrific healthcare system that benefits the common man the healthcare stocks would tank? No, they wouldn't. In fact, the healthcare market would grow so rapidly it would be the investing opportunity of a lifetime. Thousands of new companies formed. A massive wave of innovation in products and services when the FDA is curtailed. It would be absolutely crazy.
