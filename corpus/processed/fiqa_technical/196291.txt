MZM (or Money Zero Maturity) refers to the total amount of money that is immediately redeemable at par value on demand. It includes coins and currency in circulation, checking and saving accounts, and money market funds. Thus, MZM includes all financial instruments that can be freely accessed immediately without penalty or risks. The chart, as described by the above paragraph, excludes treasuries/federal debt, 401ks/IRAs, foreign investment, home loans, student loans, bonds and the stock market. Boomers are drawing down their savings accounts while most of GenX/millennials income is beholden to some form of debt for at least a decade or more. The chart is a vivid illustration of why the middle class is being hollowed out and why headline inflation has not manifested yet.
