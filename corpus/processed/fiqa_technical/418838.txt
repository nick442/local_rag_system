Former investment banker here. I joined an M&A group and then decided not to do PE, but that was what most peers did. 1) When in school, get the top grades. They want to see that you barely make mistakes. You're going to be dealing with other people's money, so very little room for error. 2) join the student finance organizations. If you can't join em, then create one. If that's too much, then go to their meetings and sit in. Do something. Get out there and don't take no for an answer. 3) do something on the side that shows your genuine interest. Start investing your own money. Come up with an investment thesis. This is going to show them you actually care about what you want to do and you're not all talk. 4) network. Network. Network. Friends of family. Family of friends. Strangers. You don't know who can help you, so know everyone. If you show that you are eager and willing to learn, people will bend over backwards to help you. Just remain humble. Don't be a snarky dick. Stay focused. Stay determined. If something doesn't go your way, it's not the end. No road isn't always straight and paved. You might have to go on a winding gravel road to get to where you want to go, but if you want to get there bad enough, you'll make it. And maybe along the way, you might realize that it's not something you want to do, so you'll pivot. Nothing wrong with that. Do what you want, not what you think other people think you should do. Good luck!
