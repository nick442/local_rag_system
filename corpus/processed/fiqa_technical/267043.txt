Politics aside, you also have to factor in working conditions and the fact that those folks are actually NEEDED in a lot of cases. Automated toll booths aren't free, and they need to be maintained. If you aren't paying someone a living wage they're going to find something else. I don't see the problem with compensating someone based partially on years of service and hazard pay (ie freezing cold or intense heat)
