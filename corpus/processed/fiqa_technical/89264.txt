I like this plan. A [law](http://www.forbes.com/sites/aroy/2012/05/27/why-do-hospitals-charge-4423-for-250-ct-scans-blame-arizona-republicans/) that would take Arizona hospitals in this direction was [shelved](http://www.forbes.com/sites/aroy/2012/05/27/why-do-hospitals-charge-4423-for-250-ct-scans-blame-arizona-republicans/) earlier this year. For all the lip service paid to a transparent and functioning free market, it looks like there is not much political will to push in that direction from either side of the aisle, unfortunately. I think that the Republican's best play would be to push this kind of legislation through in a couple of places, let the market work its magic and then point to it as a model. I don't know why they don't. There is nothing stopping it from coexisting with Obamacare. But instead they'd rather sit on their hands and complain and promise how much better things would be without doing anything to prove it. Sigh.
