"She pissed off a customer service person, and that person obviously called over and had her good reviews ""filtered"". I'm betting she's not an easy person to get along with, and Yelp doesn't necessarily HAVE to give you good reviews - they just have to ""promote"" you. I'm not a business owner, so I will honestly admit I don't know the details of the service you are guaranteed to receive when you pay Yelp."
