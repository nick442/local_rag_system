Ownership of the debt is irrelevant if Puerto Rico tells the investors to kick rocks. Which it already has. Puerto Rico created the debt by accepting the loans it couldn't pay and under terms that caused full repayment in the event of one default. Which, spoiler alert, happens when you accrue $70bn in debt, with $50bn in unsecured pension liabilities created by bloated government pensions. They also gave the middle finger to the investors whose money they happily took when things were good, only to flush it down the toilet and cry foul after they ran out of free money. The teacher's union and police officers unions opted out of SS so that they could reap these pension benefits. The reality is that Puerto Rico buried itself in social programs that never really got an economy, that never had much going on, to experience any growth. It doesn't matter who owns the debt, this guy (from the article) sees a potential payday if the US swoops in and saves them from their crisis. https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/03/08/business/dealbook/puerto-rico-teacher-pensions.html
