"You're not right about anything. Not a thing. First of all, your spelling and grammar sucks. You sound like you are completely stoned out of your mind with every word you write. >it could be night for me, other part of the globe u know. You have made a number of statements showing that you live in the U.S. Sorry that won't work. You suggested I am more likely to make assumptions then linked to an article showing that smarter people are more likely to have confirmation bias. Thank you for the compliment. Your argument about M2 is a poor argument. You keep saying increasing the money supply is good for the economy. Where do you think inflation comes from? Every country that tried printing massive amounts of money suffered serious consequences from it later. See the Roman Empire, Banana Republic, Byzantine, post World War I Germany which led to the rise of Adolf Hitler etc. Your argument that printing money and giving it graduates is deflationary also defies all logic. >see, im still smarter than you are. You haven't proven that by any objective measure. >i know wut's going on, while you don't and instead argue with emotion and arrogance and willful ignorance and name calling. You meant you know ""what's"" going on? In the future it might be better to break your sentences up a little. You crammed three (very poorly written) sentences into one. You should also take a grade school grammar class on the overuse of conjunctions such as ""and."" You used it four times in that sentence which dilutes its effectiveness. I'd ask you to elaborate but I am not interested in listening to one more of your nonsensical theses. There is also no emotion in anything I've written. Just annoyance. No willful ignorance. Just an informed, unbiased position based solely off of facts. I strongly encourage you to do the same some day."
