Thanks for your reply. I understand what all of the functions are, however, what I want to know is what I will be doing in Layman's terms. I guess I would just like to know what a day-in-the-life of what I would be doing will be. I would also like to know what I should expect during the phone interview I am having on Monday. Thanks for your help on the matter
