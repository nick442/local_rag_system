I just went through this process and found protolabs, they did end up quite expensive once the tooling came in this was injection moulding. I was looking for 400 a year but would only make sense at 10000 per year. I ended up finding a company that does plastic forming custom design technology that were good on price and the quality was great. PM me if you want details, or just Google them, I'm not your supervisor.
