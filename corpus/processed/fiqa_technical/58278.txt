Most of the Walmart hate can be traced back to Unions who have been trying to get in for years, this is not about the employees. I see no evidence that Walmart has less pay/benefits than a comparable job at any other store. Also the other big box stores are not unionized either, but Walmart is the biggest so they go after them.
