As a rule of thumb, no. Only in very rare circumstances will it prove better than a RRSP. The media has overplayed the usefulness of this account type for retirement savings. That's just a general rule. Your specific situation will make a difference but it's very easy to show that RRSPs will always outperform if the marginal rates are lower on withdrawal than when you deduct contributions from income. If you plan to use the money before retirement or you're expecting to collect GIS on retirement then you may need to look at the specifics of your situation. If you plan to put money in a RRSP and carry forward the deduction to use at a later date then it doesn't matter whether you put it in a RRSP now or use the TFSA and transfer it later. The RRSP also has advantages of some tax treaties and creditor protection. It (as a RRIF) can also be used after 65 for income splitting and the pension credit. An RESP can also provide a greater return as you get free money, which is always good. There are many other things you can do with it but I'd say it's always better in a TFSA than paying tax in a regular account. Since you pay the mortgage with after tax dollars that could be another option for the cash and it's a guaranteed return, albeit small nowadays.
