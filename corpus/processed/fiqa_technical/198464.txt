I shorted at 1.35 recently, I was short from 1.39 and closed at 1.33 There are two collapse scenarios scenarios: 1. Euro collapse all countries revert (very unlikely) eur/usd = 0 2. Euro zone kicks out the PIIGS, eurusd =1.5, the currency now has only the strong countries in it which will reduce all of the eurozone risk. Scenario two will kill you if you are short. Short the currency and leverage it up (in fx you can usually get 50:1 leverage).
