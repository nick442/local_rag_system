"The various levels of government have laws determining what a protected class is. Federally, [these](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protected_class) are the protected classes under federal law. It is illegal to discriminate against someone based on their membership of any of those demographics. On the state and local level, many states have additional protections. For example, my home state of IL explicitly forbids discrimination based on someone's sexual orientation or gender identity, classes which are not explicitly forbidden on the federal level. Hate speech is protected under the First Amendment, so long as you're not inciting violence. (That caveat is very murky and I am not qualified enough to speak on what is and isn't inciting violence from a legal perspective, I just know that the caveat exists) The key distinction that I think a lot of people misunderstand and are confused about is that, while hate speech is protected under the first amendment like all other forms of speech, it is not a protected class. Meaning, I can say whatever hateful rhetoric I want, but non government entities are free to discriminate against me. I can absolutely be fired if my employer finds out I am posting on Facebook advocating for the death of black lives matter activists, or saying stuff like ""terrorist immigrant rapists go home"" because political speech is not a protected class. I cannot be fired for posting a photo of my gay wedding (in IL), because in IL sexual orientation is a protected class. Does that make sense?"
