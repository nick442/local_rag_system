But the problem I have with that is when times change, business models should too. Companies can't cling to past plans when the market changes and expect to keep making money. Successful companies constantly adapt and change. Corporations shouldn't be suing their customers when their products are failing. They should be figuring out what has changed about the market and adapting their products to entice customers to buy again.
