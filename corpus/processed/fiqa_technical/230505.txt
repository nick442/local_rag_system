"Correct, but then you have to think of all the people that have to buy new transmissions, new engines, new suspension, etc. Production of those also require manufacturing. I'm not saying holding on too a car is bad, but it's not a black and white ""running a car until it disintegrates is better"" situation. And why not get a Tesla and then run THAT into the ground? You don't have to buy it right away, but your next car could be a Tesla or other electric vehicle."
