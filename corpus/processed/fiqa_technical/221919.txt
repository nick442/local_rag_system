"Saying this to addicts makes you an asshole because this is patronizing as hell, which was already mentioned. If the solution were as simple as ""smoke weed instead of taking pills"", don't you think addicts would already be doing that? The fact that you don't understand why this is patronizing and unhelpful is why you shouldn't be speaking on the subject."
