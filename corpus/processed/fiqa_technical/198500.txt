>This is only partly true, and it's slightly misleading. It's absolutely 100% true, and not misleading at all. Legal tender laws don't make anyone accept any particular value for money, they just mean that you have to accept that money as payment. IOW, everyone is perfectly free to instantaneously decide that a dollar is worth only 1/1,000,000,000th of an orange, and oranges would instantly cost a billion dollars. Oranges cost less than that not because the government sets the price of oranges, but purely because that's what the market agrees to. I'm explaining internal combustion for a 5-year-old, and you're calling it inaccurate and misleading because it doesn't address the sociological implications of American car-culture.
