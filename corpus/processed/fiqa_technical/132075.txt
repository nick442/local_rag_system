The fact that the government is picking and choosing who becomes a domestic shipping monopoly and defending them afterwards with lower shipping rates is in itself the problem, not who it chooses. And you're right. Amazon is hardly alone in recieving this benefit. http://fortune.com/2017/07/16/amazon-postal-service-subsidy/ > Either way, Amazon is hardly alone in getting a boost from the USPS’s complex pricing. Thanks to international agreements through the United Nations, international shippers—especially those sending small packages from China—often get services at substantially below cost. That puts U.S. stores and domestic online sellers alike at a persistent disadvantage. I used to work for a small time consumer goods manufacturer in the rural north. We did not recieve any such benefit for international shipping. Their international customers bore the burden of UPS' rate to get items to the border, a ~$20 Canadian customs rate to get it through the border with often a month long, sometimes longer customs inspection waiting period, and their domestic Canadian courier's rate on top of that. And now because companies like Amazon do get this benefit, among other benefits given to them by our government, more and more of their business is solely reliant on Amazon and they have no negotiating power. This is how increasing the power and scope of government over the production and distribution of goods and services destroys small business and innovation.
