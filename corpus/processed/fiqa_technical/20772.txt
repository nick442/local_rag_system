"It's like yelp has and has marketing value for some businesses. Business isn't one size fits all. If a customer asks ""What's your BBB rating"" then it has merit. You don't' want to insult the customer and have to educate them especially if they're older. That being said, being part of a Chamber or Rotary has value for some select businesses too but not all. Some people put weight in JD Power ratings. Those are worthless too but guess what, it's still a great marketing badge so it has value."
