"In regards to the suit: the flap in the back might have a few stitches holding it together and some pockets may be sewn shut so you need to at least cut the ones on the back flap. There's no easier way to show you don't know what you're doing than showing up with those stitches in place. Have a story ready for any BS interview question they could ask. They're all the same questions ""tell me about a time when you had to improve a project halfway through."" If you don't have a story for it just make one up but don't make it obvious. Good handshake with eye contact is necessary. I'll edit with more if I think of anything. I ran a professional org in college so I gave presentations on interviewing all the time. Just be yourself."
