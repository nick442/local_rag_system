"I'm an attorney so you'll have to trust me when I say that anything can make it to court. Especially if the people threatening litigation have the resources to pursue any claim, no matter how weak it is. Yes, the small business may win a motion to dismiss, but by that point you've shelled out a decent percentage of your profit on legal fees to draft and file a motion to dismiss. And if you end up with a judge who isn't that familiar with IP law, he may not even grant the MTD, and you'd end up shelling out more money for either a summary judgment motion or a full on trial. You may eventually win on appeal, but by then you've spent a small fortune, far and above anything you would have made in profits. Then there's also the question of whether they actually *have* a real legal claim. I'm not an IP lawyer, so can't say for sure. But given that we live in a world where someone can trademark the phrase ""You're Fired"", I wouldn't be surprised if certain jurisdictions would decide that this suit design is associated with the fighter's brand. And if they do, then they would lose on appeal too."
