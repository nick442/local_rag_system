People know there are lots of good colleges where you can get a 4 year degree for under $45-50K in tuition, right? It is a choice to go to a school where you will be $120K in debt. The gap between what people make who graduate college with a degree, and those who only have a HS degree continues to widen, does it not? Since graduating 4 years ago, I've never worked at a company who will hire a person without a degree.
