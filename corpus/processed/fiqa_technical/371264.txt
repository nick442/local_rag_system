I get it - policymakers are divorced from reality. So lets talk in terms even an idiot can understand: TV. Remember that show Breaking Bad? Now I need you to imagine a new season. Walter's replacement teacher - lets call him Tom - will have to sell the same meth to even afford living in a modest apartment and pay off those student loans. If Tom wants to remain a teacher, and afford to live, much less raise a family, he has to break bad just as bad as Walter did. Will you please give Tom a raise? To keep meth off the streets? For the love of God?
