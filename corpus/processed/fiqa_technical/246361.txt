Your link is something I know all about. Temperature rise, great, CO2 rise, great! Increased precipitation, awesome! Sea level rise, not a problem. 6 inches in a hundred years. Increased storms. The main problem with these storms is since population increases, the more likelihood it will hit someone. There is no panic right now with these storms. We have weathered them just like we have always. With increased precipitation, more water will end up on land, in aquifers and in our reservoirs. That would be fantastic for California. Not in the oceans, so that may help with the sea level rising. This is all alarmist talks, what we can see is record grain crops in Canada. So much that they had trouble transporting it. It helps feed the world. That's a great thing.
