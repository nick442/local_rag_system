For most people, the longer you have until retirement, the more beneficial a Roth IRA becomes. As you get closer to retirement, your income should be higher than what you earn now, pushing you to pay a higher tax rate than what you are currently at, even if tax rates don't change. You said you were fairly young. Let's assume you've got 35 years until retirement. Assume you make $50K right now, and earn a 4% raise each year. When you retire, a common goal is to live off of 80% of your pre-retirement income. 80% of your pre-retirement income will be $157K/year based on 4% raises and 35 years until retirement. I can't predict future tax rates, but it is likely to be a higher tax rate than what you are paying now. Say you invest $300.00 per month for 35 years at 9% interest (S&P 500 lifetime average is 10.5%). In 35 years, you'll have contributed $126,000. The account will be worth about $890,000. That means that you'll have $764,000 of gain. If you invested in a 401k, you'll pay taxes on every withdrawal from your $890,000 account, at your retirement rate. If you invested in a Roth, you'll pay taxes on your contributions of $126,000 and not pay taxes on the gains. This grants you some immunity from tax law changes or even large withdrawals to buy a house, boat, etc. during retirement. All of the taxes paid will be at your rate when investing.
