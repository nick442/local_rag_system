You can absolutely query multiple data points into a unified interface with Gsuites. Not to mention create in-depth dashboards that feed from centralized raw data (coming from multiple channels) and pushes it to charts/forms. The hotkeys are limited, continuously improving with other functionalities, but excel can certainly maintain more data. Probably one of my biggest painpoints with using Gsheets. Excel and PowerPoint produce cleaner and more manipulative charts, but overall, the fundamentals are there if you take the time to digest the differences.
