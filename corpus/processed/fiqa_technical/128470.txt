u just dont understand how econoics work. private debt was over 41 trillion dollars while public debt was a mere 8 trillion in 2008. giving pple money to spend will stimulate the private sector of the ecnomy to recover, and m2 will grow and generate much more lasting revenue for govt. you pple just dont understand anything.
