"Moving oil trade out of dollars into yuan will take right now between $600 billion and $800 billion worth of transactions out of the dollarâ€¦ When this happens, the US dollar should drop to about 50% of it's current value and at that point, the US century will be over. What happens after that is anybodies guess but I expect that the US will have to either use it's military to shore up the dollar in exactly the same way they did when the invaded Iraq to prevent the sale of oil in Juan OR the US will blink and it's expensive military around the world will have to be clawed back. Simply put, the US will no longer be the world's policeman""."
