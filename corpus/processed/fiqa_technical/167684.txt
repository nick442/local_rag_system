It is a Scam. Don't invest more money here. Their website is the proof. Investments may appreciate or depreciate and you may not receive more than you initially invested. The Peterson Group offers products that are traded on margin and entail a degree of risk. You may incur losses that exceed your initial investment. Please ensure you are aware of and fully understand the risks involved, and seek independent advice if necessary. Losses exceeding your initial investments does not sound a good investment even if it is not a scam. Not much contact information. Their contact page has only a form. No email. No phone number. No social media links. I would like to point some information from Dumbcoder's answer, Just browsed their website. Not a single name of anybody involved. Their application process isn't safe(No https usage while transferring private information). No names of the person's involved is a thing to notice. All the companies websites name their owner, CEO and the like.
