"Keep in mind one possible gotcha on depositing a bonus into your 401K: Tax withholding. Depending on whether your employer combines your bonus onto a regular paycheck, you can be bitten if you allocate a large chunk to your 401K. I suspect your bonus is, like most, subject to an arbitrary federal withholding requirement of 25%, and if you allocate 100% of the bonus to your 401K, the 25% withholding may come out of what would ordinarily be the take-home in your ""regular"" paycheck - leaving you with a literal take-home of zero for one pay period. There are lots of variables in that calculation, obviously, but it's one a lot of people seem to overlook."
