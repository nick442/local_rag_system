Tesla has 30,000 employees. The bottom 1.3% of any company are going to be pretty crappy employees. I know I work with people I think should be fired for laziness, nastyness or incompetence. It's not the company's job to pay people if they can't do the job. Good companies get rid of bad employees or they don't remain good companies. A key problem with most unions is they protect the bad employees and discourage outstanding performance.
