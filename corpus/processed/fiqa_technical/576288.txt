"I heard it was illegal to begin a new business while still owing the IRS. No such thing. ""Renovating business"" may require certain State licenses that may in turn require you to show that you've not violated any laws (including tax laws), so you may want to check that. But as a general rule - you can ""start"" a business any time you want."
