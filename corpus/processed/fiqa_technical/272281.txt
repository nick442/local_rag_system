"Not to discourage you, but I would say that photography could be fairly low hanging fruit. Certainly not with the ease of paper-pushing jobs, but I feel that things like how to setup the frame to appeal to human emotion could be done statistically. The movement of the camera itself is a solved problem. To take it even further, we are getting better at converting the real world into 3D models. I can imagine a camera in the not so distant future that just ""scans"" the scene into a 3D representation. From there, a computer could add a myriad of effects like lighting and depth of field dynamically, again based on those models of what appeals to people. With that said, you've probably got a good number of years ahead of you. I'm just not sure it will always be sought after."
