>exxon avoids paying taxes in the US on their profits [Exxon paid 31 billion in US income taxes on 73 billion in profits in 2011](http://finance.yahoo.com/q/is?s=XOM+Income+Statement&annual). They also paid local taxes, state taxes, property taxes, their portion of SS taxes, among others. Other years are similar. >like most multi national corps Wrong. [Read the GAO report on that](http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d08957.pdf). From page 8 it shows that in fact most companies actually do pay tax, and not many companies pay no tax over a very long period. Only around 2.8% of companies had no liability over the period studied. What can you conclude? Most companies pay tax. Do you have a source otherwise that is actually a study this comprehensive? You're probably confused since most pop reporting on this report did not actually read it, and just reported on what they wanted it to say. Don't let facts get in the way of your rants.
