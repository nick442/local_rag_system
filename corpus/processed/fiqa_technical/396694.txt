"Now, my own answer: If you join and receive equity, do the 1/3 split as a max. Truthfully, if it were my company, I would try to negotiate with you to only give you 15%--20% because as an advisor you're not going to be involved in executing the idea to turn it into a business. If you contribute capital, do it as a loan. End of story. You don't own more because you financed growth.. you shouldn't. The growth will have come because of the collective performance of the whole team. You should get paid back at a ""fair"" rate for your investment.. if the company can handle it, I would argue something like 10% interest is reflective of the risk you're taking with your money. If the finances are so tight that the interest repayment isn't an option, do the math behind what you should be paid for the loan in interest, and convert that to shares or equity somehow, and get paid back for the invested capital. If the company can't repay your loan, the business model may not be sound enough, or developed enough, to be investing in to begin with."
