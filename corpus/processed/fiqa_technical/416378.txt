"Can a company say ""StackExchange"" donate to a non-profit company say $5,000 in agreement that they will spend that on paying a designer for a new website? And most importantly is this donation still tax deductible? A non-profit would have to typically create a bucket for IT Services or Website design. As long as ""StackExchange"" specify they employ a profession service to get it done, there would be no issue. If ""StackExchange"" were to specify an individula/company it would be an issue."
