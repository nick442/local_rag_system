Dog walking business. Sounds stupid but it works around here. My gf currently walks a ton of dogs and we decided to just make it into a business and eventually hire people. Her schedule is full and she just can't walk every persons dog who contacts us, which is why we went this route. Edit: Oh, and very very far. About 2,500 miles. I'm on the east coast.
