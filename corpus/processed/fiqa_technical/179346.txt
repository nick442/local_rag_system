"One thing to keep in mind is that Prime day takes away sales from other days (maybe the two days leading up to and two days after). It would be interesting to see sales numbers by day around Prime Day and compare them to ""average"" days and see if customers bought less. Also, I assume the $1bn is Net Sales and not Gross Merchandise Volume."
