You don't need to be religious to know that the West is morally bankrupt. Like Rome before the fall. Institutions crumbling, debt ridden, counterfit currency, barbarians flooding in, corruption and tyranny rampant. Tolerance and Apathy are the last virtues of a dying society and we've got plenty of both.
