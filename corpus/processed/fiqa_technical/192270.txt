>Most people spend their 20s figuring out their lives and their 30s and 40s building their family and retirement. The Millenials simply have less to lose and have suffered far less of an impact. Totally disagree with the assumption you are making here, that millenials will all of a sudden start making a shitload of money in 10-20 years. When a lot of them can't get jobs after graduation, it prevents them from ever climbing the ladder at all. They can't get a professional job, so they take a menial job, and the longer they aren't in a professional job, the harder it becomes to GET a professional job. Many will be stuck in menial jobs their entire lives, simply because noone would ever give them the experience needed.
