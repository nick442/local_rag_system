I imagine we disagree on the following, but digging something from the ground or destroying mountain tops to obtain a product that destroys the health of its extractors, puts mercury in rivers, adds to climate change, and causes acid rain is not worth a few towns. Of course I don't live in those towns.. I would say they should be re-trained to install solar panels, but they will still have to move out of their small dying towns. Coal is going to die either way. The cost benifits compared to renewables just aren't there anymore. That is why that sector is already so small.
