"I see this as a silly question. Neither country will become ""dominant"". They're both mid-sized resource-based economies, and that won't change any time soon. Australia has more copper, cattle, and gold, but Canada has more oil, wheat, potash, and timber. The resource sectors in both economies will continue to thrive, unless the world economy tanks."
