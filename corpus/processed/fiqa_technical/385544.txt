"The problem with putting things back where you found them is that the things are a different shape now. You also have a responsibility to make sure you haven't made changes to the water table that would make putting things back a now larger, man-made problem (as opposed to a more minor natural issue). The issue with PV is really more NIMBY related than anything else. The ""rare earth"" materials needed aren't really rare, but they are *extremely* dirty to process into a usable state, which is why most of the facilities are in China."
