It's reminiscent of how state socialist governments made their own brands to sell through state-owned grocery stores. In this case, Aldi is making its own (low quality) branded goods (instead of allowing for capitalist/competitive brand selection) and excluding from its stores all other branded goods made by other companies. Aldi does not follow the Costco model. They're not comparable at all. Costco has yearly membership fees and you can buy quality name brands from them at rock-bottom prices. Aldi is not a membership club and sells almost exclusively low-quality in-house brands. Costco does have the in-house Kirkland brand, though it is highly lauded by its customers.
