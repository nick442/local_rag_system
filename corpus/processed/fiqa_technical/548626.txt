Does the one giving the gift have a spouse? My wife and I can gift up to $26,000 per individual by combining our gift amounts. If the recipient has a spouse, it doubles again, so long as we write the check to that spouse. Other than that, you make a loan and then forgive up to $13,000 in interest and principal each year until the loan is paid off.
