US corporate tax rates are extremely low- some of the lowest in the developed world. These inversions are a demonstration of how polarization/gridlock in Congress is practically as good for the rich as when their favored party has control. You don't need to be able to buy all of Congress, just enough so that they can't effectively regulate the economy and plug up these legal holes.
