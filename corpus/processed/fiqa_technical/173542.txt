"First of all, it'd be nice if you had any actual command of the English language as that would go at least some way toward mitigating the unabashed arrogance and idiocy of your arguments. As it stands however, do yourself a favor and leave eloquence alone; it's not your bag and attempting it just makes you look like a twerp. >When I analyze the actual information content of what you have had to offer in this exchange, I found nothing. Rather, I found ""you are stupid"" and ""you lack intelligence"". Perhaps a little, ""you are an idiot"". This is correct and deliberately so. I do not argue with idiots on the internet (except when I've been drinking, like now). It's like bringing a lawsuit against an insoluble entity: even if you win, you still lose. Why bother? >And this in response to a well-educated opinion: that the common misguided belief that this amorphous concept of ""luck"" gives lie to years of hard work, persistence and study. Lemme get this straight, your ""well-educated"" opinion was stated as, ""luck: what poor people use to explain away the efforts of the people who give them jobs""? Really? I don't know where you went to school, but where I was educated, such a trite statement would have been laughed out of the building as being the completely unsubstantiated ranting of a partisan boob. > You're someone who lacks any substantive contribution and tries to influence thought through intimidation. Nope. I'm not trying to influence you or anyone else. I just think that you are a two-dimensional buffoon and that's all that my original comment was meant to convey. Come back when you have the intellectual horsepower to compete. Meanwhile, get away from me with your clown-car of an argument; I have neither the time nor patience."
