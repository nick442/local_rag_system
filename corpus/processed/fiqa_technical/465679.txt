There's probably a risk committee and an investment committee where several high level executives analyze and discuss the investments they will do and which risk level to take. Is all based on numbers and evidence, but in the end people decide how much risk to take. Then there Risk Management I suppose supervises the risk and that they don't go over the threshold (measured by VAR or whatever)
