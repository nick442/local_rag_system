Everyone is worried about Google and Apple or Facebook. Amazon is just swooping in collecting all your personal info via Alexa and buying up businesses. I mean not that there's anything wrong with that. I am looking forward to the day, I go to work for Amazon, live in my Amazon house, drive an Amazon Basics car and wear my favorite Amazon clothes.
