">The inherent selfishness of mankind needs to be confined by the state for the greater good if entities fail to adhere to decent human standards. As an American, I've never been sure if this is a ""human thing"" or an American thing. I'm inclined towards the latter, because I'm living in another country now where there's no actual law requiring people close their businesses early the eve of a public/religious holiday, *but everyone still does*. Running errands at 2PM before a holiday (by the way, *every single Saturday* is such a holiday here) is actually difficult because of how many businesses close down and give people their time off. I've resented not being able to get things done, but *dear God* it must be *wonderful* for people with families with whom to spend the holidays."
