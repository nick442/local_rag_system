Let's see.. do you have other options? I have no idea since you didn't list those details. Doesn't sound like you've applied for anything. So, if you don't have other options, then yes, you should accept it. That's just common sense. If you don't have other options and you turn it down.. well, you deserve whatever happens to you.
