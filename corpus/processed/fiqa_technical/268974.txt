"I think you're thinking too micro and not macro enough. The main reason we buy things from foreign countries is not because we don't have the CAPACITY to produce them here, it's because they are waaaaay CHEAPER when produced offshore (mostly due to negligible labor costs). And don't get all straw man on us: of course there is demand here in the US. No Keynesian would literally suggest that there is ""no demand"". We are still the largest economy in the world. The problem is that there is not ENOUGH demand to employ a sufficient percentage of the workforce."
