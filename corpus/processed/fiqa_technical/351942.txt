Interesting. Very unfortunate though. I guess that means you have to work your way up through the industry to start your own firm before even getting to do the cool stuff. It makes sense, of course. Heck, I've always thought if I had lots of money that's pretty much what I would do. I'm not surprised that it's already a thing people with lots of money do. Even though it makes getting into the industry much less appealing.
