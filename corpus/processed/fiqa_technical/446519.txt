"My education helped me getting a job that allows me to pay for my livelihood. I thought I made that clear - but thanks for avoiding every meaningful discussion. You will just keep on asking meaningless questions until you find something where you can throw a chair at like ""ha you work, so you confess hating communism"". I think I made my point clear. And I think that was the longest ""discussion"" I ever had or ever will have with a Trump supporter. For everybody who wants to know more about redistribution or equality through working tax systems, that only favour the richest of the rich, watch ""Inequality for all"" with Robert Reich."
