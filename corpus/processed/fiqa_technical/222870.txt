> Bitcoin is backed by hopes and feels. Combine hopes and feels with the right tech advances and baby, you've got a stew goin! For real though, money is a social construct. It doesn't have to be backed by anything other than people willing to use and trust it. You're right, it's not the same thing as a stock. It's far more valuable; it's money :)
