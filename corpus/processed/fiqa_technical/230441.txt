This is so fucking stupid. If Megabus had an issue with the joint venture, they should have filed their complaint back in 2008 when the board approved the creation of Boltbus. It's obvious that Megabus did not expect Boltbus to succeed in the first place; now that it has, it's throwing a bitch fit to shut down it's biggest competitor. I'm never taking Megabus again. I'm going to tell everyone I know to neither support Megabus nor use their services. Even if they do manage to shut down Boltbus, I wouldn't take Megabus; I'd rather take a chinese bus or pay extra and take Amtrak. tl;dr: Boycott Megabus.
