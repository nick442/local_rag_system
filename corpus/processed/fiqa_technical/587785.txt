"There seems to be a gap in the internal logic of this story. > - Some enterprising person, maybe the merchant who runs the trading-post, comes up with the idea to just issue one note for all the farms in town. He calls a meeting with all the farmers, and proposes to have the town priest keep a book of certificates and so on, and the farmers will get notes just like everyone else in exchange for the crops they contribute to the pool, and the merchant will keep a cut of the crops with which to hire some accountants and farm-surveyors to estimate the total crop yields across town and so on. **[GAP]** > - Everyone agrees (or at least, enough farmers agree to kind of force the other ones to get on-board if they want to participate meaningfully in the town economy), and we now have something like a central bank issuing something like fiat currency: that is, currency whose value is ""decided"" by some central authority, as opposed to the kind of straight-up exchange certificates that can be traded for an actual apple from the issuer, for example. We went from a system where the underlying product (apples) could actually be obtained to a system in which the underlying product apparently cannot be obtained, leaving only derivative (if that) markets of people swapping notes for other products and services. Do you mean to say the ""enterprising person"" simply ended the ability to get apples and switched, cold turkey, to a new system in which the underlying product either does not exist or is not redeemable?"
