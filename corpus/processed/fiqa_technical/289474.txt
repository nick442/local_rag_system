"Lol master in computer science. I'm an idiot. K bro. I'm just calling it like it is. The problem with finance guys is they look at rich guys and accept their word as law. I don't care if this guy is a ""VP"" or whatever, I care if he has the technical chops to understand the technology. I'm willing to bet money he hasn't read a single paper on the technology, including the original Bitcoin paper, which by the way explicitly says do not speculate on cryptocurrencies (fun fact). I agree it's overvalued, but it's because traders with no idea of the real value of the tech are speculating. Everyone is speculating on crypto, but historically disruptive tech is far undervalued. Think Microsoft when the iPhone was coming out. People were literally saying Apps are stupid and will never take off. At the end of the day I have money in it and we'll see where it goes."
