> But the fact that they got hacked and she's a music major leads me to believe that she didn't know shit about security Which just shows how little you know of the situation. Its irrelevant. Utterly and completely irrelevant. She could have no degree she could have 9 security degrees. She could know everything and warned them for years, and she could know nothing and have ignored the advice of her peers. Her college degree literally has no bearing on that.
