According to this site: You can apply for German benefits at any U.S. Social Security office by completing application form SSA-2490. So have a look at this form and collect everything you need. But this site also says that you need to have at least 5 years of pay. Worker-Male or female-Benefits payable at: age 65 with 5 years of coverage.. I have found the info of 5 years minimum also elsewhere. So I guess you do not get any money from the Rentenversicherung (i.e. from the normal job) and I doubt that they will change that in the future. You may receive some money from your time as a Beamter and after 5 years as a Beamter it would be quite some money. But on some other site it has the 5 year figure also for the Pension: Die Pension wird für Beamte und Richter nur dann gezahlt, wenn diese mindestens fünf Jahre im Dienst aktiv tätig waren. They have also numbers to call on the first site, so you may ask them.
