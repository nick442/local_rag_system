> Eventually it will have to come to a screaming halt. That will be when Eastern Europe gets closer to Northern Europe economically, their strategy is ultimately self-defeating to the aggregate benefit of all. It's not a race to the bottom but a race to equilibrium. This is already happening in China a bit even though their per-capita GDP is so much lower than the developed nations. Whether it will balance out without a large drop in rich country living standards or large negative changes to inequality is less certain though.
