My take was that as a reactionary controller, Ballmer is shifting the company to an eventual dead-end. A new leader is needed, someone who takes action instead of reacting, and is open to creative ideas more than simply staying the course. Of course, Forbes had to write the article practically as a eulogy, rather than being straightforward with it.
