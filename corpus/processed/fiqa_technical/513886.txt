Sure, but what percent of Americans from outside the PNW make a vacation to Seattle/San Juan Islands in their lifetime (and particularly in their youth)? 1%? And what percent then get on the water and actually see an Orca? I took a week long vacation to Seattle recently and never saw a single Orca or even reference to one, and I went to the Seattle Aquarium. Fact is, a lot more people are exposed to wild life and educated about them at places like SeaWorld, zoos, aquariums, etc than they are in the actual wild. And exposure to animals has been shown to have a large affect on people's feelings toward them (particularly children). SeaWorld's treatment of some of their animals obviously isn't great, but it's hard to argue that SeaWorld doesn't have a positive impact on people's feelings towards sealife, possibly, even probably, having a positive net-benefit on their well being.
