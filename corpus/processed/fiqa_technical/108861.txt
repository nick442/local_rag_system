I remember reading that [he was responsible for siri](http://www.businessinsider.com/scott-forstall-apple-maps-2012-9) and that launch also didn't go so well. I guess Apple figured that 0 for 2 is better than 0 for 3 so better to get rid of his ass now before he fucks up again. And from other reports, people are cheering his departure ( [it's said that Forstall's coworkers were so excited to show him the door that they volunteered to split up his workload](http://www.theverge.com/2012/10/29/3574022/apple-scott-forstall-ios-6-maps-apology-letter)) so don't see how this is a bad move, other than Google or Samsung might pick him up, which I guess might be bad news for the apple crowd.
