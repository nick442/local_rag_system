Simply, yes. I graduated in 2010 and started in insurance. Then went to real estate accounting. I absolutely hated both insurance and accounting, so I decided to study and sit for Level 1 in 2011. I passed and received an entry level investment analysis job a few month later. I could not be happier. I would not have received the job without passing. Not only did it give me something to brag about in the interview, but almost every young person in the investment industry is attempting to pass these exams. The tests are only going to get harder and the pass rates are only going to get lower. I would try to pass these as soon as possible. At my firm, resumes that don't show CFA charterholder or candidate get left behind. I would imagine other firms are doing the same. Don't expect companies to pay for it, and don't let the price deter you. It will be worth it in the end.
