> The government can stimulate innovation yes, but only at the expense of someone else. I don't agree with this. There's a very good ROI on investments in innovation. I have applied for subsidies for research and innovation myself. For my government, a ROI of 2000% (!) in 5 years is what they are looking for. But they use a different metric: when I say I create a new job that did not exist that pays 50.000 Euro/year, this is added to the expected profit. New jobs at suppliers and customers are also counted. Everything is taxed between 30% and 50%. So the ROI for the government is there. The reason innovation in the States is slacking is because the Obama administration failed to invest in research and innovation. >The actual price of money itself is manufactured Of course it is.
