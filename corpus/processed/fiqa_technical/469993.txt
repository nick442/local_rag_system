This is stupid. Change the US tax law, that will fix it. Apple is avoiding taxes by playing an overseas card, are you getting rid of your iPhone, too, if you are about to boycott Burger King? Microsoft, is doing it, all the multinationals are playing games like this. I am not blaming them, I am just saying. More and more of the largest companies are leaving because of our excessive tax laws, we end up with lower net tax income as a result (fewer and fewer companies to pay the large taxes). These taxes also make us less and less competitive. Articles like this aren't going to cut it, waving a flag won't either. Oh, and don't get me started on the total stupidity on taxing US citizens living overseas for overseas income, even if they haven't lived or worked in the US for years. They have to pay whatever taxes of the country they are in, plus have to file and declare income to the US government, to also pay US taxes. I think only USA is doing that, btw. Look up how many people are force to give up their US citizenship because of these laws. That, too, has to be changed. The sooner the better.
