"That's all anecdotal. Actually, since you didn't cite any specific examples, it's not even anecdotal. Anyway, I can dig up plenty of anecdotes describing specific incidents of conservatives [rioting violently](http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/presidential-campaign/305749-republicans-employ-double-standard-to-discredit), and actively [censoring](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6sDqXRA5HI) or being [disruptive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgce06Yw2ro) towards people they disagree with as well (and ""as well"" is extremely generous, since you didn't cite any examples yourself). But isolated incidents don't a pattern make. You want to make broad generalizations like that, you're going to need data demonstrating a significant trend. As I already commented, the linked article makes my point for me. Someone conservatives disagree with takes office and they all make a run for the gun store. But of course you don't want to respond to this article. And this article is just describing gun sales, not actual violence. So let's see what the anti-defamation league has to say about conservative vs. liberal violence ([source](http://www.npr.org/2017/06/16/533255619/fact-check-is-left-wing-violence-rising)): > ""The far left is very active in the United States, but it hasn't been particularly violent for some time,"" says Mark Pitcavage, a senior research fellow at the Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism. > He says the numbers between the groups don't compare. > ""In the past 10 years when you look at murders committed by domestic extremists in the United States of all types, right-wing extremists are responsible for about 74 percent of those murders,"" Pitcavage says. So according to you (without any specific examples or citations of any kind): liberals are more prone to disruption and rioting. But according to the numbers, conservatives are prone to domestic terrorism and buying guns when politicians from the opposing party win elections. But liberals are somehow the violent ones and I need to ""stop it."" lol yourself."
