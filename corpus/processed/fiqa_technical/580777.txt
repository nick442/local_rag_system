So what you’re saying is that the undergrad level text (fundamentals of blablabla) is good enough to get a decent understanding of the concepts? I’m a bit confused of the two bcs for e.g. take Hull, the grad level book is more widely recommended. I’ll graduate very soon, enter the workforce, and plan to go to a grad school several years down the line. Now, being in a sort of break point, I’m not sure which one I should go for. I do have an exposure to read some finance texts, but not a lot—introductory chapters here & there—and would prefer texts that are not super dry. What do you think?
