This will probably require some explanation from you on the source of the money and the reasons for the transaction. Cash transactions over $10k will be reported by the bank (in this case) on a CTR report to FinCEN. Keep in mind, mere breaking the transaction into multiple smaller ones in order to avoid the CTR is on its own a criminal offense. Just deposit what you want to deposit, and report what's needed to be reported. Note that if you're a US tax resident - these foreign bank accounts must have been reported already to FinCEN via FBAR, if not - you should expect a very nasty audit with the IRS.
