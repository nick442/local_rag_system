"Loved this.. >A Philadelphia-area human-resources executive told Mr. Cappelli that he applied anonymously for a job in his own company as an experiment. He didn't make it through the screening process. --- And crap like THIS.. >Neal Grunstra, president of Mindbank Consulting Group, a temporary-staffing company, calls this ""looking for a unicorn."" Mr. Cappelli's favorite email came from a company that drew 25,000 applicants for a standard engineering position only to have the HR department say not one was qualified. One job seeker said ""he had been told he was perfect for a given positionâ€”except for the fact that his previous job title didn't match that of the vacancy,"" a title unique to the prospective employer. Is the reason why -- even 2 decades ago -- I refused to let ""HR"" do any filtering or ""pre-qualifying"" of resumes for me when I hired. (Because they have no idea of the *degree* of importance attached to any specific hiring ""requirement""; and that many of said requirements are not requirements at all, but rather ""it would be great if the candidate had XXX, but YYY will do just as well, depending.."") Also, this is why the BEST way to get hired (or to hire) is to do an ""end run around"" the HR department and get resumes into the hands of the hiring manager via networking -- preferably avoiding HR and the whole ""classified/listed job"" altogether -- HR can handle the paperwork around hiring AFTER qualified candidates have been interviewed."
