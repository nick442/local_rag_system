The 'uber' rich because they take chances that others aren't willing to. They also are rich because they make products people like. Take for instance Apple [or whatever smartphone/computer brand your so privileged to own] ,like them or not they make a great product (determined by the market). If the market didn't like it (Microsoft Zune) then it'll fail. As for the risk aspect, starting a business takes a TON of risk, and only after much strife and hardships can a business have potential to reach great heights. You think starting Popeyes's was easy? You think franchising is easy? Absolutely not! You sit there in your privileged high-horse saying the rich should pay because they make something you like and helped to succeed. It's like wanting something for free. Buy phone -> Others buy phone -> Complain about the rich and vote for UBI -> Get extra $ you wouldn't have gotten otherwise-> Spend that extra $ on the next years phone
