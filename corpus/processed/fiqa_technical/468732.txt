"I love the subtitle on this article - ""Silicon Valley deals are not based on factors that bankers can model"" and another quote ""a DCF projection would not be able to help Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook chief executive, work out whether Snapchat was worth $1bn or $10bn"" What a crock of BS. A DCF is exactly the methodology you should be using in order to value an acquisition (along with comparable company/transaction methods). Is it incredibly difficult to use the right variables and forecast the value of these companies? Yes. Is the inherent value of a company derived from the expected cash flows generated from that company once you acquire it? Yes. Just because it is hard doesn't mean you shouldn't do it. ""Big tech companies have never had more cash than they have today, and they are finding it just as hard to put their money to work as everybody else is."" Well damn then maybe you should return that money back to the shareholders **who own the company** instead of blowing it on dot-bombs at stupid valuation levels."
