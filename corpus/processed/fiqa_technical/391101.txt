> the claim that individuals will give up private ownership in exchange for order-up public vehicles It will be a combination of two things: * A clear advantage to doing so from an financial and practicality standpoing, and; * A regulatory mandate. It's hard to force people to do something that doesn't work and makes little financial sense; that's where the first tenet comes in. The second tenet comes in for those who simply refuse to go along. There will be people who privately own automated vehicles - just as there are people who own motorhomes or their own planes. However, there won't be any privately owned vehicles that are not automated that are allowed on public roads.
