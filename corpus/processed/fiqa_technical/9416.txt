I think Burger King is doing better on quality than McDo's. McDonalds, as a organization, can't seem to even manage to serve fresh, fully-cooked fries. You either get hot, soggy fries because they were busy and didn't want to wait for the timer. Or you get cold, soggy fries that have been sitting around since the last rush because the manager doesn't want it showing up on their food wastage stats.
