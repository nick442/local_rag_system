I can deal with the sometimes human trash that shops there, the screaming and running kids..and even the somewhat messy isles. For me, it comes down to two things: 1. Language barrier. If you are going to have staff on the floor, they need to be able to speak and understand English. This is an uncomfortable criticism, I know, but it is real. 2. Staff lack of knowledge of the products they sell. Reading the description on the tag of two different items does not help me.
