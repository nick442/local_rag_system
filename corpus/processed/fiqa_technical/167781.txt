If the money is a gift the lender will make everybody acknowledge that the money is a gift. They will not care if the gift triggers tax forms for the giver. Signing the gift forms specifying it is a gift when it isn't a gift is fraud, and there are penalties attached to that. If it is a loan that will not erase the PMI requirement. Because the lender for the main part of the mortgage will want to protect their investment. Related to other impacts.
