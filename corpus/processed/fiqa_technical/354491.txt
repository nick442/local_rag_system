>If you want socialized health-care then fine, advocate for the government providing this service directly. Attempting to get 'health-care for free' by mandating businesses pay for it is simply a wrong-headed way to go about it that guarantees less employment and less health-care for the poor. Funny, I seem to recall that being what the left was advocating for.. guess who didn't like that idea? If you said conservatives and the business community, you are right!
