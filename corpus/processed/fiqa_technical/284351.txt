People with failed businesses also often put in crazy long hours and submit themselves to huge financial risk. That's what you have to do just to start a business. It doesn't predict success. Why do businesses fail? I can now mostly predict if a business will fail because lots of people have ridiculous ideas or absolutely no way to make money (99% of businesses at startup events will not be around in a year). Luck doesn't predict the success of a business, but neither does hard work. I started 3 businesses in the past 2 years and they are all making money. I also put a ton of research into each one and carefully planned out a business strategy. Many people starting businesses either don't have the ability to do this or just don't put the time into it because they are afraid that their awesome new idea won't be successful.
