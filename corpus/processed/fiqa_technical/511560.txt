In most states, Car insurance follows the car, not the driver, so your insurance would likely cover her. Her insurance may secondarily cover her in your car under certain conditions (she'd have to call and ask to confirm) Of course, they might try to deny any claim if you misrepresented your application (where it asks about all drivers in the 'household'). One thought-- Consider getting a joint policy with both of your cars on it, the joint policy might be cheaper than two separate policies. Marriage and 25+ yr age is the holy grail as far as insurance companies go, but you might fare well with a joint policy. You could also consider becoming domestic partners if you're not quite ready for marriage and possibly save on health and car insurance.
