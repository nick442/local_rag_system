"If I was wrong please let me know how so I can learn for next time. This is way off-topic for Money.SE, but I feel compelled to offer my advice. Feel free to downvote and I'll consider deleting (or flag for migration). The mistake you made was not discussing it with your fianc√©e before turning down the offer. You are not married yet, but you have made a commitment that should mean that your decisions affect each other for the rest of your lives. She may be more hurt that her opinion wasn't considered in your decision. That doesn't mean that she makes the decision for you, but it was a perfect opportunity to make a decision together that affects both of you. Where you saw risk and uncertainty, she saw opportunity. Neither is ""correct"" - only two sides of the same coin. Hopefully it's an experience that you both can learn and grow from."
