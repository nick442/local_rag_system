"It's called paper trading because you do it on paper. So just do literally that for a little while. Write things down like ""buy 100 XYZ at $49.99 on 9/29."" Then note the price each time you look it up, graph it each day, draw trendlines, calculate your ROI, etc. In pencil or ink, up to you. It'll give you good insights into what all that software is trying to do for you, and when it's trying to fool you."
