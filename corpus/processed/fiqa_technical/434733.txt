Hello, I'mâ€‹ very interested in learning money. I used the search function, which led me to Investopedia, and already I'm learning a bunch. Could you recommend me some introductory reading on finance and economics? I have no education on this subject, and I realise that reading isn't anywhere near having a good formal education, but some knowledge is better than none. I'm looking to put this knowledge towards understanding what is a an enormous organ of power, and gaining the ability to recognise opportunities and profit. So yeah, economics and finance, but I will study anything you throw my way, so the more the better. Especially because investments and accounting also seem interesting and useful. P.S.: I'm European, if this makes a difference in what content will be relevant to me. Thank you for reading this.
