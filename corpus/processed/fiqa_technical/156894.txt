The two really aren't easily comparable - you have to look at cost of living. sdg's calculations account for provincial and federal taxes in Canada, but elide state taxes in the US. There's also sales taxes, which are usually higher in Canada, and property taxes, which tend to be higher in the US (from my experience). You also have to include health insurance into your calculations, since that expense is included in your taxes in Canada.
