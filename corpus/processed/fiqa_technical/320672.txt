"wrong! people create ""money"" by lending it to the banks.. Banks are effectivly just exchanges between depositors and lenders, i.e. an IOU exchange. When you deposit $1000, you LOAN the bank $1000. AND the normal way you deposit $1000, is by an IOU of $1000 by someone else like your employer, NOT by showing up in the bank with cash. (NB: checks are IOUs) The issuing/central bank do occationally create money, if the normal banks have more customers wanting to borrow than lend. However, that source of money may be raised by the central bank issuing bonds rather than new money."
