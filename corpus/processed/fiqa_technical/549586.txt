Losing the manufacturing jobs is a necessary evil of any developed nation. Yes Germany is an exception but that is only because they specialise in expensive high quality items. This transition has happened before in every developed nation when manufacturing replaced agriculture as the main sector of income and the same is happening again. The key is that we have to adapt and accept that rather than fight it. Fighting this transition will simply slow progress. People simply have to retrain and adapt to a knew skill set. Yes it isn't easy but trying to artificially stop low paid jobs moving to places with a cheaper labour force is impossible. Companies have to remain globally competitive. I appreciate if everyone globally gets paid a descent salary this wouldn't be an issue. However, this is not the case and will not be any time soon. The reality is manufacturing of non luxury goods will hardly exist in developed nations and will be solely down by the likes of china and india. However give it another 20 years china will be in exactly the same boat losing their manufacturing jobs to a less developed nations or maybe robots by then.
