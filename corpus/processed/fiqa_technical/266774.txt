The truth? Most of the time that it was a crappy imitator of MAD, it was actually a mob front used to hide and launder money. Management didn't care one bit about the content so long as it was turned in on time and seemed reasonably professional so as not to arouse suspicion (I knew someone who did some freelance work for them back in the day). I suspect that is no longer the case.
