Our consultant driven economy has removed all robustness from the economy. Their drive for efficiency has produced an incredibly fragile economy. Corporations are not suppose to retain any redundancy. They force this on subcontractors. As a result there are no trained and ready workers to step in as boomers retire. The tendency to rely on H-1B has caused young workers to avoid any field where they are likely to be replaced by foreign workers. Now that foreign workers are finding things better at home we have giant holes in the economy.
