"While you were talking about the creation of fiat currency (during the meeting with the farmers and the merchant and the priest), I was wondering how exactly that solved the issue of some farmers having questionable apple futures. Like, previously we established that since a certain farmer has a questionable crop future, he has to issue a certificate for extra crop in order for someone to accept it. Well, when all the farmers agree to receive notes ""just like everyone else"" in return for the crops they contribute to the pool, what happens to the farmers with questionable futures? Do they have receive less notes? Or were the notes issues based upon the apples they have pooled already by using the previous harvest?"
