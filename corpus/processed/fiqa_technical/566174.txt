If they wanted to surprise people, confirming it on the phone to a single LA Times reporter right after earnings, and right after saying a different number during earnings, isn't the way to do it. It's just not going to be 100k cars delivered next year. I'd love it to be 100k cars next year, because if that announcement came out, and the market responded appropriately, I'd make six figures in a day easily, probably several times over, since I'm heavily invested in stock and LEAPs. But it's just not going to happen. As for seeing Alpha Xs soon..yeah, that seems likely. Keep your eyes open and let everyone know when you see one :-)
