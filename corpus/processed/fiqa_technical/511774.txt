I didn't mean to discount her contribution to the company. On the contrary, I think what she does is great. She got into acting acting at a young age and made it big; she then leveraged her success to be a businesswoman. She won't be an actress forever, even attractive actresses like her will hit their expiration date sometime in their 30s. Being part of this start-up makes financial sense and is a great learning opportunity.
