Seen it on Netflix 3x already, pretty much catch all the diet documentaries. I can agree that sugar is problematic.. but it's ignoring a lot of stuff. I'm a whole food plant based eater and help others transition. The fat is a big part of it too. A domesticated animal has 7 times the fat that a wild animals has.. I had deer before long ago, it's so lean that many people find it unenjoyable (cuts tend to be tough), need to stew it or have to ground it up and cut it with fatty cuts of beef or something to make it tolerable. Same with rabbit and lots of other wild animal I used to have. Vegetable oils, like sugar, is also a refined and unnatural to the diet and didn't become widespread until modern presses were developed in the 19th century. It was just too wasteful for historical agriculture except for the wealthy.. with modern presses it takes 1000-1400 olives to make a liter of olive oil. Or 10-14 heads of corn to make a tablespoon of corn oil. Up to medieval times when agriculture was ekeing out a 10% caloric surplus over calories spent, it just wasn't viable to the human species to have the amount of oils we do in the diet. The fact is that all industries pay for scientific propraganda. Dairy/Eggs/Meat is no different. And since Marlboro (RJ Reynolds) [got into the food business](http://abcnews.go.com/Business/story?id=88088) buying Kraft and Nabisco and what not.. they had experience from decades earlier to know how to buy science and influence public policy. If it comes in a package and is changed from how nature made it, chances are that it contributes to obesity because it's been altered to cater to our tastes and that almost always means more fat, more sugar, more salt (makes us eat more) and ultimately more weight.
