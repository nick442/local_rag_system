"FOX is staffed by a lot of ""men rule the world"" thinkers. They don't respect women there. They choose women for their broadcasts based on which ones are the prettiest for TV. It's got nothing to do with journalism, and their male broadcasters are all pigs. Frankly everyone with critical thinking skills is surprised that it took as long as it did. MSNBC is just as bad as FOX. The particulars of their offenses might be different, but both organizations are corrupt to their cores. Punishing a few of their employees is not going to teach the other hundreds of people in their organization to suddenly learn right from wrong. And in the case of sexual harassment, even if the company spends millions on forcing employees to go to seminars and take special training, it's not going to change who they are. They're going to go home each night and return to being stupid sexist pigs. They'll just put on whatever mask and act is required of them in the workplace. The solution is don't hire people like that. When their behavior becomes contradictory to their survival under the law of natural selection then, and only then, will they change their ways."
