"**YOU** see nothing wrong with judging someone based on their support of a candidate who proudly advertises his chauvinism, lies about the most trivial things, uses bullying tactics to ""negotiate"", doesn't understand how to make a deal, has far more failed businesses than successful ones, has shown a disdain for actually learning anything about his job, is ignorant about basic facts about the job he's persuing, appoints a known agent of a foreign government to be his national security adviser, violates various laws without concern, gets most of his information from tv, and apparently is too lazy to actually do his job is a good candidate?"
