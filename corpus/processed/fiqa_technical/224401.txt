I think 3D has the potential and anyone already with a product portfolio ready to go will shine. 3D will take off in South Korea and the USA before it blows up anywhere else, though. Time will tell.. As far as Sony goes in the TV business, I've noticed that their prices have come down considerably here in Europe in the past 1-2 years. I would most certainly be willing to bet that this is due to the price competition the Koreans (Samsung and LG) are giving them. Without having ever looked at Sony's reports and knowing nothing about the fundamentals of the company, I wonder if it's able to still be doing well enough in its TV segment to compete or if LG and Samsung are going to kick them out of the market purely on battles over MSRP.
