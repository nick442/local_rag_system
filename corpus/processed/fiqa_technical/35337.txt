Marketwatch said that fedex cut capacity and raised prices. Interesting to consider whether this gives UPS a chance to steal some of their business. Perhaps people prefer better service as you say. > Fuel costs year to date at FedEx have increased sharply from a year ago and threatened to erode profit margins; Jet fuel alone was up about 42% in the recent quarter. > But by tempering capacity, particularly within the companyâ€™s trucking fleet, the company has been able to charge more for its service, Barnes said. > Though there may have been some loss of business because of the higher prices, expanding global trade has so far kept demand robust and most customers have accepted the new costs. http://www.marketwatch.com/Story/story/print?guid=708C76C4-9CC6-11E0-8019-002128049AD6
