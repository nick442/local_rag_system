All rules have unintended consequences. The more complex the ruleset, the more difficult it is to predict the outcome. The choice is fundamentally to constantly change the rules, and pile rules on top of rules, or simplify the rules and make them more permanent. If what the MP was suggesting was tax-code simplification in order to reduce the unintended side-effects then I would call this smart. However adding extra rules and making the tax-code denser and more difficult to follow I believe makes the 'intent' of the law _harder_ to follow, undermining the purpose of creating the new rules.
