"It's popular because there's not much to it. It's open enough that other messengers can access the network, and it just works for what it is without being super invasive. It's hard to monetize for the same reason it's popular: Ads are hard to make work because 3rd party apps accessing the network could simply block them. Allowing easy account creation without any real personal info means they can't sell user info very well. There's not really any ""premium"" content to sell without intentionally gutting features that draw people to the service. The best they'd ever do would be limited advertising with a fairly low saturation rate and add-on services for cheap -- maybe offering a subscription that included some cloud storage and an email address, but those are easy to get, so the margins would be pretty low. All the modern competitors have some pretty serious drawbacks, so I wonder what's going to happen here."
