He no longer advertises heavily in black communities, after tracking his stats for years, as inevitably over 50% of his black clients do not pay their bills unless you literally swing by their house to collect the check whenever they forget to pay.

This study indicates that not everybody should be getting degrees. And certainly not joke degrees that leave people unemployable/in debt."
