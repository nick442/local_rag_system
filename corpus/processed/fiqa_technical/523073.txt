I shopped at WF this morning and saw the alexa display at the entrance. It seemed to me that there were less staff people around, maybe it's just a wrong perception of mine but I hope Amazon is not letting go of staff because a lot of the good experience shopping at WF is having people around that know the store and you can ask anytime.
