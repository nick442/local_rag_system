A note on the article: I thought this article by Buffet on market level was particularly appropriate now, given the seemingly daily new highs, current level of interest rates (hint: they are incredibly low), and corporate profits (hint: they are incredibly high). If you believe the market will eventually revert to the mean, that implies substandard results over an extended period of time into the future.
