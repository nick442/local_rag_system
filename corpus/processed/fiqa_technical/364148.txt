"You're probably best off going to a different store to fix the computer. Right now you don't have ""damages."" You could sue him but, there's no thing to sue for. If you sue for your original costs, you'd have to return the computer and probably only receive a portion of your original costs, less court filing fees. If you have someone else fix your computer you can sue him for the cost to fix your computer. You'll take him to small claims court, win or lose you probably won't get anything from him. If you win, you'll have a piece of paper (judgement) that says, ""Yep, that guy owes you money"" if you lose you won't even have that. You could report him to the BBB or some other business agency but that doesn't help you fix the computer."
