"> fucking buddhists or christians or whatever other hocus pocus religions Racist. This right here shows exactly how backwards your views are. You religion is cool. Everyone who is different? Fuck em. Those are YOUR words. Being in the KKK is not a religion protected by the first amendment. That may be one of the dumbest arguments you've used (and you've used some REALLY dumb ones today). I'm so over this stupid conversation. I know you're desperate for the last word, so have at it. Make any last stupid, ignorant points that you feel the need to. Then you can run and tell your buddies at /r/the_donald all about how ""wrong"" I was. After that, you can fuck right off. To summarize: You're a racist piece of shit, your views are based on FALSE assumptions, and you're spouting ""information"" that is dangerous, stupid, wrong, and not at all based in reality. Have a great rest of the day, you worthless fuck. Good night, and don't let the evil Muslims bite!"
