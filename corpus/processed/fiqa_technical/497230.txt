I tend to go the motel route and the prices now are within 10 bucks of the AirBNB price, PLUS I can check in and out pretty much anytime, and I don't have to deal with weird locking mechanisms or hour rules. Just not seeing the case for AirBNB at the low end much these days, except I can sometimes find an AirBNB closer to where I want to be then a motel, for some locations.
