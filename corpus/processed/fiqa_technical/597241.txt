Thought this might be a bit useful for you.. http://www.score.org/resources/business-plans-financial-statements-template-gallery Edit: I haven't used their templates in a project before but, glancing at them, they look pretty through. Previously, I've created my own statements in Excel based on templates I've seen in old accounting books. Good luck with your business plan!
