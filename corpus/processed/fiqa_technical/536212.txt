"Essentially, yes. Any and all decisions a business make are for one reason: $$$ Your paid vacation? That's an incentive to get better, more productive workers. Your company has done a cost/benefit analysis and they've figured out that it's worth their money to pay you to do nothing for a week because that paid vacation is a perk of the job that will get them better job applicants. OR they want you taking a vacation because you'll come back rested and refreshed. And that makes them money. (See also: every other job benefit.) ""Oh, well my company is a great civic member who does good work for the community."" And I bet they never pass up an opportunity to tell people about it. Because they don't care about feeding the homeless kittens. They care about customers KNOWING they feed the homeless kittens. Because it makes them money. The point of a business is to make money, not employ people."
