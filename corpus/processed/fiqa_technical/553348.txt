Wrong message. I initially thought this was true, but it's not as cut and dry as people want to make it seem like it is. People usually try to say that he's just a bad CEO for Sears, and while this is completely true, the long game isn't as cut and dry. By buying a majority of Sears, he's using his power to authorize the sale of properties to himself, which he's then re-leasing back out when Sears fails to pay him (as Sears' landlord). Lampert isn't looking to fix the house -- he's looking to put the homeowner out of business, buy it, re-lease it to the homeowner, hike up the rates, then when the homeowner can't pay, re-lease it back out to someone else. It's very tangled and that's exactly why shareholders are going to lose big time when Sears declares Chapter 7 bankruptcy.
