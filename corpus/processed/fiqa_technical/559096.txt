"Henry Ford said something like "" I dont ask my customers what they want, They would just ask for a faster horse and carriage."" He also said that he would sell any color car the customer wants as long as it was black. Marketing gets a bad wrap because it is usually done wrong. In reality it is way harder to do right than finance. partly because there is no mathematical answer."
