Historically the advice was to buy the best policy possible (not cheapest), at the lowest price, with the highest benefit. The cost relative to the benefit is very cheap, and your much more likely to use disability than life insurance (for instance). It is usually cheaper to pay for it with after tax dollars than to buy more insurance. In theory, you want to buy enough disability to replace 100% of your after tax income -- or more since there is no inflation protection built into most policies. Insurance companies often will not sell this due to moral hazard -- although you may be able to combine policies to reach 80% or so. Keep in mind that you will need to continue to save / invest if you are on long term disability, since most policies cease payment at 65 or when your eligible for Social Security. In addition, your expenses often rise due to the increased medical expenditures, possibly needing COBRA / private health insurance, etc.
