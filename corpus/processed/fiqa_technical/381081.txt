The American taxpayer absolutely is subsidizing their business model. We are offsetting the cost of getting their employees in the door every morning. We're supplementing their workers' food budgets and medical budgets. That is money that ought to be coming out of Walmart's pocket. Listen, everybody who doesn't come from money is forced to work. Unless you don't mind living outside without medical care, fresh food or family. If you happen to have poor access to education or failed to achieve for some reason then you're forced to take what you can get. If that job doesn't offer a living wage than you'll have to pick up a few extra shifts or another job altogether. You want to talk about child-like world views? Let's talk about the one that you espouse where high school dropouts get to negotiate with corporations for a living wage and if it doesn't work out that's just fine -- after all nobody is forcing them to take a job. We have a social contract in our country. People shouldn't have to work more than 40 hours a week just to put food on the table or pay their medical bills. When that happens it's an indication that something is seriously wrong.
