> You've made half-assed non-sensical replies to all of my posts in this thread where you obviously have no direct knowledge of the industry. I currently have one citation, to your zero. I think my one citation, for a pretty big state in the USA, beats your unsubstantiated claim that you have direct knowledge somewhere *not in California*. The fact that you think this is remotely valuable to your argument shows that you also know very little about discourse. > You're the one that said you want to know where these markets are that have different laws. I want to know, in the sense that I want to hold you accountable for the claims you are making. If it's so easy to do the research, I'll leave it to you to make yourself look a little less ignorant.
