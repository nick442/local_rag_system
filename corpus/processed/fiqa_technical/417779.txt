You seem to be the ignorant one here. JPM has huge silver losses from many decades ago they've never had to cover. They also held down the price of silver for quite a while until their prop desk closed. They did the governments work of maintaining the legitimacy of the dollar. JPM is intertwined with the Federal government probably more so than any other bank/investment bank. Not mentioning the involvement of JPM and the government would be an argument from ignorance.
