If you want to combine old/new thoughts then maybe look af psychological or general theory of reflexivity. One of the underlying assumptions in big data and AI is that if you have enough data, you will have the truth. but then look at elections in the US and UK or the fact that no one can predict exchanges rates because the market reacts in a dobbel loop. how about some good old self-driving German cars as a subject? Lots of political, ethical, R&D, management and tech considerations are in that area, finde ich. Viel Spass damit :)
