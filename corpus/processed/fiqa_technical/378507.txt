Straight line depreciation is marginal as far as I understand. It would be a flat expense each year. Unless you mean 2 mil year one and 4 mil for years one and two combined and it's just written ambiguously here. It seems pretty straight-forward to me. 10 mil rev per year operating increase. 6.5 mil operation expense increase. Net income= rev-expenses. Depreciation expense is not an operating expense. As far as relevant cash flows I guess if there's not omitted info in this post would just be the cash for the initial investment, the added expenses, the added revenue, the salvage sale.
