Here's my obligatory contrarian answer.. No, the way the note was written, it wouldn't stand up to IRS scrutiny. Libertarians need to get a little more creative if they want to skirt the laws and make up a credible story about why it is a gift: Thanks for chatting with me at dinner tonight, I feel like we're becoming fast friends. I'm sorry you weren't able to sit down and eat with me, so here are a few bucks to buy you dinner/dessert when your shift ends. It's not a tip; your service was lousy! I'm still doubtful that this would stand up to scrutiny, but unlike the note that was left in the picture, it actually does have a chance.
