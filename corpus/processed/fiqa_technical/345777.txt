"Commentators say ""that's how capitalism works."" It's also how it doesn't work. At the extremes systems break down. A heavily socialist state couldn't move to American style capitalism. Too many parts don't work. Picture the US with 7 billion citizens. If 4 or 5 billion don't work, how does the system operate? There are limits and the argument is about where those limits are and what are the alternatives, besides war and plague."
