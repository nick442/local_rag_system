I'm old enough to remember when normal companies didn't openly associate their brands with politics, when Michael Jordan was willing to sell his shoes to Republicans as well as Democrats, and when companies and consumers weren't publicly shamed for their every perceived slight. Yes, I know business and politics have always been intertwined, but we've reached a point of dysfunction that I've never witnessed.
