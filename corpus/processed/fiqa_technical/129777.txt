Well they all went to college, but on the side did their own projects. They eventually dropped out because college wouldn't grant them wealth. They took leadership, and did it on their own. I mean.. would you still be in college knowing you built an enterprise that is currently taking off?? No. It's stupid to say DONT GO TO COLLEGE OR DROP OUT OF COLLEGE BECAUSE YOULL BE GRANTED TO BECOME A BILLIONAIRE. That's absurd. These drop outs had a plan already.
