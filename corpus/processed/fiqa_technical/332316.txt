This is ironic, because Softbank isn't even LTE-capable yet (or very limited in its offerings outside of major Japanese cities) and has ridicu-bad 3G network speeds in its home country. For reference, I'm living in Japan about ~50 minutes NE of Osaka. Switched to au last week, and even in my relatively boonie-ish city, it's hilariously faster than Softbank. Fix your home networks first, Softbank-kun.
