At least you did it right. The earliest lesson I had with this concept was from a friend who got hired for a summer to put page numbers in pdf documents (this would've been back when formatting pdf docs was still classified under Magic). She unfortunately like many of us stupid kids thought the world was a nice place. She just auto-formatted the page numbers in and then taught others how to do it.. Big mistake as she got terminated shortly after with the job finished.
