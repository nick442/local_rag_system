I hate apples business practice down to the core, but whenever a not-so-tech-savvy friend or older gentleman/lady asks me what I think about Apple,..I cite their customer service. A lot of the other companies out there either require a million dollar service package, or you are on the phone with a call center in India. I don't mind this myself as I love the freedom it gives me over Apple (Hell, none of my software/hardware (except my laptop) is an OEM package)..but for an older lady who just cant seem to figure out how to get her email open..an apple care center (or whatever they call them, genius bars?) down the road is a fantastic option.
