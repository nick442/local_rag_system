I fully appreciate your argument. I feel that the current system doesn't allow for the growth that you take as an assumption. The idea that somehow people will take a lower income job and automatically grow into a higher paying one. Companies hire smart people to maximize profit.. it's expected and it leads to trying to have a work force that is minimum wage with little room for growth. Further, I believe that minimum wage hasn't kept up with inflation. Yes, jobs are a worthy cry, but it cannot be the only metric we rely on to make sure everyone has the opportunity to live decently (a truly subjective term that we all have differing opinions on). I personally have met far more full grown adults with high school and even college degrees working low paying jobs than teens or immigrants.
