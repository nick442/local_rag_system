As you can imagine, this company did not survive very long.. The business model for this type of software is normally based on subscription revenue, which is typically 70% of turnover. The company had subscription revenue of just 30% of turnover due to piss poor customer support, and it soon collapsed as the market was saturated, when there were no more gullible customers left. The product still survives, but with just a handful of customers..
