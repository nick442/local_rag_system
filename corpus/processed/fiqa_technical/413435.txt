"The point of a business is to make a profit. End of story. And, they do pay a fair wage, especially compared to the other mass market competitors, which are not Trader Joe's or Costco. Due to the vastly larger number of items per store they need a different labor model, part of which is paying them less than Costco. Did you ignore where I said in rural areas they actually are one of the better and better paying low skill employers? Their profit per employee is just under $6,000, while for Costco it is over $18,000 per employee. ""Plenty of profit"" is not a good measure. According to your criteria, Costco should be paying their employees a lot more since they have a much larger profit per employee. And, no, low skill employees who are easily replaced are generally not going to get paid a lot of money. That is market forces in action. https://www.fool.com/investing/2016/06/13/what-do-wal-mart-and-target-pay-their-workers.aspx http://www.payscale.com/career-news/2011/05/target-vs-walmart"
