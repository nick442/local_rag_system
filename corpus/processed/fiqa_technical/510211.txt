The same banks that own those loan debts are also heavily invested in the corporations who provide workforce data for educational and job placement to the schools the debtors attend.. And the same Corporations who offer jobs to graduates- they can be sure they'll be getting pliable debt slaves right out the gate. They'll be good little taxpayers, funding the wars for profit contracts and corporate subsidies which are all good for the banks. People think they are getting education, but they are actually (by-and-large) getting shackles.
