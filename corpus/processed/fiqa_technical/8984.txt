Agree to disagree there man in my experience in la ive see way more fights,domestic abuse,drunk driving, than ive ever witnessed what youre saying data definitely supports my experience also. I gotta say law enforcement doesnt do much about what youre talking about because its just not as dangerous as drinking and harder drugs so that makes sense. I also dont like like people being trashy and doing those things you mentioned . I think you might just live in a bad neighborhood honestly in Venice maybe lol ?
