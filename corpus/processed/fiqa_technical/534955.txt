Is it your assessment that Western influence is exacerbating Africa's child labor/abuse issues or simply making them more visible? I think the article attempts to villianize consumers/corporations but there is an argument that things would be worse for African countries if they didn't have Western support/trade partners. I still think articles like this are important but the goal should be for Western corporations to use their huge influence to change third-world abuses. Pulling out our money won't help but using money as an incentive is a huge motivator. Anyway, I don't have the answers. Maybe an interesting conversation starter?
