"fiat in Latin means ""let it be"" or ""let it happen"" - as in ""fiat lux!"" meaning ""let there be light!"". Thus, fiat money means money that are created by the government decree - they would be random worthless pieces of paper otherwise, so the government says ""let this paper be worth $100"" and it becomes $100. Non-fiat money have some value that is beyond declaration - e.g., gold coin has the value of gold that is made of. Since 1971, almost all world currencies are fiat money."
