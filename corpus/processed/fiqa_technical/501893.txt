19 x 3.75 = 71.25.. without having to actually pump oil, transport it, refine crude, and deal with the health hazards of it. Not bad. Is this supposed to be a dramatic increase or decrease from the current market? Im not sure if im just being stupid, but I wish the article could involve financial comparisons of some sort.. because I'm just mostly confused here.
