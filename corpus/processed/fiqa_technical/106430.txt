Yeah because under those conditions, its usually a 50-50 joint venture with a Chinese company/local government - meaning its in the contract they show the partner how they do things and how their technology works they also lose control on who they bring in. At least with a wholly own factory, they can control who they hire and have heavy restrictions on who they show their technology.. Before you go on and say China will infiltrate with spies and steal their technology..When it comes to corporate espionage - what would be stopping Tesla (or any multinational company) from hiring a spy in their current facilities in the US (or anywhere else)?
