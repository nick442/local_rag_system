Wait. You equate public domain to being free. Public domain does mean that the source doesn't get paid. Remember when Its a Wonderful Life was in the public domain? TV stations still showed it, and they ran advertisements. Thousands of students each year buy Romeo and Juliet by William Shakespeare, and thousands of others purchase tickets to see their local high school perform the play, or watch a film version. People pay money for those versions because a person, or people, or a printer put work into producing the product. You can't take the files directly from Project Gutenberg and sell them, you need to add value. In the case of Huck Finn Google thinks that version does add value. Therefore they do allow them to charge for that version. If the work your propose to translate is in the public domain in the country you will be selling, then you can avoid having to pay royalties for the source material. But you will have to check the copyright situation yourself.
