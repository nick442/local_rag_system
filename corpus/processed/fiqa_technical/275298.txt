When Obama took office, the yearly deficit was $1.16 trillion, when he left office it was only $600 billion. Yes, the total debt continued to increase because he didn't manage to get us to a surplus like Clinton did, but he made a lot of progress. Compare this to the last three Republican presidents, W. Bush, Bush, and Regan, each of which increased the yearly deficit when they were in office. Trump seems poised to continue the GOP's record of fiscal irresponsibility.
