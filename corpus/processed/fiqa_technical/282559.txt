In a strange way I'm starting to like this guy. He is really a true reflection of what Washington has become. He is not the aberration, he is the norm. We finally have a President that looks just like the rest of our leaders. Vain, feckless, stupid, and self-interested. We're finally looking in a clear mirror.
