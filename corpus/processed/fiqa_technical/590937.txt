One of my first assignments in my new job was to prepare a presentation on the growing domestic oil and natural gas industry and I couldn't agree more with some of the assertions listed in FT's article. US production has slowed in the past few years, but seems to be poised for a very healthy comeback. Maugeri isn't alone in his predictions. In 2013 and beyond, opportunities in U.S. energy markets look plentiful; Citi and Goldman Sach’s research units are incredibly bullish for U.S. energy output, with Citi projecting the United States to pass Saudi Arabia and Russia in oil and natural gas production by the end of 2013, and Goldman anticipating the same transfer of dominance to occur in 2017. Beyond the United States, Canadian and Mexican output is also booming, leading Citi to call North America “The New Middle East”.
