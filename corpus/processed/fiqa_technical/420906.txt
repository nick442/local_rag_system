Summarized article: With declining sales over the last 6 years, Sears is now testing new store designs in Chicago, New York, Los Angeles and Dallas locations. The revamping initiative is part of new Merchandising Chief Ron Boire's efforts to recapture customers lost to Wal-Mart and Target. The store redesign will include placing best selling products, such as the Kardashian family clothing line, prominently near the entrance to the mall and cashier stations will be smaller and located throughout. Stores will also be less packed with merchandise so products will be easier for customers to find. Additionally, Sears' website and social media sites will be revamped to make them more personalized with local ads as well as offer a customer loyalty program. *For more summarized news, subscribe to the [/r/SkimThat](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkimThat) subreddit*
