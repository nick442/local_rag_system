33,000 killed and 3.9 million injured. Add up all the medical bills, insurance premiums, auto repair bills, some accidents require roads and other infrastructure to be repaired, productivity lost due to death or injury, productivity / time lost to traffic caused by accidents, any costs that arise from sick leave or finding a new job due to extended absences, and any other miscellaneous costs and I think it's more than feasible. That 900 billion dollar figure doesn't refer to how much the government spends on car accident related costs, it's talking about the economic impact as a whole. It specifies the economic costs are more like $270 billion.
