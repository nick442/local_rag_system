I'm amazed someone down voted you. ITunes is a bastard. I've got a new method for coping with it - if you're looking for a button or an option, look in the opposite place your intuition tells you to look. You won't be where you need to be, but you'll be a whole lot closer. Alternatively just don't bother.
