"The spin off and IPO were not to avoid conflicts of interest. They were to make money for the Consulting and non-Consulting partners. A lot of spinoffs weren't friendly. For example, KPMG partners didn't want to break off into BearingPoint but were pushed out by more senior partners. But in all these cases, the sale/spinoff of consulting arms made a lot of money for the partners (usually more for the non-consulting partners). edit: also Accenture can't really be considered ""Big4"" anymore and doesn't really compete with the Big4 consulting groups as they are a different kind of consulting company. Accenture is more in the lines of IBM, Dell, etc since they don't have the whole ""get rich as a partner scheme"" going for them like all the private Big4s."
