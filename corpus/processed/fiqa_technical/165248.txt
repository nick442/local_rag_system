"Financial services job? Sales? The reason is that many non-sales jobs require MBAs, and while there are lots of openings, there is also a TON of competition. Many people are getting MBAs right after undergrad and they're setting themselves up for some very good jobs. Don't believe me? Go look at some job postings for some very junior jobs. Nearly ANY manager role they want an MBA - even jobs that only require 2+ years of experience they're saying ""MBA preferred"" and you'll see that there are dozens of applicants for every position. Call up a recruiter, validate what I'm saying."
