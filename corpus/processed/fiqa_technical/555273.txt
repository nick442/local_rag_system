Don't know how it is in the US, but here in Montreal, something like 95% of customers pay by cards where the tip amount is extremely traceable. So you end up declaring everything you make. Waiters want to keep working for tips because that's how they make good money. And it's a direct correlation of effort and reward. You make your money on volume, more than individual tip amounts (you're better off taking 2 tables and receiving a regular tip, than taking a single one, providing amazing service and get a great tip). So when it's quiet, you don't make much, but you didn't work too hard. If you're getting destroyed from 5pm to 1am, short-staffed ; you work like a fucking slave, but you know you're making bank. Tips is nothing else than a sales commission that is disclosed to the customer and which they can choose to adjust based on their experience.
