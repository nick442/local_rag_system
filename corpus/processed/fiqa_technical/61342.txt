There is a theory that the reason this has come to pass over millenia is simply because Europe has harsh winters, whereas South America, and Africa, and most of Asia do not. The theory is that having to deal with winter - including all of the long term planning, logistics, and infrastructure that go with it - was a forcing function on society that caused Europe (and later on it's settlements) to advance more rapidly. It has nothing to do with skin color and everything to do with seasons.
