At my farm our turkeys live their entire lives outdoors on pasture (except for the first three weeks when they need artificial heat to survive); they don't receive any medications or antibiotics; and we slaughter them ourselves without pumping their carcasses full of.. whatever butterball pumps into their turkeys. We charge $3.75 a pound, so our birds range from about $45 to $75. What ends up being really expensive are heritage turkeys. These are old-fashioned breeds that gain weight very slowly and have a huge feed-to-weight ratio. They take much more feed and labor for the same amount of weight, and so are often upwards of $6.00 a pound. We don't raise them because one of our goals is raising good food that normal folks can afford. Also they can fly, which throws our whole raise-them-outdoors system into logistical chaos. Naturally raised turkeys are there to be had, but you have to look for them. Check out [Eat Wild](http://eatwild.com/) to find a pasture-based farm in your area that raises turkeys. Good luck!
