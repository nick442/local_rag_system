It would depend on the market you are in, state/city. 15k isn't a lot to get started on anything really serious. As for kicking the guy out? Wouldn't that take money away from your father from rent? If you know anything about PC repair, you can go get your A+ cert and setup shop in your home, and leave the money coming in for rent. Build up a client base and when you start growing, rent your own space or then kick the guy out. Crawl, before you walk. It seems you want to start out running. Overall, I would just say look at your local market, and figure out what they are in need of, then go from there. That is the safest way you could possibly use the money. If you know anything about cars, you can go to auctions, and ads in the paper, buy cars, fix them or put them up for sale. Ideally you could buy about 3 or 4 cars with that money, then make about 1k on each by reselling. Depending on your area after 3 cars in x amount of time, you may have to get a dealers license.
