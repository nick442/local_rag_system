So what about the person who wins the lottery, was he or she not lucky? Luck 100% exists. Maybe some people are able to better manage the amount that luck impacts their life, but no matter what luck plays a huge factor. You could one day be walking down the street and get hit by a drunk driver or you could have been born with a mental disorder - since most things are out of your control the result is that there are countless other events which could have occurred and would have stopped you from being where you are. Does this mean you don't deserve credit for taking advantage of your lucky situation? Obviously not, you did take advantage, and you do deserve credit, but to think you are in control of every possible outcome is ridiculous.
