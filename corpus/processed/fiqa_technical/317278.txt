"Did a math undergrad, this is apparently super common in math/compsci departments , especially Adderal. I suspect the numbers are far lower than stated, however. They help you with mindless, repetitive tasks or cramming, but most of those kinds of drugs are just going to fry your brain, prevent you from thinking abstractly, and eventually turn you in to a zombie. It's actually very frightening how non-chalant people are with (potentially dangerous) drug abuse. Taking care of your health; sleeping and eating well, will go a long way towards keeping you in peak condition without substance abuse. I get that in some fields (finance inclusive) the hours and workloads are almost fetishized amongst juniors, but personal health is just so much more important than trying to win the ""longest hours"" competition. With all that said, I obviously don't take them, but do love coffee and probably drink a bit too much in a day."
