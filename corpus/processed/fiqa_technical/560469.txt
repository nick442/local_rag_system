It's not like bankers and politicians forget what happened then, and the biggest causes of the 2008 crash began in the mid 90's and early 2000's. nobody went to prison for the crisis because there was no one who actually committed criminal acts, people were just stupid and figured debt would be forever cheap and the market would never decline. And the regulations that are being rolled back actually made big banks more powerful because only they could afford the compliance costs. Just like after 2008, your best bet in dealing with a crash is just hold everything you own, because if you sell into a decline, you have less money to buy when the market rebounds
