I thought the same thing when I was in high school. But I worked several jobs ranging from $7.25 to $12 an hour. It's about not being complacent and going out there to look for other, Better paying opportunities. And at the end of the day, if your labor can only command a shit wage then go get some skills. Go EARN a higher wage.
