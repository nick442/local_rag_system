"There are two things I would like to add. By no means am I an expert on this, so please call me out if you spot a mistake. > Economic contraction scared people. So instead of continuing making promises, they started paying off the promises they had Every true.. **expect** this didn't cause the ball to stop rolling so much as it stopped the ball from rolling a little sooner than it otherwise would have. As pointed out in the comments above, money is debt and with debt (in the system we've chosen to adopt) comes interest. That means that new money **must** be created in order for old money to be repaid. Which leads to a need for perpetual growth. And perpetual growth is unsustainable. Pure and simple, it doesn't exist. So yeah, people got a fright and that put the brakes on the economy, but it was going to happen eventually. > People paying off debt is fine so long as there is sill money for services, and people paying for service is fine *so long as they don't rack up more debt than they can pay*. As explained above, this is a fallacy because our monetary system literally requires that people aren't responsible when it comes to debt. Eventually we'll get to a stage the vast majority of people have taken on as much debt as they can logically support, at which point they would need to take on even more debt in order to service the debt that already exists. It's either that or the money supply contracts and you have a recession. It always disgusts me when I hear people saying things like ""they should known better"" or ""this is what you get for not handling your finances correctly"" when describing people that get into debt issues. The system literally depends on people acting like idiots and taking on more debt than they can support. It's also a reason why you can't really blame Wall Street for what happened - even though they did some messed up things, they were just playing by the rules of the game."
