ETFs don't need sell-side research (yes they do, no they don't). They need to keep their fees minimal. Mutual funds need equity research and they charge beefy fees to pay for it. Look at the flows into mutual funds and the flows into ETFs and make your own mind up. However, bear in mind that there will always be *some* demand for really good research. It just probably isn't a growing field. It will be a shrinking field where the best of the best do well and everyone else is playing a game of Survivor trying not to get kicked off the island.
