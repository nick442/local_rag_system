"I just opened up the Roth on my own, with some savings. I was then about to roll over the old company 401(k)s, but didn't see ""Roth"" indicated on the statements for those. All these years I've known that Roth is the way to go, and thought that's how I've been investing.....but apparently, you can only open a Roth personally, whereas the company 401(k)s are standard. I'm currently not working so I guess that counts as ""low income year""? But we file jointly......gahhh!"
