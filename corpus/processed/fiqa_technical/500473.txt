HFT firms are spending millions or billions on network infrastructure and colocation for a reason. It's arbitrage. I'll take your word for it that transaction costs are lower today than they were years ago, but HFT front running is happening. HFT firms are paying for a privileged position in the exchanges that is unavailable to others. That's not ok. I don't care how much liquidity they supply or how small the spreads get. At any rate, *someone* must believe in what IEX is doing because otherwise there would be no volume there. They're approaching 1% of the market volume after opening a few months ago. People aren't trading there out of the kindness of their hearts, they are trading there because they believe they are getting ripped off in the other dark pools/exchanges.
