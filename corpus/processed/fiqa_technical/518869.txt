This could backfire. I was a field service engineer for Ford Motor Company in the early 1990s, and they offered an extended unlimited mileage warranty to customers (at an additional cost of just under $1000 per vehicle.) Several fleet customers bought hundreds of vehicles and began driving them 24/7 - we had several trucks that we chose to buy back from customers that had exceeded 500,000 miles in just a couple of years. People will take advantage if you give them an opening.
