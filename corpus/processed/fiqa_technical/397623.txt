> Not asking for any societal benefits. Sure you are. You want to live in a society with other educated adults, with roads & other utilities, property rights, safe food & water, a medical safety net, , etc. You just don't want to have to pay for any of it yourself. It's this kind of hypocritical attitude why people can't take anti-government zealots seriously. If you really believed what you say you do, you'd move out of the country, leaving behind every single benefit you ever got from living in a first-world country, and then live by yourself not paying any taxes. But you don't.
