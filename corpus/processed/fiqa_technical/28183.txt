"In some sense, I agree, but let's look at Apple who in 1997 when Steve came back as CEO and had to beg monies from Microsoft (which he received as a professional courtesy) to stay afloat swore he would never have to do again and literally deemed investors as a ""necessary evil"". He presided over one of the most profound rainy day funds (which eclipsed the US Government for a few days in its depth) because he never wanted to be in that position again. He died and Tim Cook initiated splits and buybacks. I think Cook went too far in one direction and Jobs in the other. Another stock to consider in a similar light is Starbucks. But these stocks are performing, I'm an investor, and I'm not going to complain about management decisions when ROI is at are above 20/30ish percent. Other companies like Thomson Reuters fail to achieve a cohesive diverse presence in multiple markets inexpensively sans their newsdesk operations. I'm not saying your wrong, it's just a formula of trust and strategy."
