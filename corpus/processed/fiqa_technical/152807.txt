Capitalism finances an expansive state; see: Military-Industrial Complex, Prisons-for-Profit, etc. Capitalists bribe whatever state exists to profit themselves. If the state is small, they argue that part of it that would benefit them should be expanded. If the state is large, they will simply co-opt what exists, through bribery or plush post-government jobs. In the unlikely event you were able to keep the state small in the face of billions of dollars of bribery to elected officials and marketing to rubes, the *global* corporations would have it that much easier, wouldn't they?
