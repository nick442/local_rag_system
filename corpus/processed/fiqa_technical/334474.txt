This argument appears to assume that premiums will remain the same. You have to ask: If autonomy reduces the frequency of accidents, why would you consider to pay the same insurance premium for the product? If Geico was selling a product that had a $1000 premium with a 50% margin, but is now selling a $200 product with a 75% margin, it's making a heck of a lot less in aggregate. Can't say that's a good thing.
