"Just remember that the numbers can be quite remote from the realities . Look at the corporations that are crashing and ask yourself - ""would any of the numbers have told me what was going wrong with the corporations and what needed to be done to fix them ?"" . Look at , for example , Sony , HMV , Best Buy etc. ."
