"Im honestly trying to find your arguement for drug testing, other than ""this is my business, so its my freedom of choice"". I have no objection to that but that the large scale of what drug tests cost to business and our community as a whole is a very bad use of time and resources. The fact that most drugs are flushed out of your system in 3 days, except weed, makes the topic of medical cannabis that much more complex. My arguement is to treat drug use as mental health issue, not continuing to fuel further criminal harm to society. I understand how we test people say after a road accident, which should be a good indicator to whats harming us the most. When was the last time you saw a road sign read ""Please dont drink and smoke""? Because we all know how dangerous is to get behind the wheel and not drink, right? You nailed a bunch of points that drug tests dont really work and ultimately fuels the fake war on drugs. I could care less how you would conduct your business, especially if you respected how I handled mine, just please stop fueling the fake war on drugs."
