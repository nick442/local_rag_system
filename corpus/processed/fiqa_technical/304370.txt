Toyota has some of the ugliest cars around. They are so ugly that it seems like their designers spare extra effort to see who can come up with the ugliest look. They are reliable and less fun to drive. If I am in that segments I would rather go with a Honda or a Mazda. Equally reliable and lot more fun to drive, specially the Mazda.
