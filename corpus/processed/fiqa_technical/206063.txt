My own. Could be a pair trade or outright. I take positions that i believe i can sell later. Or short them then buy back from client. I usually have a lot of small positions and several large ones that i watch like a hawk every day all day. I mostly trade safer big cap stocks. Banks, insurance etc. nothing too risky. No penny stocks. I hedge with etfs.
