Its expected earnings are what people are valuing it at. They have built a huge demand by having superior previous models. The true question is if they can replicate this on a large scale, and keep enough of the quality and perks of the previous models to maintain the demand. If so you have the biggest shift in car manufacturing in the US market in a long long time. To be honest idk if they can remain at Tesla headquarters at the desired level of production but bringing production back to Detroit while cheap doesn't have the engineers and control that they have in California.
