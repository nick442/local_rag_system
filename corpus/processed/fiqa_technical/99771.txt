"Seems pretty shady. From what I could guess, your dad ""hid"" or ""lost"" the money, so as to not pay capital gains on it. Even though he'd use the money to build houses or whatever, he'd have to pay taxes on it (as income). To get out of paying said taxes, the money would essentially have to disappear. This isn't super common, but it sort of is possible to move funds to other places around the world, or to keep cash that no one knows about (watch the Swiss bank part of Wolf of Wall Street or just read up about illegal money laundering, like gangs and such do). So possibly, your dad could launder the money over the next several years. If I were you, I'd just stay quiet and mind my own business."
