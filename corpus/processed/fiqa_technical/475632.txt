In the US you can get a home warranty when you buy a house that will cover major repairs for the first few years of owning a home. The costs vary based on age and the results of the home inspection. Ours cost ~$250 a year. This was put into our closing costs. Unfortunately this market does have some disreputable companies that come im with prices that seem too good to be true. As is usually the case they are. Do research on the company you are getting the home warrenty from to make sure you are dealing with a reputable company that will honor its commitments. By having 20% down you will avoid needing Mortgage insurance which will save you a considerable amout. My PMI cost me about $70 a month. However once you get to 20% equity in your home the pmi drops off. So if you can put down 15% you should be able to get out from under your pmi in a few years if you want to keep that 5% cushion while making extra payments. The question is how much do you feel you need. So far owning a 70 year old home my extra maintence costs have been around 2500 a year. But they seem to be in 1k chunks every 4 or 5 months.
