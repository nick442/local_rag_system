Hahaha wake the fuck up kid. I'm going to hit you with some deep shit here, I started off as an Technical Analyst at one of the largest banks in the world and quit after a couple of years because the work was boring, I then went on to work as Mobile/Web Developer again for a large enterprise however I did some startup work and freelancing in between, and if there is one thing I learned then it is that you gotta put in the hours to be successful and that it doesn't matter what your job is. If you want to make it you can't be one of the 9 to 5 wankers you need to do more, if you're good you'll do it in the regular time but if you're working in a decent firm chances are that your competition is tough and the extra time is a must to have a lead and maintain it.
