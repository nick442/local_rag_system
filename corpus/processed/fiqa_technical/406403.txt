Google doesn't make money from their browser, they make money from searches, advertising, and their ability to catalogue data. As long as Firefox is open, it's in Google's interest to have it around, even if it costs them a small amount. Better Chrome + Firefox than a market dominated by Microsoft or Apple or Facebook versus Chrome alone. At least for now.
