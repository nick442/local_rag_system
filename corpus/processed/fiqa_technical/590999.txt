> When that guy says you can go to 30A on a fuse, how do you feel about his opinion as an electrician? > Still say that non-electrician decisions have zero bearing on how you feel about his abilities as an electrician? Do you have a friend who's really good at math, but sucks in social situations? What about a cousin who's really good at interior design but is an awful driver? If your electrician friend has a long history of giving good electrical advice, both to me and others, then they have a long history of giving good electrical advice. I wouldn't expect that to change because they gave me bad dinner advice. Tiel has started multiple multi-billion dollar industries. He's served on countless boards, and taught business classes at Stanford. His skills in _business_ have been verified by other entrepreneurs, professors and personal history. I know people who'd give their left leg to get _business_ advice from him. He's also known to be a raging asshole. Not just in voting for Trump, but pretty much everything else. There's his personal vendetta against Gawker, and how he throws his money around to keep surfers from walking on his beach. I wouldn't want to grab a beer with the guy, but that doesn't affect his area of expertise.
