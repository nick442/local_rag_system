">>You do realize that just because you quote the Bible doesn't mean you have morals. Obviously, you didn't understand my point. The utopian ideal of everyone having the exact healthcare they require (or really desire) is the LEFT's standard. It's ignorance of Christian morality to say that's what their beliefs dictate. >>For the record, wealth distribution is perfectly acceptable. Funny how Republicans hate it, but don't have a problem with ""trickle down economics"". You're referring to crony capitalism in essence (favorable tax status). Now there's some real hypocrisy by both sides! I love my solar subsidized green electrcity almost as much as my subsidized gasoline!"
