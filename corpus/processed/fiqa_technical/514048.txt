If you feel the house will appreciate, I'd say go for it. I'm not familiar with the Denver market but real estate can be a great way to build wealth. Besides, it seems like at this point you would lose your earnest money deposit if you back out. I do agree with people here though about the potential risk. The only way to make money is if the property appreciates. In Seattle, properties have appreciated like crazy in the past 5 years. Some have even gone up by 3x or 4x of what it was before. If you are right about appreciation in your market, this could be a gold mine. With all investments, there is risk involved. If you do plan to move forward, here are some suggestions: Best of luck!
