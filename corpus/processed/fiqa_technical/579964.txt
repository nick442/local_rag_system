Why do they hate teen workers, people with serious disabilities, and those who never had an opportunity to complete high school? Every employee must produce goods and/or services at least equal to the cost of their employment. Edit to add that people in these situations CAN and DO contribute to their employer and society. They also benefit from employment. When the bar is set artificially high, they lose the opportunity to do so.
