"Today sure, but that market is similar to day trading in it's volatility. It's great for individuals to make some money in the short term but it's not a good product to build a company around. Especially since the corporate giants already own the entire marketplace. And you need to take seriously that they have a 50/50 success/fail rate. Facebook is succeeding, Twitter is failing. That's not an indication of stability. Anyway you need to understand the technology and the consumer marketplace to really know what you're talking about and I suspect you don't. No offense intended. I've been using the internet since before computers were ""cool"" and I do know what I'm talking about."
