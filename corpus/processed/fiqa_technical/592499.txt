Does your employer prefund benefits for employees that haven't even been born yet? Or better yet, their parents haven't even been born yet. They're required to fund their pension plan 75 years in ADVANCE. There is literally no other government, nor private agency required to do that because it's asinine. Congress was purposely trying to bankrupt the perfectly functional post office in order to sell it off to the highest bidder. As a Chicagoan, let me tell you that privatizing public assets does NOT work. Edit for spelling
