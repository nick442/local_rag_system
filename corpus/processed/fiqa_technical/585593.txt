"Wait, correct me if I'm wrong, but this is how I thought it worked: ""say you work 40 hours a week ""during a recession, NO ONE GETS FIRED ""instead, they cut your hours ""from say 40 to 32 ""THEN unemployment benefits make up the difference in that eight hours you're not working ""then you get hired again"" This seems like the best system ever and something America should do. No one gets fired, and companies save oodles of money not training new workers."
