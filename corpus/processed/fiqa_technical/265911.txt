My son worked at our local Applebee's as a waiter while in college a few years before they closed. The statement that they microwave food is absolutely true and it comes in prepackaged portions. I agree we should all seek out restaurants where they actually prepare and cook fresh food daily! The fact that they charge 14.99 for a frozen microwaved pasta dish is unbelievable. My advice to Applebee's; worry about the quality of the food first and hire real chefs instead of trying to line corporate executives pockets with money.
