You raise several points. 1) Your citation on family income decline? 2) I'm not denying anything, I just think that if one was going to say 'toy sales are down because people have less money,' then that argument also should hold for other non-necessities, like apps. But that's seemingly not the case. IDC (December 2010): In 2010 these 300,000+ applications were downloaded 10.9 billion times. IDC predicts that global downloads will reach 76.9 billion in 2014 and will be worth US$35 billion. ABI Research (October 2011): Predicts that there will be 29 billion apps downloaded in 2011, up from 9 billion in 2010. In Q2 Android overtook Apple in terms of app downloads with 44 percent of downloads, compared to Appleâ€™s 31 percent. Revenue from apps: Canalys (June 2011): Predicts that direct revenue from the sale of apps, in-app purchases and subscriptions across smartphones and tablets will be $7.3 billion in 2011 rising to $36.7 billion by 2015. I could not specifically find data on game apps, but given the overall rising tide of app sales it seems to follow that game apps would benefit from that, too.
