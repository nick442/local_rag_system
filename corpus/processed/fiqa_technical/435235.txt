> You are assuming Romney would actually allow for Free Markets, that's a laugh! Invoking the Free Market Fairy is about all anyone can do anyway. Magic is as magic does. > You are also assuming Romney would do absolutely nothing. You see, if Romney won and the House stayed republican, we'd see tons of legislation, crony, corrupted, bullshit, but legislation nonetheless. Yes, yes we would. At the moment the House of Representatives and White House are at odds with each other. When they're on the same side you'll see lots more legislation to support their cronies such as tax cuts, corporate welfare, regulatory protection of broken business models and so forth. Much, *much* more than you see coming through now. Like I said, you may not think there's a huge difference with Obama in office, but there is a difference. > Romney is no bigger of a crony capitalism than Obama, considering Obama has not jailed a single big bank executive for their role in the 2008 meltdown, all this talk about how they differ is bullshit. Romney is **much** more of a crony capitalist than Obama. He doesn't even *try* to give lip service to anyone who isn't in the 1%. That you don't want to see the difference between them doesn't mean it isn't there. > That's a laugh. What? There's not a single soul in the entire nation who fits this description? I find that hard to believe.
