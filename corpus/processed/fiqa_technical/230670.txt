> I've done the math - I had to, as I received a bay area offer. [Oh really?](https://smartasset.com/mortgage/what-is-the-cost-of-living-in-san-francisco). In san fran, * Housing prices are 3-3.5x * Rent prices lead the nation, 30% more expensive than the closest city (New York!). [This is across the board, and roughly 2-3x the national average](https://www.apartmentlist.com/rentonomics/national-rent-data/). In fact, the average rent for a 2 bedroom in san fran exceeds the median salary, nation wide. * Downtown parking is [2-3x the national average](http://cityobservatory.org/the-price-of-parking/), and second only to places like New York. * Gas is 38% higher in san fran over the national average. * Basic food staples, like eggs and cheese and meats are 30-70% more expensive. * It has the highest patient costs for routine doctor visits compared to anywhere else in the country. You're spreading uninformed propaganda. If anything, it's worse than I mentioned above. Since costs range between 30 and 300% of the national average, the higher % for the large chunks of a family's pay check. > It's only housing, which is not a big enough of a expense to come even close to your outlandish claim. HAHAHA. That's a good one. It's almost like housing [isn't the largest expense for most of this country](http://money.cnn.com/2016/06/22/real_estate/rent-affordability-housing-harvard/index.html). What? Are you sharing a one bedroom with 5 other people? Rent alone will cost you 30-50% of a 120k salary, after taxes. > I'm tired of people who have no cold hard facts I see 0 cold, hard facts in your parroting post. Maybe you should try taking your own advice, and redoing that math before you start bitching about other people not doing what you yourself haven't done.
