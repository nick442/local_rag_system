Okay, regulations are neither good nor bad for a business but can be either. A regulation forcing people to buy burger king would be good for burger king. Regulation is a neutral term that has been appropriated by certain groups as a go to word to convince people in one direction or another. A regulation that brings maximum social benefit closer to maximum private benefit will help the economy as a whole. One such regulation is that a business cant sell you non functioning goods, knowm as a lemon law. Taxation is the same thing. A tax on something that people over consume can help the economy as a whole as it will encourage the shift of resources away from producing that thing and again bring MSB closer to MPB.
