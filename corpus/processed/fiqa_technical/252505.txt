There are mechanisms for determining how valuable a property is without resorting to artificial government valuations that can rise/drop in relation to the local economy. The most interesting I'm aware of is to force a sale of a property for X times the tax the person is paying. So for instance if I value my home/business property at 100K and the forced-sale-factor is 100x then I would pay at **least** 1k/year for taxes maybe a bit more just to be safe. This also solves the imminent domain issue. That is a bit science-fictiony though. In reality using an average of similar recent sales, while imperfect, is good enough. >Diversification is important in all kinds of investments. I agree but governments can always raise rates or cut services or borrow in hard times, in general the property values should track fairly closely other forms of economic activity.
