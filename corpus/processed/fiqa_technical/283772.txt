Yeah I guess those prices are ok, though we will get a heavier tobacco tax next year. The beer is cheap in supermarkets, but I have to add this is just your regular dutch beer brands (Heineken, Amstel, Hertog Jan, etc.) with 24 33CL bottles. In a cheap bar you pay around $3.50-4.50 for those brands though (not to mention clubs with sometimes prices of $15+ for a beer).
