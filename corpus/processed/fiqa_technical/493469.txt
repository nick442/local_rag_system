> Every Yelp businesses gets same Yelp treatment. This statement is untrue. I want people to see something fun. I live in LA and am on Yelp quite a bit. After having used Yelp for years, I needed to buy a particular couch. That got me into looking for interior designers, and I stumbled upon this wonderful person: http://www.yelp.com/biz/asd-interiors-burbank-2 Wow - one star. That's horrid. Why would I ever **20 filtered reviews**. Uh. Ok - let's see what happened here. *20 five star reviews, written at different dates and times by different people who are clearly not bots. The only non-filtered review is a one-star review.* Yelp is one of the most evil businesses I've ever seen, because they've so casually buried her. You could make a case for many of those 5 star reviews - they're all the only review the person has ever posted, etc. But I see a few in there from people with MANY reviews and MANY friends. Those aren't fake, and there's NO WAY you could have designed a filter to remove them automatically. Look at the review by Monica A. Tell me that a filter caught that review. Yelp, as a business, intentionally sinks small businesses if they don't agree to the shakedown. It's amazing to see it so clearly. Hope you enjoy the example.
