I work for an electronics distribution company as part of their Accounting team and I hate it. I love doing month-end/year-end stuff because it actually engages my mind, but I hate doing A/P and A/R data entry stuff for a good majority of the year. At this point, I feel like switching career paths to something more engaging or another career in the accounting field.
