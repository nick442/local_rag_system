It was the sole creditor we're trying to avoid here is what I meant to say, not the broker him/herself. The reason a firm might extend their debt would be to extend their credit into monetary value, in the scenario I just discussed, and it would more often be the more well known firms that would be the most likely to provide a Bond-Money Supply--Think IBM Bonds, Google Bonds, Cheese Board Collective Bonds, Tesla Motor Bonds, GE Bonds, etc. All these firms would find a way to apply their bond funds in a way that would expand their output and henceforth make repaying the bonds much more likely, just like a normal firm would today. The only difference is that in the mean time, that bond becomes a monetary commodity which people can trade for goods and services until it is repaid. Once repaid/neutralized, people can see that the bond is worth using and the demand for that bond as money will increase, just like how the demand for money will increase and that prompts a normal central bank to print more money. Which means, the firm is safe to take on stable debt again which people can reuse again. The major difference here is that we have a money supply that you can choose to participate in or not, and it is up to the consumers of that currency how the money supply flows, as opposed to a central authority. It does matter who's first in line to get the new money in any economy, and with multiple policies competing, power is less concentrated: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx16a72j__8
