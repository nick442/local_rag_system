That's the RFID readers. We're talking about the cards with the chip on the surface of them, kinda like a SIM card but on a credit card. So far, use is still contained pretty exclusively to Europe. Another European thing that I'd love to see in the US, why the hell in the 21st century the waiter/waitress has to take my CC back to the cashier station? Europe's had wireless card swipers/receipt printers for YEARS. Swipe the card, print the receipt, server goes away so you can put in your tip in privacy, and everyone goes home a little faster.
