The problem is not that someone wants to rent out a spare bedroom and make some extra money, but that investors are abusing airBnB platform in order to control sometimes 100s of units while claiming to use them all. This can lead to entire neighborhoods turning into tourist destinations without any real locals. While renting out a spare bedroom isn't that bad it is contributing to a growing problem where people are getting kicked out of their apartments to make room for a more profitable airBnB. Tourists don't work and don't start businesses. The current hotel model isn't great either due to giant corporations controlling the most of the market, but airBnB is a corporation just the same and is growing much faster.
