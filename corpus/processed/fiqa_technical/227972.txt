The principal of the loan itself isn't any sort of taxable event. There are, however, two taxable events here. First, cashing out your 401(k). That income wasn't originally taxed, so it will be now, as regular income. Plus, you're going to pay a 10% penalty, assuming you're under 59.5 years of age. Second, when the business pays you interest, that interest will be taxable. The principal is not taxable; that's not income, after all. You simply are getting back what's yours. The interest is taxable, as that is the actual income here.
