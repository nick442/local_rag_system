"My old place of business used to have a huge number of ridiculous meetings. Many of them were retreading old ground just because we all knew, deep down, that there was no way for us to break new ground in that bureaucratic hell. We had a ""Go/No Go"" meeting on a Sunday discussing whether or not we were going to go live with a new version of somesuch or another that was dependent on some other team having its shit together (spoilers: they didn't). The call, somehow, took over an hour. I played Half Life 2 the entire time."
