That would be great, I'm just skeptical that it's possible to make green energy cheaper than fossil fuels. I guess you could do this by subsidizing research on green energy, which is not a bad idea. >If you make conventional energy artificially expensive to nudge people towards renewables then you open the door to politicians gaining power by promising to reduce energy costs to the consumer via removing those taxes you're advocating for. This is actually a great criticism, but I don't see any better solution (unless we are going to create an alternative to state-capitalism).
