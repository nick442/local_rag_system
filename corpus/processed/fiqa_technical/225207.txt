The research was comparing grocery chains in Manhattan, who all would have similar costs, and WF was the second cheapest. It's not apples to apples if you're comparing prices at stores in locations that would have different costs of doing business. Of course things will be cheaper way out in the Bronx than in midtown Manhattan.
