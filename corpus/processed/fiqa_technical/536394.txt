I was a Math-Econ interdisciplinary for my undergrad, have completed my MS in Math Finance, and am currently studying for a Ph.D. in Finance. Verik's summary of the math required for a MS Math Finance program is accurate. I'd also want to emphasize practicing your programming skills in general; depending on the professor, they may prefer you work in MATLAB, Stata, SAS, C++, etc., so a basic understanding of programming is helpful. I can give you book suggestions for a few of these topics (for example, I'm fairly certain the Shreve books are the standard for Stochastic Calculus,) but it may not be much help if you're going to a program that is less quantitatively oriented. Feel free to message me any random questions you have.
