$8/hr is livable if both the parents work, $33,280/yr, that's a little more than 150% above the FPL for a family of 3 (assuming 1 kid). It's still ~125% if they are only able to work 30 hours a week ($24,960). It's not livable for a single parent but the prevalence of broken households is an entirely different matter.
