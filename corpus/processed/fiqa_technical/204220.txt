I agree but think it goes a lot deeper towards the issue of trust - something few brands seem to place much value on these days. Demographics, CTRs, ROIs - all the quantifiable numbers and metrics are more important than ever, in the minds of advertisers, with little value given to the trust and relationship between the channels and their respective audiences. Google is a great example of the commoditization of advertising spaces, making the assumption that all spaces are created equally. While this works for selling commodity widgets, there is an erosion of trust that takes place between a commodity audience and commodity content used to sell commodity advertising. By removing the sense of authority and respectability that brands would once gain from aligning themselves with specific audiences via specific channels, you turn the whole system into a numbers game which further perpetuates the problem. Itâ€™s also likely to only continue to get worse as everything increasingly becomes and advertising, product placement or promotional opportunity - so good on anyone that does not blindly and ignorantly take advertising at face value.
