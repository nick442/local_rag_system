"Why? I did comp sci and have an MBA. I also do EMT work as a volunteer in a rural community. Do my toes are in both pools. I would really question deeply the motives from moving to business from medicine. Despite the articles you see, an MBA is hardly the road to riches. Most do okay. Top tier grads are making very good money. These are also a small % of people out there working. Even those making good money sacrifice that for really shitty hours and shit work for a while until they break into the higher earning spots. The ""models and bottles"" is exaggerated to beg in with, and less and less common every year. When someone asks me about getting an MBA or finance I ask why. What us their real reason. If its money, don't do it. Do it because you actual ly love the business of business. I have traded stocks since I was 12. Its always been interesting. If I forced myself to do it for the money, I'd be poor and miserable. I am not rich. But I am comfortable and I live the life and schedule I want. None of that is from that slip of paper. The knowledge I could have (and did) get on my own. I trade the markets, do real estate, and have 1-3 entrepreneural projects at any given time. Its the life I created for myself. I found it was really the only way for me to get what I wanted. My goals never fit we all with institution goals. TL;DR- what's your motivation? Its probably a shitty move."
