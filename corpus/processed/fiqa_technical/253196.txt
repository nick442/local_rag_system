No time for random fights. I'm busy creating jobssssss. But snark aside. How do you fill the gap between what people require to survive and what they actually get. Clearly it's better for society as a whole that the indigent and poor be taken care of because the alternate is much more costly long term (for profit prison system yea!) I would posit that you aren't going to do that by raising minimum wage. It's not the long term course correction that we need. While you probably have a picture in your mind of me being hard right cheering during Fox news broadcasts that would be incorrect. I'm still pissed the DNC shafted Sanders during the primaries and we ended up with Trump as a direct result of their arrogance.
