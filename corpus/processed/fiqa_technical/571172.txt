> was it too hard for the server to catch the wings that obviously looked uncooked Servers almost never bring the food out at places like this. There is a person on the line that plates the food that was made and another person to bring out the order. Sometimes that second person is the server but most of the time it isn't. It does sound like you got bad service from the server though. I honestly don't know why servers exist at places like this. Just let me order from a terminal and have the person bring out the food.
