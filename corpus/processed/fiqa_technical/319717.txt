I remember going there with my friends when they had.. 15 or 20 cent wings (I think). This was something like 10 years ago. But we would eat a lot of wings, buy lots of drinks and end up spending a good amount of money. I went with my family a few months ago. Wings were 50 cents each (I think), one was raw in the middle, they barely covered the wings in sauce, some tasted old, they were smaller and thinner. I didn't order any other drinks, I tipped poorly because the food sucked (well, the service did too - was it too hard for the server to catch the wings that obviously looked uncooked and stop at our table more than once? Poor management as well I suppose), and won't be going back. So.. I guess the new thing is to blame Millenials (although, I'm Gen X) because they don't want to pay for poor quality, overpriced food. How dare they not support inferior business practices!
