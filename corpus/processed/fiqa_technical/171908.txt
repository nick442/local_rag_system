Same day shipping? If that's even possible, that would be pretty FUCKING awesome, but how would that work? Fedex and UPS ship on specific schedules every day. They would have to set up their own distribution service to ship out to specific spots. If I can get same-day shipping, I would definitely choose that over next-day or two-day shipping. Hopefully it costs somewhere around 6.99 per item w/ a Prime membership.
