Listening to the only Engineer's *Union* that I know of trying to argue for their union employees is novel, only because it's engineers. There is nothing fundamentally wrong with outsourcing, but it does have to be done right. Too often, project managers just see it as a cost savings without really understanding the proper methods and costs to do so. My guess is that, if you haven't done large-scale outsourcing before, you should expect the total might be more than doing it in-house. The benefit of outsourcing should be a better product and, eventually, a somewhat reduced total cost.
