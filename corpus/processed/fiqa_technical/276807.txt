"Not quite, while you have considered time efficiency you have forgotten material efficiency. Can you grow more potatoes in the same piece of land, can a single hen lay more eggs, can the bees give more wax. Here is a classic example of exploiting animals and nature. It may be hard for people in the first world to imagine exploiting humans the same way as we do animals. In the real world however a large section of the worlds human population has lower rights than wild animals in some of the developed parts. The reason for this is ""value system"" that is ""our"" value system. An animal in the forest is essentially worthless in our system because it earns no dollars or pays no taxes. If it is a rare or magnificent animal like a tiger, then it is valued more. Most people in the world lead primitive lives by our standards and do not deserve the lands that may have fed them for thousand generations. So by applying our value system we pay them peanuts as compensation for their land and grab it. Sadly most of the growth in the world is fueled by such resource/land grabs."
