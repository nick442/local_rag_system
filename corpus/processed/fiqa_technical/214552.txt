"In futures, once you have established your position, you will earn or lose money depending on what the underlying does. Theoretically, if you had no stop, you could lose far more than you invested. An option will slowly lose all its value if the stock does not rise (assume it is out of the money when purchased). Depending on the strike, it could rise substantially and you'd still lose all your money. But you can't lose more than you put in. So options have limited risk compared to futures, at the expense of a decaying ""time value"" that you will effectively be paying while holding the option."
