We can only print money until we start to see the effect in inflation, true, but we've got quite a way to go before that happens. Currently, t-bills are paying under .2% interest/year. Money can be borrowed at a historic low rate. No one worried about this huge amount of debt when Bush was running it up. Now that the deficit has actually gotten under control, people are up in arms. The government has always run a deficit, except once. Money is a closed loop. Household savings/spending + business savings/spending + imports/exports + government surplus/deficit = 0. That's an accounting identity. Currently, households are spending a bit, businesses are saving like nobodies business, and we export more than we import. We have to run a deficit to have an economy.
