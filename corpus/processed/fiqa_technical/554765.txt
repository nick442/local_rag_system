You're spot on for Whole Foods. This is a great step for them, and for Amazon. I've spoken with coworkers across my company that have been severely disappointed in the past with the Amazon grocery development. I see this as a easy way for Amazon to enter brick-and-mortar, compete in a more tangible way with other grocery chains, and still be Amazon. Ultimately, Whole Foods/Amazon does not equivocally mean better prices from farm marketers. Grain, pork, corn, beef, salt prices are going to if anything lower for farmers for larger profits as the marketers have not changed. Monsanto, ADM, Cargill, are still big players that are all in talks with to make this merger sustainable for Amazon and Whole Foods. That supply chain remains until Amazon moves into a rather deeper market.
