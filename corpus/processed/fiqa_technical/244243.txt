"What teachers have is not ridiculous. Stop blindly accepting what the media is throwing at you. What teachers have is the right to a due process when they are being evaluated. That's all. Why? Try this: the next time you assert pseudo free market principals into education, at least take into account the fact that (unlike a free market) schools cannot hire anybody to teach simply because you want to. Someone on Wall Street can hire literally anyone they want based simply on the idea that they're convinced the person can do the job. Not in education. The people demand that a teacher go through (literally) years of classes, observations, training, and tens of thousands of dollars to earn their credential. In other words, if you were a principal and you stumbled across somebody that you were convinced would make an excellent teacher, you couldn't hire them. There is no free market system in education because the people have demanded standards for what qualifies someone as a professional teacher. Here's the point: what kind of people would jump through all those hoops to become a teacher (or firefighter, or policeman) without something to protect what they've earned? We're already losing record number of teachers because of the bullshit that comes from letting politicians run our schools. Take away union protections and they'll be leaving in droves. What's fucking ridiculous is a public that wants ""no child left behind"" heroic performance at a fraction of what they paid forty years ago."
