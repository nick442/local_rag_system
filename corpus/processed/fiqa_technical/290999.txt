Hoping to get these questions answered by y’all, probably geared more towards someone who has experience with a retailer: When a store physically closes, does that effect business in that surrounding area? This is kind of a branding issue I guess. And/or do online sales noticeably decline in that area? I got curious from this because I’ve always noticed that L Brands (operates Victoria’s Secret & Bath and body Works) seems to be in many malls, even failing ones. I’ve since learned that this is actually their business model. But why? Would they have high rates of return if they were online? Increases in damages? (hard to resell shower gel and undies, even if you don’t know if they were used) Or for specialty retailers is it important to the brand that they have a physical location for brand recognition? Thanks to anyone for their time!
