Back in college I would go home every two weeks or so and meet up with my high school buddies for 30Â¢ wing night. Sure they weren't making a lot of the wings (if anything) but each of us would always drop at least $20-25 a person even if we only ate ~10 wings on average. Haven't been back since they switched to the variable wing pricing.
