Moronic question I'm sure. Listening to the Bloomberg Surveillance podcast and they mentioned that the vast majority of financial transactions in China and even North Korea are denominated in US dollars. They go on to say that this means they HAVE to go through US banks giving the US tremendous leverage. Can someone explain this whole idea to me. 1. Why do transactions done in US dollars have to go through US banks? 2. Does that leverage the US has just come from our ability to prevent transactions from occurring if they are run through our banks?
