"I lived in Europe for 18 years. I had better care there than in the US for what I paid. Also, under the current system, taxpayers pay more to the government for healthcare than in other countries which have universal healthcare. Additionally, those 46% who don't pay taxes either have shit jobs or can afford a good accountant. A janitor or other ""low skill, low level"" worker isn't going to pay taxes because he's not making enough. Recent college graduates cannot afford a all around healthcare insurance because they don't have the money. You live in an economic society where every class level is inter-dependent. Paying them shit and telling them the society as a whole shouldn't help them is very selfish and short term sighted."
