TAPE-RITE is a convertor of adhesive tapes. That means we buy tape in bulk rolls and then we cut it to size in our on premises shop. Because we do it all ourselves it gets done fast at competitive pricing with high quality. This means you don't need to order too much stuff too far in advance. We hold on to the inventory and produce it to your order. This allows you to free up capital and warehouse space for other uses.
