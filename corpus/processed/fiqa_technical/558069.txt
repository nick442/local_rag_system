"Wow, first off, I'd like to thank you for taking the time to type up that massive response. While I wasn't exactly asking for someone to ""LoLZ write my paper for me!"" I was hoping to get a better understanding of the economics segment for Dell. My understanding of the finance/economics is very mediocre, and was trying to figure out just how the current state of the economy was impacting Dell. I have definitely written up a lot about ""The Cloud"" as well as moving away from desktop machines. While I am in the IT industry, it definitely doesn't stimulate my economic knowledge :)"
