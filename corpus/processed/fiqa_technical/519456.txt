Thanks so much for the advice Kyrias. You're absolutely right that I need to keep nipping at the heels. But at this point, it feels he's less of a friend and more of a benefactor. I merely wanted some good, intelligent insight (from people such as yourself) on the situation who don't have a bias toward the situation. I feel the more advice I can get on this topic (I've tried to explain the situation as neutral as possible) the more aware I can be moving forward. Not looking for a solution, but rather possibilities of the cause of problem and/or hypothetical fixes. I do appreciate you taking the time Kyrias.
