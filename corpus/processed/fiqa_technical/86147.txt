">I'm playing devil's advocate mostly I should hope so, because it seems disingenuous to suggest that viewing ""tons of photos"" is equivalent to seeing and touching something in real life, particularly shoes or clothes. Also, say, for example, you go to your local shoe store and try on a pair of shoes. Your usual size is 9.5, so you try that on first. But it feels big, and a 9 fits you better. If you'd gone to Amazon without going to the store first, even though they offer free exchanges, you'd still have to deal with the costs of printing out a return label, boxing them up, going to the post office, waiting two days for them to arrive at Amazon, and waiting two days for the new pair. But going to the store first saved you that cost, and the store doesn't get any reward for it. I'm not condemning you or anyone else for doing this. But I would feel guilty about it, and I'm trying to explain why."
