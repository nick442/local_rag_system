Margin is when you borrow to buy stock. The margin % is the amount you can have borrowed over your own stock. There may also be some other considerations e.g. risk portfolio. Say you have 10,000. Your broker allows you buy on margin with a margin requirement of 100%. So You buy 18,000 of stock. You have 10k of your own and borrowed 8k to buy this. So you have 80% extra stock on margin. Say the stock has a downturn and loses 12% or so. Suddenly you have 16k stock value. But you still owe 8k. You are now at 100% margin. 8k is yours 8k is borrowed money. At this point if you drop anymore you are exceeding 100% margin and your broker may sell to ensure they get their 8k. The benefits of this are of course if the stock goes in your favor. 10% rise is 1,800 instead of 1,000.
