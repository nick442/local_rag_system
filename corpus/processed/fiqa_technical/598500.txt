We did it where I used to work. Take IT, as an example, where a developer's time was priced close the market prices. The company, though in a completely unrelated area, did have some conference rooms that could be rented and the price was the same internally externally. The good things about the system was that costs where adequately accounted for. Also, departments that might have been only cost centres actually could turn a profit by servicing internal customers.
