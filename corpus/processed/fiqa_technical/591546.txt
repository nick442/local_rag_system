"The goal is to understand the movements of the market as a whole and understand the fortunes of every investor in the S&P. As for why it isn't price-weighted, it is because price is a complely arbitrary notion, whereas market cap is at least ""real"" in some sense. Imagine Berkshire Hathaway vs Apple. In the S&P, Apple takes up about 75% more of the index because it's market cap is 796B, compared to 452B for Berkshire. This makes intuitive sense. Apple is ""worth"" 75% more, so it takes up that much more of the index. Now lets look at price. In a price weighted index of only those two stocks, Apple, with a stock price of 154.12 would take up .06% compared to Berkshire Hathaway at 99.94% due to its 274,740 stock price. The only difference is Apple has WAY more shares outstanding. Nothing of economic value (other than a bit of liquidity) is captured in a price-weighted index."
