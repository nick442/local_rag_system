"Because.. * It's a type of food you don't know how to make well * It's a type of food that's not time/cost efficient * You just want to get out of the house and have someone else do dishes, heh That being said, it's super easy to do good steaks at home on the cheap. Looking at that recipe, you could even do it in one pan on the stove, probably better than them and way cheaper. 1. Acquire salt, pepper, steak, butter, brown sugar, and bourbon 2. Heat pan till it's searing hot 3. Pat steaks completely dry, apply salt/pepper 4. Toss steaks in pan 5. Sear each side for about a minute 6. Toss a tablespoon or two of butter in pan 7. Spoon melted butter over steak, a couple minutes per side 8. If you have a thermometer, start checking the temp. If not, look up the old ""poke test"" 9. Pull steaks off just as they hit desired temp, place on a plate under tinfoil 10. Carefully pour a shot or two of bourbon into the pan, add a tablespoon or so of brown sugar, scrape all the stuff on the bottom off and mix it all up real well. Cook until it's sticky, like a glaze. 11. Coat steaks in the glaze 12. If you happen to have some baby carrots or broccoli, toss them in the pan with the glaze and a little more butter and salt. Whole process takes maybe 20 minutes from start to finish, less once you have it down pat."
