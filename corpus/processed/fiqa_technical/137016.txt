"I didn't have time to expand my reply from earlier to your comment, but please show me exactly what ""issues I don't understand"" and how I ""look like an idiot"". It's not very often I get called an idiot or that I don't understand something when the person directing those at me hasn't even made a comment addressing the issue this article discusses."
