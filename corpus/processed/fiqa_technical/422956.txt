"Yeah, I sent an email about it 9 months ago: ""I am interested in getting a plan for unlimited NYTimes.com access *without* a Smart Phone or Tablet app. Right now the only plans I see include either of those or both. I just wanted to express my consumer interest in such a plan, I hope you offer one in the future."" They replied: >Thank you for contacting NYTimes.com. >You are correct. We currently offer a web & smartphone subscription, a web & tablet app subscription and an all digital access subscription. We do not currently have a web only subscription. >We appreciate your feedback and have passed it along to the appropriate department. Please let us know if we can be of any further assistance to you."
