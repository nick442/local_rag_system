> you were referring to tax-deferred accounts and I was referring to Roths. Okay, so you've admitted mistake \#1. We're making progress.. > So paying the tax as regular income RATHER than LTCG tax is not a concern. Ah! You're an autist, we're getting somewhere here! > Well, those are the only alternatives to a tax-deferred account, so.. Which is the *only* thing either I or TFA mentioned. But hey, we haven't thrown SPIAs into the mix yet, do you have a totally off-topic opinion on them you'd like to air? > No it doesn't. I honestly have no snappy comeback to this one. I *can*, however, give you some advice that you'll find useful throughout your adult life - When you make a mistake, the sooner you admit it, the better. No one will think less of you for making a simple error; when you double-down for three+ rounds.. And I'm pretty comfortable *I'm* not the one doubling-down, merely calling, here.
