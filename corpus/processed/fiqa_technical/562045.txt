"A good place to start is to read, such as : Robert T. Kiyosaki : poor dad rich dad. It is quite simple but it gives the good mindset to start. But moreover it is stated in the book : ""the best investement you can make is educate yourself"". You current situation is quite difficcult, but don't give up on your study. From your post i didn't understand : do you have a master degree? If you love math, learn coding and find a job in banking or else. People that know how to code AND have a good level in math worth a lot."
