Ask your bank to recall the transfer (as if went to wrong account and you have inform the bank about it). Secondly get a police report in the country where you sent the money from and where it was sent to, and state the person's name and account details. Ethically this person should return the funding, but if he or she wants to play gangsters paradise, then you want to take police action and push your bank to take the funds back by RECALLING THE FUNDS UNDER INDEMNITY. Ask your bank to give you a copy of the message they have sent to the beneficiary's bank. Use this wording and you will have success. Contact the beneficiary bank also and give them details.
