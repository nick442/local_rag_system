"My sister, who is in her mid twenties and not the most financially responsible kept telling me that the bank was doing ""weird shit"". I looked at her statements and noticed something else wells fargo does. She has a checking account that has a ten or fifteen dollar monthly fee. If her account ever got near that number or in the negative that is when that fee would be charged. So basically instead of charging that fee at the same time every month they would wait till that charge would cause an overdraft which would spark a $35 dollar fee. Yes I also proved that they are still reordering. I told her to save all her receipts for one month. Her account was at $50. She made a five dollar food purchase, and several other small purchases and then had to pay a small bill that took her over. Via the receipts it was easy to see that all the other small purchases were done two to three days ahead of the one that actually over drafted her. Which cost her almost $200 in overdraft fees. She is actually not that bad with money, she works 40 hours a week but she just does not make enough to live on and this kind of practice puts her in a hole over and over again."
