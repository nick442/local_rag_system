This is horse-trading, *not business*. But if Person 2 has an offer for 38K, then the item is sold, and he's not even talking to you. But if he IS talking to you, and he has a deal with the 38K man, and you offer 39K, and he accepts, that is known as gazumping; backing out of an agreed sale for a higher offer. Given that a verbal agreement is legally binding - gazumping is illegal. BUT! Sale price is always dependent on two things; a willing seller and a willing buyer. Without these two things, no sale can take place. And price is immaterial unless one of the parties is mentally deficient; if both parties agree to a sale price, then a valid sale can take place. People place different values on things, and that is why an item can sell, and both parties can be happy! You might have been happy to pay 40K for the item, and consider 39 a bargain. The seller might only have wanted 35, but wanted to see how high he could push you, to try to find out what YOUR highest possible price is for the item. If you are actually in business, then trading on lies is a recipe for failure. Uber is a great example of company founded on lies, which exploits morons, and which operates illegally in every location. Uber will never succeed, because it does not operate in a truthful, transparent, or legal manner. Practicing lying in business is a great way to get a bad reputation really quickly. And in many instances, lying will be breaking the law. Lying about warranties, materials, things like that.
