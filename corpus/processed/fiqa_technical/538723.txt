"Matt Levine: >Also, though, I found it hard to imagine that those Equifax executives were consciously insider trading. It would just be too dumb. Equifax's press release reporting the breach says that it ""discovered the unauthorized access on July 29 of this year and acted immediately to stop the intrusion,"" though it didn't announce it until yesterday because it was still investigating. The three executives filed Form 4s reporting sales on Aug. 1 and 2, days after the discovery. You could just about imagine them learning of the security breach, panicking, and selling everything -- except that they didn't sell everything. One sold about 4 percent of his stock holdings, another about 9 percent, another about 13 percent. Why do such comically obvious insider trading if you're only selling a small percentage of your stock? And indeed the company explained that these executives ""had no knowledge that an intrusion had occurred at the time."" I guess the time between ""tech person discovers a security breach"" and ""top executives discover it's a huge embarrassing crisis"" is more than a couple of days. https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-09-08/data-breaches-and-last-looks"
