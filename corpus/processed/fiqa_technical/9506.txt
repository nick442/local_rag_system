Network theory to the rescue. Imitate the [PageRank algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank): to have a good rank you need to have a link with every other people who also have a good rank. This means the obvious: you need to network with your banker and with the maximum of people who have high-rank links with him (bosses, friends, coworkers). This will maximize the chances of your discovery (like searching for a node in a [graph](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory)).
