The basic theory is that if the price goes up, demand for the product will go down. The ancillary benefit is a public health one: less diabetes and health related issues from over consumption of sugars which leads to lower costs of health care for people who end up consuming less sugar and the overall population - this reduces insurance rates and so on and so forth. That is the theory.
