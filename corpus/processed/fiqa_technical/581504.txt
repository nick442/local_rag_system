FFTs target people who make frequent, large transactions. It would primarily affect people like day traders, high frequency traders. If you're doing either of those things with your 401(k), I think you have other problems. Oh, it'll also affect people transferring extremely large amounts of money (like billions), which again, if you have in your 401(k), you have other problems.
