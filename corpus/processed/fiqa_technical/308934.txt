Honestly, I think what matters a lot more to investors is that there isn't a bifurcated congress & white house. They care a lot more about being able to actually get behind one plan (i.e. not going off the fiscal cliff) than who actually wins. The president has surprisingly less power than people think when it comes to managing the economy. Think about this in today's environment, who has more control over the stock market: Obama or Bernanke? That should be nothing short of a toss-up.
