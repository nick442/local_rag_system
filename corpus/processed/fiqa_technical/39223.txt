It's a good idea to have some emergency money so I would propose a plan that keeps some in your savings: If the 0% goes away, then consider paying it off, but by that time hopefully you have built up your savings a bit more. Also consider the ability to move the balance from the 2% cards to the 0% one, if that is possible.
