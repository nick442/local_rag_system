WTF? Americans aren't saving enough for retirement as it is, SS is not going to be a viable way to fund retirement, and now they want to make it *harder* to put money away for retirement? We're getting pushed into a world where no one can retire but the job market is shrinking due to automation. Want the American Revolution 2.0 with pitchforks and torches? Because this is how you get the American Revolution 2.0 with pitchforks and torches.
