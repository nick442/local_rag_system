I don't see the connection between the investment capital and the income you receive from it, and why one part should be free from taxation just because the other was taxed. I mean with that logic everything I do with my after-tax money is hopefully providing me some form of anticipated benefit, so I guess I shouldn't have to pay taxes on any part of my income that i spend or put at risk.. why is making a capital investment any different in this regard than paying for education, buying a tangible asset (like a home), buying food to keep me alive so i can continue to work, etc? Basically, you're going to have to explain why that makes sense to you.
