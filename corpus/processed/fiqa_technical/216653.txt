Your argument is correct. However, from a personal experience, the last 10 or so times that I have ordered Dominoes is because it's a lazy Sunday mid morning and they have my order preferences and credit card stored so ordering takes a minute or less. Basically with the online channel they have created a method of promoting impulse buying amongst customers who's orders don't change.
