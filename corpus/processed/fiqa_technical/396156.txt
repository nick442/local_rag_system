Actually I found companies hire based on experience, if you jump around you have more experience even if your work is average. Companies pay what the job is worth now, i.e. market rate - why pay more. Thus the real issue is many employees are not moving up with out moving out. But you can look at it as people are mediocre (less than average) which would be true ~50% of the time.
