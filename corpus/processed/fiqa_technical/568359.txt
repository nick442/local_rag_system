"Yup, and circa 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006 and even 2007.. The people who had claimed there was a ""housing bubble"" were laughed at as well (remember all of those assurances that there was NO BUBBLE, and that housing prices were based on ""solid fundamentals""). I recall a few years back when I said the Fed would end up blatantly buying Treasuries -- I was told that was ""unprecedented"" and that ""no way"", etc, etc. Fast forward a bit and the Fed is now the MAJORITY buyer (really there is no market for Treasuries *other* than the Fed, and if the Fed were not buying, then it would be hugely different). But, let's ignore all that and just call for the bartender to serve another round ""on the house""!"
