But how do I bring the initial deposit into the equation? Basically, you can't. Unless you combine two different formulas from Math of Finance into a single expression. The single initial deposit of $1000 will compound for 20 years at 5% compounded annually. The final amount for this part of the deposit will be: V1 = 1000 x (1.05)^20 In addition the series of 20 payments will be an ordinary annuity with a regular payment of $100, with the value on the occasion of the 20th payment given by: So the final total amount in the account at the end of 20 years will be the sum of these two values..
