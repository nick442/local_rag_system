"Oracle is the most prevalent software in the Banking and financial system, if not in the front end then on the back end. Oracle has made so much profit for the financial sector that they ended up acquiring SUN systems and now bundle their own hardware along with their software and databases. There is perhaps not a single bank in the world that does not use oracle in some form or another, be it AML, MIS, ERP or Core banking. It remains a mystery to me how the Heads of Banking and the Fed can sit in front of the senate banking committee and when asked "" What is your exposure?"" Their response was ""I don't know!"" Bankers are dumb by their very nature and cultivated to look the other way, but even for them and their corrupt single digit IQ, I think Oracle must really suck as a database if they could not run a simple sum query. Conclusion : Oracle colluded in the 2007 financial crisis and sucks as a database and financial system"
