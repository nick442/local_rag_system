I'm a democrat so get off your midget-horse. If there are no jobs in your city, yes you should move. I did and as did all 3 of my siblings. Pretty much every single person I went to college with moved from their hometown as well to pursue a better paycheck. Moving for work has always been an integral part of the American psyche, it's literally how your state was founded and what separated us from Europeans in the 19th and early 20th centuries. What do you want to have happen? You want the federal government to force companies to move to your home state? You want to pay a bunch of corporate welfare to entice a company to move for you? If anything you should be pissed that your state government has created such a toxic environment that no one wants to open a business there besides those looking to exploit your natural resources. Your economy sucks because of your local politics - almost everywhere else is doing well as far as employment goes. There should be wage increases happening right now that aren't but if we don't go into recession they will go up soon. They are going to have to. But only in those places with diverse economies built on future tech energy models. Don't get mad at me, get mad at yourself and those around you. You all have voted for republicans who have dicked you over for decades yet it's always someone else's fault. I understand you're a democrat personally so you of all people should understand this.
