As someone with a friend who received a cease and desist from Lego over a niche lego related product very similar to what is described, I seriously doubt that Lego has changed their notoriously litigous stance. In fact, they've tried to sue people who made products compatible with lego before and failed in court. This article is probably just spinning an awareness that they don't have a legal leg to stand on into a benevolent attitude.
