I see no humor at all, only disgust. People are being burned, just not at the stake. I see it more like decades of financiers leveraging his daddy's assets for him through multiple failures with con jobs, mob money, money laundering and government welfare. 95% of the population are more qualified to be president just because they are not a nut job. Playboy Chump is a nut job, an idiot, a fraud, a snake oil salesman and a garden variety asshole. Proof that democracy has failed at the hands of the powers that be.
