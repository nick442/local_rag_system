"I swear to fucking [Deer-Jesus](http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=3281) that the government just makes up these ridiculous numbers to hide the cost of secret programs. There is no fucking way the government is sitting in a meeting and actually come to an agreement that ""Hey yea, 400 billion dollars *is* the right amount of money to spend on this one plane."" Unless that was followed up by ""..wait billion, I thought you said million.. fuck it. too late now."""
