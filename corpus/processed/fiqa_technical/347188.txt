"Saying that sales go online doesn't mean that a typical JC Penny shopper just goes to their site. These people are going to google, shopping engines and Amazon. ""Upping your online sales"" isn't that simple. If the majority of shoppers are searching google and your listings don't show up, then that potential customer is going else where. You could pay for PPC ads but return on investment on PPC can suck depending on your market and for products that have a long life cycle return happy customers could be years before they return. Even worse, if JC Penny and Sears DID want to compete online their prices aren't really all that great either, so even if you landed on their site, chances are you can find it cheaper else where, and their overhead (from stores, and employees) makes it hard to cut prices to compete."
