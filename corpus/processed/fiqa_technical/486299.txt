Supply and demand. The market needs highly competent software engineers, and will pay out the nose for them. It needs liberal arts majors too, but there are a lot more of them out there, so wages are lower. Oddly enough, it seems more of the liberal arts majors - and I was one of them once - have developed a pretty strong sense of entitlement, and get pissy when they don't see the same kinds of incomes and perks as the guys with the more marketable skills. Cue OWS!
