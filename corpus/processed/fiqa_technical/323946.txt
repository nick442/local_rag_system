First the obvious: Business school rankings are flawed. I have no doubt that Asian business schools are improving rapidly, and many are already on par with Western universities. Many of the best teachers at US/European schools are also teaching in Asia (I have never had an Asian teacher but I expect that they are as great as their Western counterparts). Also, academic journals accept more and more Asian submissions. But we also have to put the numbers in perspective. An American student who did an MBA in China will have a hard time getting a job in the US. Even those who go to European universities are met by recruiters with puzzlement. So these the high ranking of Asian schools is really only relevant for Asian students. In short, what the ranking says is: If you're Chinese, you don't *need* to go to the US or Europe for your business degree. Personally I suggest you still do if you can afford it, because the experience abroad, and the exposure to students with a different attitude, will be an enrichment.
