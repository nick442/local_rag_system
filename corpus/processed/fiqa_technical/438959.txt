Lol. Americas are two continents. How many times do I have to educate you? America itself is not a country. Beside that you still have not presented any data. All your points have been invalidated and best you can do is change topics over and over. If you think that 1-3 percent tarrif is protectionism, you clearly don't know anything. This is especially true if you think Russia is a model where we should be. Lol. Ur so understanding is so bad, I am confident it's more than just cognitive dissonance Still could not address my points about Argentina, Canada, US and etc. It is pretty clear you are uneducated and will never get this. Edit Btw love your fake data and facts. I guess that's how you get cucked so hard to begin with EDIT2 **LOL. Chart says tarrif of 10 big countries. Not 10 highest Tarrif. LOLOLOL.** IS your cognitive dissonance this strong? Or are you having such a hard time following this? I feel for you if you cant even keep up on this. Best to stay in your safe space and keep getting cucked. >Why do Liberals always use homophobic insults? That's something I noticed this election cycle, the most LGBT friendly people always call people they don't like gay. All these dick sucking jokes. People saying Republicans suck on penises. I wasn't being homophobic. I called you for what you are. That's your choice. No shame. Keep doing what you do and be Putins whatever.
