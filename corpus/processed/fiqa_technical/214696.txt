I want to eliminate government schools because it's not a proper function of government. The government's role is to protect individual rights, not to provide crappy overpriced services that can't be opted out of. Similarly, the government shouldn't be involved in healthcare for the same reasons. Remember, even before Obamacare, the government spent over half of all healthcare dollars, and tightly regulated the rest. What we are seeing now is government run medicine.
