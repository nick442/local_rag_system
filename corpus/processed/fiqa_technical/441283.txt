I get exactly what you mean and I agree, but that reality of it is that that's not always possible. I have friends who are just barely able to pay rent and have to use the rest of their income to eat bread and butter for every meal. They work full-time and has two jobs (at one point he had three just to stay afloat after getting injured on his way to work), and he's not able to save up anything and even when he tracks his balances, he teeters on the fine edge of being evicted for not paying rent, starving to pay bills, or overdrafting.
