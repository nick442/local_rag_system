All of the people you witch hunt on Reddit are doing so *organically* ha!, whereas you are admittedly a paid propagandist/activist. Many of them have higher education than you, and all of them have as much backing by the scientific community in general as anthropogenic climate change, or efficacy and safety of vaccines. Nearly all of the anti GMO bullshit you work hard to spread on the internet is the product of charlatans or charlatans financially benefit from it. You support health and diet woo industries that dwarf any seed companies in total income, and contribute to the continued suffering of millions of people.
