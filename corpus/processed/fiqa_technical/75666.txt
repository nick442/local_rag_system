These are designed to be peripherals around your home to help you with little things like play music, set timer/alarms, give you morning briefings, turn on tv & switch to a specific channel, turn off lights, etc. These are some of the things I use them for everyday and over time they add up. I find them super convenient. You are right that the mic is on all the time but it's on to be able to listen to the wake word so that it can respond to your requests. When it is not hearing the wake word, it does not send anything back to the server. In the case of Amazon Echo, when the blue ring comes on it is when Alexa sends your voice back to the server for processing.
