Well that depends on how far down it goes. If someone calls for a 75% decline in the market next year, and instead it happens in 3 years, well it's still a good call in my books. If you listend and moved your money out of the market until that 75% fall hit, then invested in the market as it was very low, you'd be looking at an overall return of at least ~30% as the market rebounded which is decent for a 4 year return. On the other hand if the market rose up 60% over 3 years, then fell 25%, the return on sitting on the sidelines wouldn't be worth it. **EDIT** Appreciate any comments onto why I was downvoted. When I'm wrong I like to learn why!
