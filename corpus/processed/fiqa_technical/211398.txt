>It was a way to associate an ad with a user’s page without putting it directly on the page, which advertisers worried would imply an association between their brand and the page’s content. bullshit. It was a way to get noticed. besides we had banner ads before that and often hilariously unrelated to the page it was on. not one associated it, they simply poked fun.
