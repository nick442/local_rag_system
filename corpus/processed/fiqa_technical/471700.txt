If corporations are people, why do persons have to pay tax on their revenues (personal income) while corporations only pay tax on their profits (operating income). If corporations are people, then everyone should pay taxes the same way - either on their revenues, or their profits. We shouldn't be discriminating. Boy, if a person could only pay taxes on their profits (savings), instead of their revenues (personal income), it'd be a whole new ballgame.
