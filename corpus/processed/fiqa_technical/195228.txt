Yeah if you didn't notice - you can't buy cigarettes and heroin with food stamps. They take the food we give them and they choose to trade it. That's the choice they made - we gave them food to eat, they chose not to eat it and smoke cigarettes and do drugs. They made a poor choice. Poor people don't get freedom?
