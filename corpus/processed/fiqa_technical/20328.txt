"You should definitely read through that contract front to back multiple times, making sure you understand every word. Voice your concern to the gym. Explain why you feel you're being cheated. Best case: they waive the fee. Worse case: you leave bad reviews all over social media, explaining the ""surprise fee"" practice, and *then* they waive the fee. Very worst case: The gym refuses to waive the fee, you threaten legal action. They're probably going to waive the fee then. I don't forsee any circumstance where you actually have to take them to court. I'd ask /r/legaladvice for sure."
