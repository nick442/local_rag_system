They will pay, that's for sure. It's something common in many countries. Sometimes it is stolen money like Philipp said. Sometimes is money from mafia or terrorist groups that needs to be transferred so they use naive people whose profile wouldn't be suspicious if they get sums of money. They will look your past transactions to determine the amount of money they could transfer to you without alerting someone. Why? Because lets say you are a criminal. If you sell 10 kilos of cocaine, some bombs or girls for prostitution and receive the money lets say one million dollars in just one deposit in one bank account, someone will be knocking at your door very soon, it will be easy to prove the illegal source of the founds and you get nothing. If you have 25 guys working for you and they receive transfers and deposits of less amount frequently, from let's say 150 different accounts belonging to account holders with no criminal record. It is harder to be noticed and you could say they are legal activities (15000 a month received from entrepreneurs or 2500 from a housewife is not too much). It will be harder to prove that all the transactions come from illegal money and by the time it is proven usually the money has already gone somewhere else (by using another network of mules like your friend's). I don't know the laws where you are, but this is illegal in many countries. If you enter they won't let you out of the network, and when something goes wrong you will need to explain a lot.
