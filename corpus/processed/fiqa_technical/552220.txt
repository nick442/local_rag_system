"Thanks. This is super simplified as I said. It gets much deeper when you start looking at costs of capital, country risk premiums (for projects in emerging markets), ""risk free rate of return"" (putting cash in guaranteed returns such as a us treasury note), mutually exclusive projects, etc. But the basic concept is.. what is the minimum required return on a project to justify choosing to pursue it. If you borrow money via loan at 10%, your required rate of return on whatever project you invest it in has to be at least that 10%. Otherwise you're better off just not doing anything."
