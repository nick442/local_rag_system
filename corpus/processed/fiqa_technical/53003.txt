> That power is going to shift to Europe and East Asia where education isn't treated as a commodity. In those countries, not everyone gets into college. So for those that do, the degree is worth something. The concept of blocking a child from going to college because their grades are just average, is foreign to US culture. Then these average students get a mountain of debt, and a degree that won't take them anywhere. As a foreigner in the US, it feels cruel to me. But in my country, only the top 30-40% of high school students academically can gain entry to college. All others must look for a different path (community college, trades, etc).
