I can see the point of it but you also have to remember what kind of people are working here to begin with, they are often people with a high school education or equivalent with no additional training or education. That doesn't leave a lot of jobs open and pretty much regardless of where they work the market wage is going to be low because they are extremely interchangeable. That is to say this is the working poor, the people that the government targets quite a bit so they'll have a negative external impact on the rest of the economy as a whole. So while it does cost you money per year really the more important question is if these people were employed elsewhere, or not employed, what would the cost be and if there is any difference to where the government is paying more then they should be taxed by that amount to pay for the externality.
