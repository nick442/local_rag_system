Sure. PM me a dropbox link or something or your e-mail address and we can connect that way. Biggest piece of advice, get on the phone and just call call call. Have a pitch ready that's clean and clear and don't be afraid of no. This is the time for you to learn how to call and sell, cuz that's what it's probably going to take in today's market. Differentiate yourself. No other new graduates are calling business leaders.. maybe that's why you deserve the job.
