Calling banks 'evil' seems sensationalist. I think it's better to say that their reward-punishment tradeoff is skewed very heavily partly driven by governments being held hostage to fear of bank runs and other doomsday scenarios. Also, if you think about it, finance has never ever been a clean industry (and I say this as someone whose entire career has been in this industry). Every culture that I know anything about has had issues with the ethics of money lenders throughout history (Middle East, Med. Europe, China, India).
