"Moral capitalism only makes sense when everyone agrees on the definition of that phrase. Whatever you decide is moral, there will be someone that thinks it's not. ""We should see taxes as an integral part of a moral capitalist economy, providing health, education and social care outside the market."" Taxes are a part of every government, capitalist or otherwise, that I know of. The real question becomes, ""How much health, education and social care is it the government's responsibility to provide?"" or, to put it another way, ""What should I get for free at the expense of everyone else if I choose not to work?"" It's a balancing act: We generally want to support those who cannot support themselves (even when it doesn't make sense, evolutionarily speaking) but we don't want to create a disincentive for people to learn, grow, work and better themselves. We don't want it to be easier or more comfortable for able people to collect government checks instead of earning their own."
