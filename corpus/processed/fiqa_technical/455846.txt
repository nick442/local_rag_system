"Retired at 27, I have been travelling for some time now and am looking to get back to working on a major project.. whatever that might be. ""Idle hands are the devils tools"" or something like it. This has been my philosophy: I plan to work till the day I die, but the hell if I will have to! Having financial stability totally kills motivation, I feel that every day. Sometimes I just want to blow half the money I worked for just for a reason to work for it again. Maybe thats the trick? Blow enough to bring your retirement down to age 50 again, then start hustling it back up. Unless of course you didn't 'make' the money in the first place. Then I guess you'll just have to find a hobby."
