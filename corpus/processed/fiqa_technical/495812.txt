"what the hell is ""fair inequality""? In order for inequality to be justified, there needs to be constant growth in the economy such that the ones pulling away and getting rich are producing better products, services, or inventing more efficient ways to bring products to market. Unfortunately, more of the rich are turning to rent-seeking methods to increase their wealth, thus it becomes zero sum at that point because they are taking more wealth for themselves without actually adding any value, economically, to society. Currently our growth is anemic yet the very wealthy keeps pulling farther and farther away from the pack as far as total wealth. This is why as they get richer, the rest of us are getting poorer."
