This is complicated but I think I know what you mean. I guess it would depend on how the UK would be broken down into states. I mean we have states the vary in population from Wyoming to California. But the article the OP is referring to was written in response to income inequality in the UK. So I guess the fact that depending on how we break the UK down it could rank high or low makes the authors point, there is also a lot of income inequality in the UK.
