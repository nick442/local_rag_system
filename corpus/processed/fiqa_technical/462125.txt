#2 is really important. Western tourists hate getting assaulted by a bunch of shouting people who are all trying to get their attention and sell them something. It's really stressful. You just need to be calm, quiet, smile, make eye contact, and speak in normal English to get attention. Some distinctive/visible clothes/hat/trademark accessory could be helpful just to make you stand out a bit and be memorable. I would get a tshirt printed with the front explaining your services/prices to major destinations and the back with important info that can be read while driving.
