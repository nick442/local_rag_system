This is no big deal, IMO. The only real advantage is that I can think of is that if oil is priced in your currency then you're not subject to foreign currency fluctuations dictating your energy costs. In the short term USD has been falling. If this trend continues and oil switches to yuan, then our energy will become more expensive.
