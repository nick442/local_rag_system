You can't write exempt because according to the instructions on the W-4 I claim exemption from withholding for 2015, and I certify that I meet both of the following conditions for exemption. You don't meet the second condition. But you can increase the number of allowance to reduce the amount of taxes. Just make sure you put enough money aside into a savings account so that you can pay the taxes in the spring.
