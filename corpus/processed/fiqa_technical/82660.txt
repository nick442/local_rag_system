No appologies needed. The want to pretend this whole process is complicated so people like you don't ask questions, but that's really it. There's nothing more to it than that. They purchase bonds and other financial assets from the government and from their favorite banker friends with the money they just created (presumably by pushing the up arrow on a Dell keyboard, lol). That's it. Then the major banks and the government all have more money. The idea being that it loosens up credit. Those banks will lend out more money to other banks and eventually to us. Additionally, the government will have more money to spend. It gives the illusion that something of worth was actually created. That's the entire scheme. You still may have $1000 dollars, but your $1000 is now a smaller percentage of the total amount of money out there, so it buys less as prices increase to adjust for this new money.
