"Just to really drive home how wrong you are, let's review both: **Government** - you get 1 single binary choice every 2, 4 or 6 years not on an actual decision but for another PERSON to make the choices for you, without your input from then on, without any liability. If they lie to win their election, there's nothing you can do. There was no contract. You get no refund. They have control over the 1/3 of your income that taxation gives them. The most control you get is to wait those 730-2,191 days and get an *exchange* in the person who then gets to control your money and your choices. Voting in this system doesn't give you any control, it merely gives another person 1,000,000s of times as much control as everyone else. They are lawyers who won basically a popularity contest to gain control of $Trillions of our money. **""Horrible"" corporation** - the only provider of a service, sets the prices they want. You want the service, there's no doubt about it, but you want to pay less and get better quality. They'd *love* to be able to force you to pay for their service even if you don't want it, but they cannot. Soon enough, because of the high profits of the corporation, a new competitor arises, such as Verizon, Time Warner, or Google fiber and prices start dropping and quality goes up. All companies wish they were governments, where they could just force people with guns and threats of imprisonment to make them pay for their bloated services. Notice how the closer a company appears like a monopoly, the more it resembles the largest monopoly? Compare how similar the long lines at Walmart resemble the long lines at the post office or DMV?"
