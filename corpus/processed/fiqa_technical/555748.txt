There are a lot of issues: 1. Healthcare is dominated by monopolies and oligopolies. Giving decision making power to individual consumers isn't going to change that. Breaking them up is necessary. 2. Most pharmaceutical research is carried out with tax dollars. Then it is handed over to individual corporations to charge whatever they want. My wife was on a cancer drug. It was developed by a professor at a University with a government grant. The government paid for the testing, and when it was found to be effective, further testing was waved. Unfortunately, a pharmaceutical company had already patented the compound, without having any idea what it could do, so they got it. With no cost other than running a program that spit out compounds. They then charged $14,000 per month for the drug. 3. The consumer is at a serious disadvantage when it comes to knowledge in bargaining. Indeed in many cases the patient is unconscious when the decisions are being made.
