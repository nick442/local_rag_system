The reason there should really be no bad feelings for the bond-holders is that they knew full well that these were defaulted bonds, but bought them because they saw a loophole they could use to try and force Argentina's hand. It was basically a setup to enable them to try and blackmail the government into 'undefaylting' on those bonds. I recon what will happen in the end is that the other creditors, the ones who had accepted the haircut, will end up buying those bonds at close to full price, just to ensure they are paid at least part of their money back. Because around 95% of bond holders agreed to the haircut, the diluted costs would be small. What is infuriating is the precedent these guys are setting. In the end, all bond will have class-action clauses in which a majority agreeing to a restructure will apply to all bond holders.
