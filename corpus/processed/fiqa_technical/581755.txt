"Some people are better drivers than others. A collision can happen to anybody, even good drivers. The collision might not be your fault at all; it might be entirely the fault of the other party. However, the best drivers do a better job of avoiding collisions in situations where the other drivers on the road are doing the wrong things. The ""no claims discount"" is a way to identify and reward those good drivers, as they have a lower likelihood of claims in the future."
