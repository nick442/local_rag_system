Minimum wage is not supposed to be a living wage. Working at mcdonalds or a movie theater or a car wash aren't careers. You don't live off of unskilled hourly jobs. And you certainly don't have a family if you can't afford it, so no, minimum wage shouldn't afford to pay for a 2 bedroom. It's unbelievable that you think someone should be able to support a family off of 40 hour weeks at mcdonalds. The rich lawyers and businessmen who make millions a year aren't working 40 hour weeks (granted their time is much more valuable so their 40 hour week probably would bring in a decent amount of money) but no they work 80+ hour weeks.
