"Bring resume copies, a pen, and a leather case (if possible). Hold it in your left hand, you'll be shaking hands with your right. Keep a tissue in your right pocket to keep your hand dry. Don't take off your suit jacket, even if asked. You will be sweaty. Ask for water from the secretary or admin at the front desk. Keep this water with you in the interview. If you need time to think, nervous, or just don't know what to do with your hands, hold the cup or sip. (I love this advice I was given. It's weird how it changes you to have something to hold.) Stand when people enter the room to shake your hand. Ask questions! Ask ""what does day 30 and day 90 look like?"". I'm not sure the internship works, but I'm sure you want to know where you are in a month, and a quarter or so later. Know your hometown or college's trivia. What it is known for. It's like clockwork that I've had the person come into the interview and say to me ""so you're from _____, those ______'s are looking good this year"". Just be prepared to say ""yup, I love going to the games , but don't follow as closely now"". Or anything. That statement will happen. Are you clean cut, able to hold a conversation, and inquisitive? That's all they want to know. At this level, they just want to make sure you don't embarrass the person hiring you. Good luck!"
