"> I'm not sure there will ever be some moment in my life where a person walks up and asks me to install a cybernetic arm and I have to debate the merits. They will develop alongside the culture like most innovations. There'll be a moment when you see an advertisement for a cybernetic arm and you think ""nah, too flimsy, too expensive, too many problems."" Then there'll be a moment, years later, when you talk to a co-worker who got one and you think ""too expensive, not enough features."" Then there'll be this bit, years later, where your friend shows his new arm off to you and you think ""hmm, if only it had X and Y."" And then, years later, there'll be a point where you go and get a cybernetic arm."
