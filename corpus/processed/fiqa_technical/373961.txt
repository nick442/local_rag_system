I don't know why this is news, it's been possible for quite a while. A layer 7 firewall which filters certain types of traffic going outbound from the wireless guest network. A block page upon filtering that contains approved links for which the user can shop. A DNS proxy or even just the DHCP option to point the wireless network at the internal DNS of the store would point any name that the store wanted at its own domains. The average user doesn't know enough to not accept that infamous security warning indicating a non-matching certificate to domain name matching. And that only assumes the user goes to an https connection. If the company really wants to release themselves of any responsibility or liability, to get on the network they could require the user to accept and acceptable use policy which states, among other things, use of the wifi is at the sole discretion of the store as they are providing a free service. Really not hard.
