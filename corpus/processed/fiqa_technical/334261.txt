I think 3,000 shares would swallow up the sizes on the ask to bring it up to 25 right now just looking at level 2 quotes. But then you'll attract some sellers to bring it down right after I'm sure. edit: You just have to swallow up the offers out there. But a big move in price and people/marketmakers will likely see it as an opportunity to take advantage of a market move based on just one buyer and start selling and bringing the price back down.
