"Revisiting the topic one month later.. If we look at [Table A-8](http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t08.htm) again, ""Part time for noneconomic reasons"" declined by 218K, going from 19,880K to 19,662K. ""Part time for economic reasons"" has a slight decline of 33K, going from 7,544K to 7,511K. So that's a drop of 251K in part-time employment for July. Probably just noise."
