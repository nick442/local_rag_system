They did, but Google also owns a significant portion of Uber - they put in $258 million for 6.8% of the company at a $3.7 billion valuation (probably somewhat diluted by now), so Google's investment is probably worth ~$3 billion now. Google stands to make more if Uber is successful in using the IP they stole and their valuation soars. My guess is that the lawsuit ends in a couple billion dollar settlement so Google gets some cash out of it, and their investment is not hurt.
