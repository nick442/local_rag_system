Generally banks will thoroughly check to make sure there is a market for the item before they take it as collateral. After that they will say it's only worth 40-80% of its value to avoid price volatility. So while it is rediculous to take a Andy Warhol painting as collateral, banks will be pretty conservative on its value (usually).
