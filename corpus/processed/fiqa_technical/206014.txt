Most businesses operate at a loss for the first year or two, and reinvest all the profits for expansion for a few years after that. So higher income taxes won't affect them one bit. > I don't know why everyone focuses so much on the marginal rate of the rich, you can tax the rich 99% and you still won't have enough revenues to cover our budget deficit let alone make the investment we need in infrastructure, health, and education. Half of all incomes goes to the top 10%. They have more than enough money to fix our infrastructure and education budgets without a negative impact on their life style. (Note: I intentionally ommitted health care because money alone won't fix that mess.)
