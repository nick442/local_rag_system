Seems to ignore the fact that there are a great many other higher quality chains competing for the burger dollar now. It's most likely that the same amount of money is flowing into burgers, but companies that make their trade off efficiency and scale are being hurt by smaller region based chains. Five Guys, Whataburger, In and Out, Sonic, etc all have carved out a nice piece of the McDonald's pie.
