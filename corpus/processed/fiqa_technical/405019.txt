"I purchased a portable A/C unit from Amazon from a third party reseller, when it died after 18 months the seller had vanished and I had no evidence/proof/contact to make a claim. Manufacturer warranty was only 12 months so no luck there either. Resellers need to bake returns into their profit margin. The example in the article of electronic devices being ""too complicated"" is a good example. A non tech savvy person wants an intuitive device instead of reading a bunch of instructions, big box stores and Amazon itself realize it's a legitimate return. Someone born in the 90s trying to make a quick buck reselling imports can be like ""it's easy, just do steps A, B, F, Q, Z"" when a non tech person may only remember A+B"
