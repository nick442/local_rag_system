So how do you buy a house in or near Toronto? What are the numbers? So basically $800,000 for a starter house. Here in the midwest you would need to make $250,000 minimum to qualify for that mortgage. 2.5 time income. Is everyone renting? I see that in California? Also rents donâ€™t support the house value in the Bay Area. So basically property managers are renting not for profit but for value growth.
