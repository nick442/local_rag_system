All stocks are held in the expectation that they will eventually return money to whoever is holding the shares at the time, by one or more of the following mechanisms: Just because they aren't paying anything out now, doesn't mean they won't in the future, and even if the current shareholder sells before receiving anything, the next shareholder or the one after that (etc) will get the money. The hope of those future payouts is what ultimately makes people willing to pay for them - the current market value fluctuates at least in part based on the expectations of the people buying and selling of what those payouts will be.
