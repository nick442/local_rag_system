Let's start with the chart comparing LS80 to the S&P - Both have dividends not reflected in these returns. After adding 10% or so, the S&P during these 5 years was +55% or a bit more. As a result, the advisor lags the S&P by about 1% which makes sense. One of the problems with the nature of the question is not being able to analyze the portfolios, your's vs the VG80, for risk-adjusted return. The return your advisor got you is great if the risk (volatility) is lower than the funds or indexes you're comparing to. In the end, 4 years may not be long enough to make a proper comparison.
