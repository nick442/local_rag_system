"I just read this article, and I have to say I am utterly baffled. One of the quotes: >""This week, senior executives at the investment bank convened a group of employees to try to stem any exodus, according to several people briefed on the meeting. Among the employeesâ€™ questions: why remain at a bank that treated its top executive so harshly?"" Here's what confuses me: if you are working at that level, probably making high 6 figures or more, why in the world would you even allow yourself to be quoted about how your little fee fees got hurt because someone got fired? For fuck's sake, these guys control billions of dollars, they earn millions, they got bailed out by the fucking government and walked away free as birds after almost completely destroying the economy, they live a cushy life at the top, yet they talk like a bunch of fucking 5-year olds who got their feelings hurt on the playground."
