>AND still enough demand to fill up first class cabins There isn't. Even if/when first class cabins are full (which is a big if), a TINY minority of those people are actually paying first class fares. The vast vast vast majority are there because of free upgrades from rewards points, or on a business trip where the company is paying the ticket.
