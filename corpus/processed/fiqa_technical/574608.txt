No. Bank of America helped out during the financial crisis by buying Merrill Lynch (I am not suggesting they did this for altruistic reasons, just trying to describe the position they were in despite already purchasing Countrywide). They were forced to accept TARP but they paid it all back by the end of 2009. If the IRS fucked up their math like BofA is suggesting then they deserve to be compensated. Edit: Countrywide is one word.
