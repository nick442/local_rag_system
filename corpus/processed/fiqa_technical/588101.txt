"Great, so we agree it's not a fraud and the title of the bloomberg article is grossly misleading. Even still, to call it a bubble, you'd need to first agree to what the non-bubble valuation of Bitcoin would be. The consensus among those who use the word ""tulip"" frequently when talking about bitcoin is that the non-bubble valuation of bitcoin is zero (0). This, of course, means that Bitcoin has been in a bubble ever since the first exchange of good was made with it (which folklore tells us was a purchase of 2 pizzas for 10,000 bitcoins, establishing a price of under $0.01 per bitcoin. Ever since, for the past 7 years, Bitcoin has been in a bubble. Furthermore, for as long as Bitcoin's market value remains at or above $0.01 per bitcoin, it will still be in a bubble. If me and a few hundred thousand of my closest friends have anything to say about it, that will never happen. And therefore Bitcoin will remain in a bubble indefinitely. Now that, to me, seems like a very unusual bubble. If that strikes you as a stretch of the concept too, then maybe we need to revisit an assumption or two here. For one, is the non-bubble valuation of bitcoin really zero? Is there perhaps something about bitcoin that might give it some intrinsic value that, say, tulips or beanie babies may not have? And if there is, is there a way to estimate what that value may be? Does that value change over time? Is it perhaps possible that the value of bitcoin correlates in some fashion with its reach and its network effect? Those are harder questions to answer, and their answers is certainly not as neat and precise as ""zero"" or ""bubble"", but maybe it's useful to think about them when trying to reason about what bitcoin is and isn't."
