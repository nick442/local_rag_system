You are starting from false premises built on politically driven economic theories. The reality does not square with anything that you just wrote. The Fed is not necessary. It does incredible harm to the average guy. Fiat money and fractional reserve banking guarantee monetary collapse. You cannot continue to add debt at the bottom and cheap money at the top. Asset prices inflate and the average guy's standard of living goes down the tubes. The idea that economics is hard science is ridiculous. In a smallish closed or partially closed system, formulas and equations can determine probable outcomes, in the infinitely complex economy of the modern world, the very idea that you can predict anything beyond general directions is absurd. And the general directions are not understandable without considering the human motivations that drive each of the billions of sentient actors involved. But cleave to Samuelson, at least it can make you feel superior to think that you understand the pointless complexity
