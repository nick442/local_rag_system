It's a tough one to solve. The cost just to give everyone $30k would be crippling in terms of taxes. And it would cover nothing in high COL regions. Skill work such as accounting is easily $70-$80k for a CPA, much more for director, and $200k for controller plus stock options. It will be ridiculous to expect compensation at those levels due to replacement robots or software. What about doctors with median income $200k, or $400k for successful dentists or heart surgeons. Shit will get cray cray. Production might triple due to 24/7 operation. But distribution will always be difficult, especially with lobbying as industry will never allow extreme taxation to cover universal income. This will get even more confusing when you can price an old worker, but not the sixteen year old who will never go to medical school as the industry will become impossible to earn a living.
