"As Dheer pointed out, Wikipedia has a good definition of what a negotiable instrument is. A security is an instrument or certificate that signifies an ownership interest in something tangible. 1 share of IBM represents some small fraction of a company. You always have the ability to choose a price you are willing to pay -- which may or may not be the price that you get. A derivative is a level of abstraction linked by a contract to a security.. if you purchase a ""Put"" contract on IBM stock, you have a contractural right to sell IBM shares at a specific price on a specific date. When you ""own"" a derivative, you own a contract -- not the actual security."
