> Also, who the hell is Phillip Greenspun? Clearly you weren't a web geek back in the mid '90s ;-) Philip Greenspun was a professor at MIT and photography enthusiast who built [photo.net](http://photo.net) (one of the first big database-backed web sites) by wiring together AOLServer, Oracle, and TCL. The pages were rendered through a combination of static HTML and database content pulled from Oracle. It included a bunch of excellent photography tutorials with dynamic Q&A sections at the footer of each page along with online discussion forums. No big deal today, but this was shit-hot technology back then. He started a company to commercialize the technology, cashed in for a couple of million, and now writes about [early retirement](http://philip.greenspun.com/materialism/early-retirement/).
