"Not necessarily. The IRS deals with income taxes. I'd have to run the numbers, but I'm not sure if this would short the IRS versus deducting wages paid at time and a half. Usually, a state's Department of Labor (or similar) would go after him for something like this. Also, this sounds like plain old fraud, so a criminal charge could be brought. What's also interesting is how the franchise's CPA and/or Subway's corporate accounting handled this. ""Phantom"" employees are a big no-no, but are more commonly used to hide embezzlement. There are a number of tests auditors are supposed to perform to weed out phantom employees. I wonder if they did and covered it up or if they never bothered to test. Either is bad. /lawyer and accountant"
