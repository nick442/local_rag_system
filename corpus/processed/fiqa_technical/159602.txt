"Did they just only ask ""how much money do you have in a savings account?"". I followed the links to the gobankingrates.com site and it seems so. I could have $2M in a taxable brokerage account with the cash portion in MM, $1M in IRA savings, own my home outright and have 0 in a savings account. A savings account is stupid, btw."
