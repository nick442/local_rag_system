"From your original reply to me >Another typical redditor who doesn't even know the difference between a depository bank and an investment bank I'm the ""typical redditor"" who doesn't know the difference between a depository bank and an investment bank. So, you dumb fuck, tell me. Which one is Citibank? Also.. >the CEO of a financial institution that was partly responsible for keeping the US economy from the shithole is a ""fucker"" Those CEOs (including this prick) were responsible for it. CDOs and mortgage backed securities loaded with shit mortgages didn't just fucking emerge from thin air. The big banks created them and loved them because they made billions in fees from them, and they never stopped to evaluate either the individual risks of the products or the systemic risks in the system. They didn't care because they knew the taxpayers would pick up the tab. So pull your head out of your ass and unfuck yourself, you moron. On the other hand, why don't you go the other way and completely fuck yourself. Since you can't even tell this typical redditor what type of bank Citibank is you're fucking worthless."
