">I've found most of my personal success looking for work by way of the burgeoning technical recruiter industry - they know a bit more than an HR 'bot', either mechanical or human (haha), about the reality of technical requirements for a job and are able to find you if you just know where to place yourself. Yes, that is another way ""around"" the HR bot-ery. But it tends to be expensive (granted the ""company"" doing the hiring does the paying, but I can guarantee you that the cost inevitably comes OUT of the possible salary/benefits of the hiree). >Getting solicited for a job by way of your LinkedIn profile is a much easier way of finding work than the futile carpet-bombing of large corporate HR machines, no doubt. Yes, alas.. that seems to be about the only way that most people (including ironically enough college grads with HR & MBA degrees) seem to think about jobs: the ""carpet bombing"" of HR departments combined with the continual scanning of ""jobs"" listings. I want to weep every time some college grad tells me they were ""taught"" to use Monster.com (et al) as a *primary* means of obtaining a position. I mean seriously, USE those research and networking skills that you claim to have to FIND a company that you WANT to work for, and then find a way to get a position in that company. It is an ACTIVE thing, not a ""passive"" one. People who do that tend to actually GET (one of the) jobs they want, rather than being ""stuck"" in something where.. well, they were the first ones to make an offer.."
