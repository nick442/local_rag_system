"Yes, I'm a big picture guy. Like when the central banks opened unlimited short term lines recently the first thing I thought was ""now hedge funds can short the euro with impunity!"" So, short bets on the euro became a no brainer even as the market was perversely celebrating the announcement with a euro rally. Almost as if they have no idea how the bigger picture works. As if all liquidity is created equally. All it meant to me was that European banks would not have to call in the lines of credit they extend to hedge funds for THREE YEARS. That is enough time to crash the euro, hold a funeral and dance on the grave. It is just musical chairs over there. All the banks know the EU is coming for them an they all want to be in the right capital position to survive the banhammer. They'll sell out the euro to get there. I think I'm a bit too jaded for Graham style fundamental analysis. Then again I do use strong companies as my preferred trading vehicles. So, maybe I do a hybrid."
