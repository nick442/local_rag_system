I agree with some of them, but these lists always fail to mention how important cash is. It's why up and coming billion dollar companies give away large stakes. Have solid cash reserves ready to be used can get you out of any tight jam you may be in. Whether it's paying somebody to fix something for you or covering an unexpected expense. Cash is one of the Kings in the business world. Other thing is that networking is a big one. I go to conferences when they are coordinated locally and have met a handful of solid people that way.
