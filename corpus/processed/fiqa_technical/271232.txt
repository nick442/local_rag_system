"While people will say, ""I'm going to sue you for all your worth!"", that's not how it really works. When someone brings a lawsuit, they are supposed to show how much harm you actually caused them. The court then awards them an amount equal to whatever the judge or jury are convinced was the actual harm. So in the case of a car accident, if someone can convince the court that you caused the accident and that he had $100,000 in medical bills, lost wages from work, and/or whatever other expenses, than the court will order you to pay $100,000. (A court can add on compensation for ""pain and suffering"", and it can add ""punitive damages"" if you were reckless and irresponsible, but that doesn't change the point here.) If you're a billionaire and this is less than you spend on lunch in a week, good for you, you pay it and you're done. If your only assets are the clothes you're wearing and your iPhone, and you don't have enough insurance to cover it, then you will be in debt for a long, long time. Saying, ""Sorry, I don't have that much money"" will not help. Your liability is not limited to what you can afford to pay. Many people say that in real life courts will order big companies that are responsible for an accident to pay more than it would order an ordinary person to pay because they figure that they can afford it. I don't know whether that's true. But even if the court goes easy on you because you're poor, you can still be ordered to pay a substantial amount of money. If the amount is totally beyond what you have -- if the court orders you to pay $1 million and you make $10,000 a year -- than the other person can't expect to ever get all their money. But you'll be paying for the rest of your life."
