A parking lot is someone else's property. They get to decide whether you can park a mobile home or equivalent, and can demand you remove it at any time. Similarly, permission to charge an electric car us not permission to use power for anything else. And health codes will be applied to your housing, as will zoning laws, as will.. Without permission you are just begging for trouble. With permission (which may involve paying rent for the space and paying for utilities) you're still likely to find this much more complicated, difficult, and expensive than it appears.
