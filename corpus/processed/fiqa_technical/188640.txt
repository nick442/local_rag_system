They are the worst. I knew all about these deceptive practices when I decided to open a checking account for my business with them in 2015. I was working in a remote place and it was one of the two banks that had locations germane to both work sites.I didn't like signing up with them because of all this bullshit but hey, they had the branches, right? Then I found out they were charging my workers $5 to cash checks. Pressured them to open an account or else: $5. Fuck you and the carriage you rode in on, Mr. Wells. I went to the other small regional bank and even though they don't have a slick web interface that makes it easier for me they DON'T charge my guys to get their money. Never again.
