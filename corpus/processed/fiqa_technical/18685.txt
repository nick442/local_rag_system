"Let's talk innovation. You say that 80% of people will provide 100% of societies needs. Perhaps. But what about society's desires? Why, some of the finest minds in business are working and investing right now to exploit the natural resources of outer space. Tourism, mining, transport, why the sky is no longer the limit! See Spacex, Virgin Galactic, etc. You can't tell me you wouldn't go on a space-cation. Well, I'll bet that would be a great source of jobs that NO ONE does right now. Space valet, space bellhop, space waiter, space hotel manager, PLUS we need pilots to get people up and down, engineers to build the hotels, etc. etc. etc. Edit: As to your point about wealth flowing upwards, that's just a problem with laissez-faire capitalism in general: if left to their own devices, wealthy people tend to hoard wealth imo. I think tax and spending reform would go a long way to allieviating the ""upward"" flow of capital over the last few years."
