Hi guys, This is an app I've been working on over the summer. It's my belief that a lot of people want to learn about the stock market but in the end can't because they're turned off by long walls of text you get when you Google about them/read a textbook. I know there are other simplified solutions out there but they're not widely adopted yet and I don't think there are any (?) that were made app first. Anyway, check it out if you can. Appreciate all feedback/comments.
