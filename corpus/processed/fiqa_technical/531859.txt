"> People will lose faith in college degrees and start working as contractors, plumbers, mechanics, etc. This will generate a direct wealth, but it will also severely hurt our ability to innovate due to the resulting ""brain drain"" I disagree. People who do not benefit from a college education will stop muddling through college, and be productive instead. People who benefit from advanced training in a field will still find college worthwhile. In fact, maybe some decently smart people will contribute to plumbing innovation instead of learning (economically) useless art history. (This is only to speak of economic value of education. Education is still a fine thing for anyone to obtain as a ""consumer good"".)"
