keep working on it, a lot of people lose momentum. Start small, and buy as many products as you can and flip them. Start growing a profit, then eventually you'll start having enough for a store. To get funds, just get a job as a busser somewhere and work as many shifts as you can, you can make around 300- 400$ a week, save up for a few months.
