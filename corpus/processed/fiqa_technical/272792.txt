Think of it like professional athlete salaries. For every 10,000 people with talent and drive there is one that makes it into the NFL with a multi-million dollar salary. Likewise there are thousands of people with banking related degrees working 80-100 hours a week for shit wages with the hope that they'll make the cut and eventually hit it big with some sweet super high paying job someday.
