"And this is how you end up with shit code, shit policies, shit thinking, shit morale and generally piles of shit everywhere, under every rug and in every corner. Your employee's don't just hate you, they seem to actively look for ways to steal from you or otherwise hinder your progress. And finally worst still the person that is MOST likely to take ""We live in an economy where, unfortunately, there is a ready supply of labor to take the place of those who quit or otherwise leave the company. This brings the value of your current employees down."" as a serious threat and fear for their jobs are almost always the LEAST skilled and the largest idiots of the bunch. So you end up with C-man syndrome in a business filled with people that would punch you in the kidney and steal your wallet if they knew it was you that had made all those shitty choices. /experience."
