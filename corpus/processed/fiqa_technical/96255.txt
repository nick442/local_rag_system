"Find another job and leave ASAP, before the situation starts spilling outside. We all tend to work in relatively small ""work bubbles"", where key people in different companies talk to each other. If you leave now, you leave with your reputation intact and can look for a job while you still have a job If the situation gets worse, you can be ""marked"" as a troublemaker, and will make your search for a job harder. Also, should you get fired, you would be looking for a job as an unemployed person, which is a much worse situation to be in. As you discovered, HR's job is to protect the company, and usually the table is tilted in favor of management (simply because they have a longer history usually and more invested in them), so fighting the situation is rarely worth it, unless you have real proof of illegal behavior. Get out now"
