"A ""sunk cost"" is a cost that you have already incurred, and won't get back. The ""sunk cost fallacy,"" as you described, is when you make a bad decision based on your sunk cost. When you identify a sunk cost, you realize that the money has been spent, and the decision is irreversible. Future decisions should not take this cost into account. When you commit the ""sunk cost fallacy,"" you are keeping something that is bad simply because you spent a lot of money on it. You are failing to identify the correct current value of something based on its high cost to you in the past. The other fallacy you describe, the opposite of the sunk cost fallacy, is when you get rid of something that is good simply because you spent little on it. As before, you are also failing to correctly identify the correct current value of something, but in this case, you are assigning too little a value based on the low cost in the past. You could call this a type of ""opportunity cost,"" a loss of future benefits due to a mistake made today. It seems reasonable to describe this type of fallacy as an ""opportunity cost fallacy."""
