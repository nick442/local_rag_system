Free trade agreements are not about trade. Thats just their pretext. They use free trade agreements to get all sorts of things that legislators would never vote for. Now I hear the FTAs are putting the US taxpayer into a state of potential liability for a lot of financial hijinks in other countries, and - if they put exporting energy into [TTIP](http://www.ttip2014.eu), also making us liable if we decide to stop [the flow of energy, natural gas, overseas](http://action.sierraclub.org/site/DocServer/Analysis_of_EU_Energy_Proposal_TTIP.pdf) for many wholly legitimate reasons - we would be asked to pay huge amounts if we stopped it, say, because it was killing jobs here having energy cost twice or three times as much. thats not a good reason, just like not being able to affording healthcare for your country under the insurance system is [not a good enough reason](http://www.italaw.com/sites/default/files/case-documents/italaw3206.pdf) to switch to single payer without running afoul of an FTA once its been signed.
