I think there is a rather unclear line, but it is being crossed. I don't want to say NO career advice, because there has been some really helpful questions asked that, while they want to know for a job search, are helpful. There's also the posts like WHAT DOES AN INVESTY BANKER ACTUALLY DO? That don't belong here. Tricky to differentiate what's okay from what isn't, but at the moment I'd rather downvote the incorrectly posted to keep the useful posts
