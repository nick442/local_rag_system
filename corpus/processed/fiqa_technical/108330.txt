I get paid a 50 cents more at my second job than my day job, and at the end of the week my take home pay from the latter is $20 higher. Thats a bullshit argument. $5 per hour is a lot of money, especially considering that a lot of people have been living paycheck to paycheck throughout Obamas never ending recovery. What makes a postman's hours $5 more valuable than a FedEx employee? By every measure, FedEx is a more productive and efficient entity than the US Postal Service. So why is the postman worth more? I'll tell you exactly why. The FedEx employee's compensation is needs based. FedEx does a certain amount of business, which requires a certain amount of labor, which commands a certain price in the labor market. FedEx does not pay more for labor than it has to, because FedEx must be an efficient organization to meet its customers price expectations. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Postal_Service The Postman's compensation is arbitrary, set by government officials with no direct accountability to customers. Because they know jack shit about logistics, Congress has mandated that the Postal Service offer services to the public at uniform price and quality. As such, it has continuously failed to manage its budget properly, to the tune of $5 to $10 billion dollar deficiets every year with a total mail volume that has declined 29% between 1998 and 2008. Why does the Postal Service exist? Because it makes your congressman feel good, and he's more than willing to burn your money on the pyre of his sentimentality and false morilization over the massive, arbitrarily created vested interest postal employees have in losing their above average pay hack jobs than for any dedication you percieve he has to the welfare of his constituents. If you want me to run down why I believe our government is not acting in our own personal best interests, the postal service is the perfect place to start.
