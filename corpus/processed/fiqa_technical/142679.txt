Certainly some channels like History (tbf it was always a little crappy) and Discovery turned to total crap but stations like FX and AMC went from showing shitty 80's movies to producing some of the best original shows of all time. Sci-fi has gone mostly shit, but it still does sci-fi original programming. Really, DVDs, DVR and Netflix have ruined rerun value. Networks can only make money on new stuff. So they show shit most of the time, and go to good stuff of a couple hours a week.
