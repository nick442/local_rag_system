There's plenty of companies selling groceries. I would say there's only one online store with an almost entirely vertically integrated business model where you buy goods and have them delivered by that same company. Literally the only middle-man left for Amazon to cut out is the manufacturers/distributors which for now probably won't be integrated to reduce risk/increase flexibility.
