Imagine 4 guys in charge of the entire Evian company. CEO, CFO, Legal and Operations. The rest are robots and automated. You go to the factory and you see the 'machine' producing bottled water on its own, from the springs, to the plant, to the bottling, packing, even trucks are self-driving. Kind of creepy.
