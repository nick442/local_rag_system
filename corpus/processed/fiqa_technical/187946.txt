I understand that they made a mistake but I think we're missing the point here. Nothing in business goes swimmingly and besides, if you aren't making mistakes, you aren't trying anything new. I think the media is blinded by short-term macroeconomic factors, meagre company issues and forecasts. Forecasts are just that, forecasts. They're not certain and of course, some years they'll miss them. That's no problem. Management is actively engaged in resolving these issues and they're aware of them, they're not complacent. They're expected to sell roughly $1.6 billion of Teavana products through Starbucks this year and are expanding Teavana's offerings through Anheuser-Busch. When Starbucks opened their first store in Chicago, it underperformed. Needless to say, Starbucks is flourishing today. I think we all need to take a step back here and focus on long-term objectives rather than insignificant short-term issues when management are prudently resolving them.
