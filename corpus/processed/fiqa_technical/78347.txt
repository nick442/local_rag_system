"So you believe people are free to have opinions, act on them. But what is a business except a bunch of people interacting with others? Do you stop being human when you walk through the doors of your work? Using terms like ""companies should provide a service"" sounds like they are staffed by machines, and we should force them to do whatever they want, which is troubling. In my opinion, companies should be free not to bake cakes for neo-nazis or gay couples. Of course, I would boycott the latter, as would many people, I suspect. The free market forces people to cooperate, because bigoted organization will lose business. My biggest problem with Paypal's decision is I'm not sure I trust them to determine who is a ""hate group"" fairly, like you said. (Of course, I trust the government even less.) But the good news is if they implement their policy unfairly, then they'll get slapped by the invisible hand and go broke. The free market is one of the freest, most democratic systems we have."
