> > The state has never, over 30 years, followed standard practice and used an actuary to determine how much to put into the pension funds each year. The legislators just pulled numbers out of the air each year. As a result the pensions have never been properly funded. The benefits are rich but, according to the people on this panel the main issue is this under funding. This is a half truth. Mr. Ingram, CPS and others are just as at fault for letting politicians kick the can down the road. In contract negotiations, they don't pressure the legislature to come up with the money and keeping those pension accounts funded. The state passed a law in 1988 changing the length of time the state needed to cover its pension debt, expanding it to 40 years, and the Teachers Unions never cared as long as they got as large a promise as possible. As long as the payment promises are large, they never cared about having the accounts funded. > 2/3 of the teacher's pension hole is for people already retired. Changing benefits for current teachers will not help enough. A good chunk of these teachers are retiring with 6 figure salaries that grow at 3% per annum. It's insane, whether they are already retired or not. The math is insane.
