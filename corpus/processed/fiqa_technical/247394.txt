It seems to me that oil will never again reach or exceed $100 a barrel. The rate at which we are abandoning fossil fuels means we will never ever run out of the stuff. Demand will continue to decrease, and electric cars will be the first cars that are owned by the people in emerging markets in the next decade. And in a decade from now, 90% of all new cars will be purely electric. Beyond that, Fusion research on multiple fronts (but not ITER - that will never ever produce a plan for a viable power station) points to total destruction of coal and gas as a fuel for power stations. And when they come online, you don't even need to build new power stations! All you do is build banks of reactors in the car park, hook up the steam pipes to the new reactors, and then bulldoze the old furnaces. Job done.
