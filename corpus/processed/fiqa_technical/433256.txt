You weren't eligible for a 401K in 2010, but you were eligible for an individual IRA. If you had known by April 18th that you had this extra money, you could have deposited (not rolled over) the money, up to the maximum ($5,000 or so, I think), into an IRA account You could do that because you didn't participate (legally) in an employer retirement program. But you didn't learn until early May, so you missed that deadline. I doubt that the IRS has any provisions for waiving that April 18th deadline, but I could be wrong: see the IRS publications. In any case, to answer the question directly - no, you can't roll over the money you're getting back, because it was mistakenly in the 401K plan. It will now become part of your 2011 income, and so you'll owe taxes on it when you file your tax return for the tax year 2011, in early 2012.
