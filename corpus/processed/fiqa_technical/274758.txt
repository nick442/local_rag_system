I think the era of IT speaking like they are way over end user's head should be over. End users need to be more educated in this day and age and they can serve as great allies when properly instructed. Even if it has to be in layman's terms the end user should be able to somewhat grasp the concept of the work they are paying for. Of course I think this should be done with honesty and full disclosure.
