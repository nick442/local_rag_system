"I know some CEOs (for both big and small companies). A few have admitted to me on a few occasions they themselves don't have the slightest idea about being a CEO. The world changes too fast so they have absolutely no idea what's going to work and what isn't when it comes time to make decisions. All they can do is rely on the recommendations of the people that work under them at which point it becomes a matter of trust: Do you trust the recommendations from your CTO? Who did he trust to make that recommendation? The trust chain goes waaay down and it makes you wonder if the people who ""know"" (at the end of the chain) shouldn't have been able to just make the decision themselves."
