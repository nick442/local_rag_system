"These government mandates of minimum wage will cause more problems than they will solve. I don't know how many of you own a small business but I can give you a real world example here in the City of Chicago. On July 1st, 2017 the minimum wage will increase to $11.00 while at the same time they're introducing a .01 per oz ""Sugar Tax."" The amount of additional work needed to keep track of sugar consumption will be burdensome for small businesses who will have to raise prices to accommodate the new labor costs and tax. Customers are price sensitive so they will usually go for the cheaper option which can be provided only by corporate/big business who have the ability to automate certain positions in the labor supply chain which is currently happening. I wouldn't be surprised if the timeline for kiosks/self-service robot implementation is on par with the $15.00 minimum wage deadline in 2019. To sum up, big business wins and labor loses but I guess results don't matter when your intentions are ""good."""
