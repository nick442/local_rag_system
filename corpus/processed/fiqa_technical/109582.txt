Our view is that just be cause AMZN can disrupt somebody else's profit stream, it doesn't mean that AMZN earns that profit stream. For the moment, the market doesn't agree. Perhaps, simply being disruptive is enough. While he is right in theory, the problem with this viewpoint is it is incredibly short sighted. Amazon is disrupting spaces to the point of near outright ELIMINATING entire markets. When Amazon eliminates a market, that revenue has to go SOMEWHERE.. and while Amazon may not turn a profit on it now, since they now own that entire market it would be extremely simple to in the future. I can make simmilar comments for most of these companies. The reason disruption is being valued so high is because the disruption happening today is so massive compared to history. The disruption these four companies are causing is on the order of magnitude of what Ford caused with the assembly line.. Except greater.
