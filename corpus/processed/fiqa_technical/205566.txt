"My car, that you've probably never even heard of, can recognize street lines, pedestrians, other cars, rain, whether I'm paying attention and road conditions. It can apply the gas, the brakes, and steer. It can drive itself and park itself. Having said all that it's, at times, profoundly stupid. 60% of the time it can drive itself perfectly competently; 20% of the time it struggles and 20% of the time it would happily smash into a ditch. Not great but this is on a car that isn't even advertised as having any level of autonomy. So, my thinking on it has evolved. I do think we're a long way away from a car you can truly trust to drive you. However I think we're probably only about 2 to 3 model years away from a reasonably priced production car that can do MOST of the driving, safely, with you there just to make sure it doesn't screw up. In fact, the autonomous features on my car are gimped on purpose. The car CAN fully steer itself in reasonably well painted lines but Ford engineers have the system turn itself off if you aren't actively ""helping"" it. if they threw caution to the wind my current car with current tech could drive without me touching anything for probably about 60% of my ride to and from work. Further, the system itself is surprisingly sophisticated in some ways. Lane marker recognition is very good. The control that the system exhibits during assisted parking is..it's hard to even explain unless you experience it. Suffice to say that the mechanical and sensor tech is already here. I still think we're a very long way away from getting into your back seat and telling the car to take you somewhere so if you define self-driving that way then yes, it's a long distance away. But if you define self-driving as needing to be there but not needing to do much, I think that's very close."
