It appears to me that US agribusiness is angry at poor countries for giving poor people food and the US pharmaceutical industry is angry at India for making cheap generic drugs, even though few people can afford their products in poor countries. (Drug prices in the US itself have more than doubled since 2008) These three trade deals, TTIP, TISA and TPP that the US is pushing in our names basically take positions that few Americans would agree with, which is why they are kept secret.
