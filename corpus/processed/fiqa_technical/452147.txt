The founding fathers designed senators to be appointed by the state legislatures. Instead we elect them and they vote for federal bills which commit state taxes to some federal issue. They also designed a house where each representative was elected by 3,000 voters. Now each represents 700,000 and spends all their time getting money from donars instead of representing people they actually spoke to when campaigning. Maybe we need to go back to the way it was originally set up.
