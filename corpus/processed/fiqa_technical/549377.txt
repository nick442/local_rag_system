First of all, my comment has nothing to do with Trump, yet you want to bash as if I am maligning Trump. Whether Trump is behind it or Obama is behind it or Bush is behind it, $12 billion is a minuscule fraction of the national debt. THAT is my point, which was clear from my original posting. Secondly, unless we are running a positive balance, we are still increasing our national debt. It looks like we are [**still** running a deficit](http://federal-budget.insidegov.com/l/120/2017-Estimate), which means national debt is continuing to increase, at a rate of $443 billion, or about 37 times this quoted $12 billion.
