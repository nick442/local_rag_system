"You would, but we are talking retail not manufacturing. If one of the big production lines where I worked broke down for an hour, no problem. In any case we had mechanics on site who could handle a simple breakdown. We would have to rush, but we could make up the production quota. In retail, it is another issue. If you have to say ""no burgers"" at a fast-food joint for an hour or more, it is more of an issue."
