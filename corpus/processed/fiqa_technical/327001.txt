> but saying that increase in cost won't affect an increase in price and that average people will be better able to afford higher construction costs is misleading. I did not say that. So, let me clarify: construction companies, like any company, are in the business to maximize profits. Yes, they will attempt to charge more and they probably will charge more. But the consumer, can only pay what they can pay. So I am sure that 30% increase in costs will not translate to 30% increase on every construction job.
