"As cars age, the amount of deprecation tends to decrease. You have already lost between 19 and 17K on the car in the past 3.5 years. You can't lose that much on that car ever again! First because it is not worth that much. Second, because even if the engine blows up, or it is totaled you can always get about $300-$400 for it. If you trade this car for a newer model the same exact scenario is likely to happen again. In three years (or so) the car will lose half its value. If you happen to stick the same price point, and are comfortable with $5000/year going ""out the window"", then it might be time to trade up. You can get a decent idea of what your car will be worth in the 2.5 years by seeing what a 2006 with 116K miles on it. One option is to keep driving it after it is paid off. With putting a little money into it, and having it detailed every once in a while it can feel like a pretty sweet ride for many years and miles to come. Even if you have maintenance costs, you won't have a car payment. How sweet would that be?"
