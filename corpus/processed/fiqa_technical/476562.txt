I just wanted to let people know of a strange little way bankruptcy works in society when dealing with individuals and when dealing with businesses. If I as a person declare bankruptcy, my credit score goes downhill. I find loans have higher interest rates, some people won't lend the amounts I want, and I have to pay more up front. If as a business I declare bankruptcy, my individual credit score (not business) does not suffer AT ALL. My business likely will have a harder time getting loans, that is unless someone buys me out or I collapse the business and start a new business, maybe even the exact same business with the same clients. I personally, am not held accountable for anything (unless I was a sole proprietor of course and didn't incorporate). That to me, is the major problem. Corporations mean never having to say you're sorry. No matter how high up you are, you are never individually accountable for your actions. In fact, I highly suggest anyone considering bankruptcy simply form a corporation, dump their debt assets into it, and then have the corporation declare bankruptcy. Viola, instant clean credit score and all your debts are paid. Just watch out for [vicarious liability :p](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicarious_liability)
