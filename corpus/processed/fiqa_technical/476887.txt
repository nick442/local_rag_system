I work in a firm that performs this kind of execution for a number of instutional traders. We sell a number of algorithms, and a lot of research goes into building good market signals and forecasts, but the basic idea is that we make a trade-off between time to execute and market impact. This generally means that we're doing a mix of everything you said; we will join the bid for some fraction of our size, and also hit the offer when it looks like the price might be moving away from us. In some certain situations we will even sweep the book several levels deep to avoid tipping off market makers and having them adjust in anticipation of the rest of our order.
