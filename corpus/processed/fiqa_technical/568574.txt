You did read the massive disclaimer about how not all subsidies are included it the report right? When you cherry pick only the categories you want it makes up whatever argument you want. Try including everything else like grants, foreign tax credits for example and the numbers are staggering. And that not even broaching the money we've spend on attempt to procure and stabilize middle east oil sources. I don't need an army to protect my roof solar panels from ISIS. http://www.energyandcapital.com/report/the-real-truth-about-energy-subsidies/491 Edit: I don't know why I bothered. You post in t_d, conspiracy and cap it all off with libertarian. Class act you are!
