I tried to like /r/Anarchism, but the mentality portrayed there is that of a statist who is pissed that *they* aren't the dictator, and are willing to use violence and theft to achieve their goals. Please shove /r/Anarchism up your ass, and visit /r/Anarcho_Capitalism to understand what the Non Aggression Principle is, and how to engage in voluntary transactions without duplicity or threats.
