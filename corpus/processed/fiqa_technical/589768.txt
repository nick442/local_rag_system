If an advisor uses asset allocation and risk management in conjunction with financial planning, performance will be adequate for each client's goals in the LONG RUN. Past performance doesn't mean shit for the future and imo, bragging on performance in a prospect meeting signals that they don't have any other value to lean on and likely take on more risk than they should to show that performance.
