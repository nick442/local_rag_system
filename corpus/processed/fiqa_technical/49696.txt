I used to sell electronics at sears. Let me tell you something about the sears I worked at. At the time, sears could not figure out how to keep track of how many TVs we had. So whenever a customer wanted a tv, we had to dash across the store, go into the backroom, get a manager to open the tv cage, and physically check if we had the tv in stock. This was a colossal waste of time, and we never really had more than 2 or 3 of any given TV at a time. I lost sales all the time because we didn't have tvs in stock. Turns out people don't want to wait a week to pick up a TV they bought. My coworkers and I complained to our manager about this but nothing was ever done.
