I really want people to answer this. I need to build my general macro repertoire and good news is key. I was getting the Bridgewater Dailies at my last job and they are *fantastic*. Unfortunately they are super expensive and only businesses can afford them. I read a lot of the general economics output of major banks which is free on their websites. I also read a selection of blogs which have an economics/macro tilt, but tend to be a lot of opinion and academic stuff. This is what I've been reading recently: [Krugman](http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/) [Marginal Revolution](http://marginalrevolution.com/) [Project Syndicate](http://www.project-syndicate.org/) [Noah Smith](http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.jp/) [The Upshot](http://www.nytimes.com/upshot/) I also read Reuters for economics news generally since there is no paywall. Hope this helps, and I really hope there is more quality free stuff out there that I've missed.
