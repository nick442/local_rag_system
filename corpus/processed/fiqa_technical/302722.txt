This article is BS. Middle management is a corporate disease that allows business to grow bigger while providing less service. The more middle management there is, the more the business will dodge accountability, and the less they will respond to customer input. That is not a dig at the people, that is simply a *function* of middle management -they are a class of employees who deal with fundamental problem but do not have the authority to make fundamental decisions. Ass-covering and drifting out of touch are the natural results.
