You must read E-Myth by Michael Gerber. I've had a business for 13 years. I read this book 4 years ago and it changed everything. It's about building systems within your business that allow it to eventually run on its own, which brings it that much more value. Everyone always also recommends, The Millionaire Next Door (It's a great book, but can be tedious). It essentially takes a statistical look at real millionaires and their lifestyles, and shows that making a lot of money and living modestly leads to true wealth, as opposed to successfull people who make a lot of money but have too many large liabilities (excessively expensive cars and houses ect.) so their net worth is less than a million. It's not about having tons of money, it's about living modestly. The last one is 7 habits of highly effective people. I haven't gotten to that one yet. Edit. More general advice: Pay taxes on your money as it comes in. Don't wait until the end of the year and get a huge tax bill. Also, have an endgame goal or vision to start with, so you can always have a guide to where you're going. For Instance: do you want to always run and operate your business or do you hope to build it and then sell? Or do you want to be a hands off owner eventually and have someone else manage it? The better shaped your endgame vision is, the easier it will be to get there. Be stingy, especially at first, you need cash. Dont go buying a brand new Mac laptop and an office space you don't need. Eventually you'll learn when you need to spend money and when to be stingy.
