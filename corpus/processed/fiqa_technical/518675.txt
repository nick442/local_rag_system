Who has the throwaway? Does reddit take everything so serious that a throwaway is needed anytime something doesn't go along 100% with popular opinion? Shit, I wasn't even challenging that it's lower. > The statistics may be rock solid, Sure, just as any possible hypothesis I could come up, no? John Smith *might* have been right, and the smell coming from my kitchen *might* be the old tuna (I think it's the bananas, though). Frailties may have been poor wording, but bear with me, it was a sarcastic comment on reddit - the amount of time I spent thinking about word choice was shorter than the amount of time I spent thinking about whether I wanted another cup of coffee (I did, I always do.) Listen, the whole point of my comment was to be a sarcastic point out that Redditors (read: humans) shouldn't just take things for face value, just because it agrees with what you think. You should still always be diggin'. It might be 40%, or might be 90%. Although, personally, I like to be conservative with estimates, so I would have worded this entire title differently, or used 25% with this title, not 40%. The article clearly says: > 40% admitted they are generally *wary* Sure, I'm wary that my second cup of coffee will give me the runs - but it doesn't hold me back. And > A quarter said they would rather hire a man to get around issues of maternity leave So, 25% *might* avoid hiring them, not 40%. I thought 40% seemed a bit high.. didn't think that many would put THAT much stock in that one 'metric' of potential hires.
