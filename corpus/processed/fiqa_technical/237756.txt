The news is sort of out there, Its just very local but will affect neighbouring countries and prices if the winter hits hard. Im just thinking that because I only see it being picked up by local news (in the local language) that maybe not all investors on the energy market are aware yet. There are so many more obvious news that affects the european market that investors would trade on currently (ukraine etc.) that I dont think they are following local news in a foreign language
