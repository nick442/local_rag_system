You're right, the issue of inversion is not going to go away as long as there are countries willing to go to 2% on their tax rate. But the goal isn't really to eliminate them it's to have a tax system and regulatory system which encourages healthy business growth and financial support to the government. The path the US has chosen is high corporate tax, cherry pick activities they want to encourage through breaks, then rely on taxing overseas profits on money returned to the US (since so many major companies are US based). This was a great system but its an anachronism since globalization became a real thing. Now what it has left us with is a tax incentive system where ONLY the business activities with breaks (RD tax credit) are considered worthwhile ventures while profit centers are offshored. Then no one can reinvest their profits in the US because they can't repatriate cash without paying tax. The corporate tax structure now hinders employment and investment. We don't need to lower our taxes to 0 to be competitive. The most popular countries for offshoring are Puerto Rico (pharma) Ireland and Switzerland their tax rates are effectively 0. However due to other costs (employment transportation of goods) on a total cost basis the US can be more than competitive with a corp tax rate of 20%.
