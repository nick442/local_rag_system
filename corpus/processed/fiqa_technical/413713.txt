Through talking with the head of our finance department yesterday and a few BI guys, i think i'm gonna learn SQL and Python so I can then move on to something like Tableau with a strong base. The company will pay for my training of it so I'm lucky with that. Do you have any specific ways you recommend I learn SQL/Python? I know of CodeAcademy but haven't done too much other research.
