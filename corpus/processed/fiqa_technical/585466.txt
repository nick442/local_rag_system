"Anticompetitive behavior is only illegal if a monopoly does it, and amazon is not a monopoly. But with billions in the bank, they can act like one indefinitely, which makes me wonder if we should rethink those laws. Edit: ""only illegal if a monopoly does it"" might not be accurate in this case. It might just be that American courts are reluctant to take action against this sort of thing."
