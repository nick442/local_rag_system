"A friend of mine is a Prepaid Legal lawyer. It's not an exclusive relationship: he does other things too. Most lawyers regard Prepaid Legal as a way of getting more customers. They lose money on the Prepaid Legal stuff, but then ""upsell"" their paid services. My friend tells me that he'd answer most of the Prepaid Legal questions for free, in hopes of building a customer base. He didn't signup for the trivial amount of money Prepaid Legal gives him."
