They used to. People got hired at entry level jobs and were trained on the job. They learned from the person above them and moved up the ladder. Then they taught the person below them while learning from the person above them. This continued for a whole career. Trades still work this way. Now we've traded on the job training for minimum hiring requirements. We've traded moving up for having to move to another company. And we've traded proper raises for standard 3% increases until you quit and move to another company to do a job for which you have the minimum hiring requirements.
