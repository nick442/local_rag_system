"As an entrepreneur, I have nothing against ambitious people working hard to become rich. I do however have a problem with people who want to hear bad economic news on hopes the central banks will pump money into it and push the markets up. I get even more pissed seeing these undeserving pricks get rich when their dreams come true. I am not saying the stock market is a bad thing. But if you get rich why not start a business and build real wealth then maybe invest a little in it? Why depend on the stock market as a primary means of generating wealth? Some of these people are like parasitic traitors hoping for everyone else to suffer so they can get rich off of them (notice I said ""some"" not ""all."" edit:if you are going to downvote me at least have the balls to tell me what you disagree with. Maybe I'm saying something stupid and being a dick. I admit it's happened before but at least call me out instead of being passive-aggressive about it."
