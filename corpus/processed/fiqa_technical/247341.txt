Who would be committing this fraud? Satoshi Nakamoto? Good luck finding him. You can't punish people for speculatively investing just like they couldn't punish many people for the Great Depression since it was mostly the people who fucked themselves over. Fraud implies an element of deceit. This cannot reasonably be called a fraud--at best, it could be called a bubble.
