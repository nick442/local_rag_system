">10,000 dollars more, on average, across 12 million employees, bro. That adds up. That's about 5 dollars an hour more. Not much. But the upward mobility in government jobs is severely lacking, so I'm not sure if that $5.00 an hour makes up for their inability to get raises. I do hope you have proof for that number, however. I call monopolized (or psuedo-monopolized) corporations, and high end CEOs rent seekers, because they seek to make FAR more than they need to even thrive. The government doesn't make far more than it needs to thrive. It does, however, mishandle funds and delivers them to . . . CORPORATIONS that lobby them! Corporations are beholden to only their shareholders. If I were to let corporations run the roads, you can be sure that only the most profitable areas would have roads, and most roads would have tolls. Those without the means or without big corporations nearby would have to do with trails. The gateway to success that Big Government is supposedly closing down with subsidies would ACTUALLY be closed down because private industry would control your methods of transportation, communication, education, and survival itself. To reduce competition, they would keep you low, and suck off your funds. They would call it fair because you CHOSE to live where you do, and not work hard enough, neglecting their own part in establishing the high wall that you cannot get over. What do YOU think would happen if Big Government was sent away and our basic necessities were privatized? Do you have illusions of ""free market"" dancing in your dreams? Where companies compete rather than collude? Do you imagine roads to the far reaches of the nation being kept up, or just the roads important for goods and people with money? I want to know what you imagine the endgame will look like."
