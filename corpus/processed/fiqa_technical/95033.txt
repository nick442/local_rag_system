It really is a stupid term. What comes to mind with the term underwater? drowning, sunk boats, cars and other property and flooding. All really stressful and damaging. Underwater in mortgages, means you owe more than your house is worth, .. ER your home's value dropped below the value of your mortgage. It does suck but it doesnt mean they are behind on their mortgage and doesnt suck as much as people who are behind. it isnt really something to worry about except for the future when you resell. For a lot of people it is just something they can ignore. In theory, they should get a lower tax bill. Underwater just seems like an odd term for something like your home value dropping below the price your paid for it. If you buy a new car, you can pretty much claim to be underwater as you drive it off the lot, because your car simply isnt worth what you paid for it the second it becomes used. not saying it isnt an interesting stat, or that it is of no concern, it's just an odd term. To me it is more fitting for people behind in their payments than for people whose property lost value. (and yeah i get it is more dire for investors and somewhat for landlords but not always)
