"I'd suggest that Bitcoin is not ""just"" anything. If wealthy Chinese have found it useful, good for them. If enterprising Venezuelan manage to afford basic necessities with it, that's great too. Both of those are just use cases in the end. There have been others, and there will be more. It remains to be seen just how draconian capital controls need to be to really prevent Bitcoin from being used in those environments. But if anybody can do draconian, it's probably China, so this will be a great experiment of sort, if they still have the stomach for that kind of thing. If you're arguing that the market value of bitcoin is only rising because of one use case, I invite you to [look at this historical bitcoin price chart](https://bitcoincharts.com/charts/bitstampUSD#rg2920ztgSzm1g10zm2g25zvzl), spot the period of activity for your given use case, and estimate how the price action was influenced over that period by this use case. Then contrast it with the part of the graph outside of your chosen period, and make sure your idea adequately explains both parts."
