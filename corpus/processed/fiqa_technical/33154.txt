"> This is probably the single most clueless statement I've read about business, ever.. actually made me laugh. Because you are clueless? Do you know how many ads I see on the internet every day? Zero. I see Zero ads. And every person I talk to sees Zero ads, because I tell them about ad blockers. And they tell their friends, and so on and so on. I advertise on reddit, and I pay for ""impressions"". So every 1k impressions I pay a certain amount. But they have no way of knowing if those impressions are actually seen or not, they can use sophisticated scripts to determine if the ads are blocked but there are sophisticated ad blockers designed to block just those kinds of things. This is a war, and in the end ad blockers are going to win this war. So why would anyone pay for advertising? Advertising is dead. It's dying. And if marketers can't find a new way to make money they will die with it."
