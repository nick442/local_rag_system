can I ask career advices from you ? I had 3 years experience in boutique fund management, have done my cfa, and now am about to enroll in master of finance in one of the top unis in UK Always want to be a trader, but my biggest concern is that since I am slightly older (mid to late 20s), I will be competing with younger fresh grad when applying for analyst program, do you think this is an advantage or disadvantage, or does it matter at all ? Also if you can pick a region for a trading career, which is best and why ? thank you
