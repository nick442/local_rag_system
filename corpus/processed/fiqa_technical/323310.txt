> Try it! Deposit a check or buy with a credit card and scribble something unrelated as a signature! The deposit or credit card transaction will go through. About that you are correct, however during any sort of forensic investigation they are going to ask to see a signature receipt if one is available. > For decades, retailers never compared signatures on credit cards to the person's signature. No that isn't true. Retailers are required by many card processing vendors to send in a signed receipt. This is changing, because employees are lazy, and retailers don't care about their customers at all so they don't bother enforcing any standards on their minimum wage register jockeys. However many of them are still required to send signed receipts in. When I was younger I worked at a store that would not get paid by the bank if it did not send in a signed receipt for every transaction. Go on, try walking away without signing your credit card receipt at stores where they present it for signature, and see what happens. > I know what I am talking about because I deal with credit cards a lot, professionally, in IT. You and everyone else. Big deal. Different credit card processors have different requirements for their customers (merchants). > The credit card companies don't really care. I think the real lesson here is **nobody cares**. Not the banks, not the credit card companies, and not the merchants. The only thing any of them give a fuck about is keeping the money flowing, especially into their own wallets, and if that means customers get ripped off sometimes because of inadequate protections, so what. My only point is, if I have one at all, **merchants _should_ care** about protecting the customer, and **customers _should_ care** about what protections are in place to prevent fraud. **PIN numbers are fine** as an authentication method, **but they should be completely shielded from view** by people standing in line or cameras overhead.
