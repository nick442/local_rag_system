I refuse to buy any Groupon vouchers because it would make me feel so *dirty* screwing over the companies the vouchers are for. Just because I am not *personally* the conman ripping them off using dubious sales techniques, it does not make it any better. People say to me that it is their own fault, so tough luck on them. I promise to say the same thing when their mother is ripped off by a pushy salesman at her front door.
