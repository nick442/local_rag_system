How would you calculate separate margins in the following example: You have a fairly volatile component that is basically a commodity that you have sold as a standalone product for years. You then begin offering a value-add service of programming these components so users can buy the basic component or a ready to go preprogrammed version. Sales can also offer sales deals at their discretion. I just want to spitball some ideas.
