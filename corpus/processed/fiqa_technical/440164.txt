"If your income stream goes up, it would usually increase both your ""income"" term and your ""assets"" term since that money sits in your bank account as an asset. (Even more likely a combination of assets and expenses go up if you have cost associated with the increase in income.) In this case, they balance in the equation and your equity doesn't change. The question as you posed it is true mathematically, but the ""paradox"" happens because you're not taking into account where the money form the increased income falls in other terms of the equation."
