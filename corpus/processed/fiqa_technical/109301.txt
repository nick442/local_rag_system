Will they still create programming catered to an 8th grade education and watered down enough for children to watch? That's why I quit tv and cable. What the fuck am I watching shows made for teenagers for? No hard science, no hard news, and not a single person talks like a regular human. It's fucking bizarre seeing it at this point. A weird world of nonsense.
