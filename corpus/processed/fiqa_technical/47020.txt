"There's truth to that, although I'm not sure if the ratio is quite 6 to 1. It IS true that they are processing foreclosures much slower now after the robo-signing fiasco, and also that there is some justification for letting a house stay occupied rather than sit empty. I disagree with your assertion that ""smart banks"" would dump massive amounts of property at a loss. Selling their inventory quickly would slim their balance sheet (which they been trying to do) and let huge losses flow through their income statement. That's a bad way to achieve a good end, even though the changes are purely accounting and not economic. That's not smart for any business, operating in a vacuum and independent of competition, whether a bank or a retailer. Should GM and Ford sell their backlogs of cars at a massive loss now, just to get rid of the property? There's underlying, economic, intrinsic value. Properties in the biggest bust markets, like LV and Phoenix, are down 2/3rds from the prices around 05/06; one would argue that the prices are so low they fail to make economic sense. Florida was a huge bust market, but today's NY Times (http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/28/us/miami-courts-free-spending-brazilians.html?_r=1&scp=2&sq=brazil&st=cse) talks about a recovery in property values, fueled by Brazilians. Given that cities like Vancouver and throughout the SF Bay Area have seen property prices recover, in part fueled by foreign purchasers (mostly China, etc) why would a bank not want to hold onto the property until it gets a good price?"
