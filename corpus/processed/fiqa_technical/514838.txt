I've been to SeaWorld San Diego once as a kid and as a kid I believed that SeaWorld cared for marine life and this was their way to help promote understanding for it. From what I've read and from what SeaWorld has done and is doing about it, the picture does not look pretty. No matter how much goodwill they do and how much they change everything.. It'll always come down to two factors, the image of SeaWorld being tarnished and all the changes taking away the magic of SeaWorld. It would fare better under the hands of a different owner. Legoland San Diego has fared better and has not had a PR disaster happened while the park has operated. Maybe the owner of Legoland San Diego should take over SeaWorld, they'll fare better at turning it around and running it.
