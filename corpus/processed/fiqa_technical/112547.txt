Hopefully we can correct some of these balances though. Our brains evolved for fight or flight style survival, not for living in modern urban environments. I can certainly see the benefit for an artificial brain to be able to make perfect math calculations for instance, something our human brain struggles with. If we can't find ways to overcome these issues, what is the point really.
