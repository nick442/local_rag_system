> But it's just a tool, it's not artificially intelligent, and it will only do as well as people's willingness to bound its search by an appropriate set of constraints. Exactly right. Because a business doesn't think. The agents, or representatives of the business do. The business itself as an organization or entity isn't a person, so it isn't able to make a decision. The business will just follow orders given to it like a puppet. One might think when watching a puppet show that the evil character stabbing the others is evil.. But it's just a puppet. It's the puppeteer that's operating the strings.
