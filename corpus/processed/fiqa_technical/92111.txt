When Obama came into office we were running a roughly $1.16 trillion deficit, and when he left office it was only $600 billion. Yes, the total debt kept going up because he never got that number to zero, but he made a lot of progress. Trump, by contrast, seems determined to blow up the deficit, just has the last Republican president did. And the Republican before that. And the Republican before that.. EDIT: Thanks for the gold kind stranger!
