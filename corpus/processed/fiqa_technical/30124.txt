> If you aren't ivy league you have no hope of getting on wall st in front office. BB associate here coming in to confirm this. Front office wall st is comprised of 2 types of people. 1* Tier 1 (Ivy, 4.0 UChicago, London School of Econ, 4.0 NYU, etc) undergrads who didn't make it into HF's and are looking for exp so they can move into HF realm. These are usually interns from junior/sr summer that are now on 2 year analyst rotation programs (usually 4 rotations of 6 months). 2* MBA/MS and CFA Charterholders with past experience in capital markets. This means they have already been working at a BB whether it was in relationship management or middle office.
