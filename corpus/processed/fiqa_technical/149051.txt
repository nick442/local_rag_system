Yeah, but the direct flight to Seattle is too long from the east coast. Southern California has Hollywood, Amazon video studio +1, 3 major ports of America because they are on the top 20 ports of America (( LA, long Beach and san Diego) (LA is number 1, long Beach is 2, 3 is new York and New Jersey Port authority means MULTIPLE PORTS and 4 is the Seattle and Tacoma authority which also means the same shit.)) Good universities, California tech, ucla and usc to name a few. They are close to companies like boeing, Raytheon and Lockheed,(all withing 50 miles of each other from some reason)East coast is good for finance but is good a headquarters have to mean its close to their other branches? East coast is good only known for their investment banking. I don't know I'm just some drunk guy on the internet. But in my opinion California is the 6th? largest economy in the world and yes, if a yuppie city is willing to give you 5 billion to go there massive amount of resources compared to Memphis, New Jersey and what not just because a hq has to close to whatðŸ˜µ? Think farther, go south, Mexico and south America. Hq1 USA and Canada and hq2 south America..
