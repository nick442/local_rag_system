Yea I'm super confused about why this is being touted as some revenge fantasy on corporate overlords, or something. She was hired to do a job, got paid to do it, and was no longer required to do the job. I don't still get residual paychecks from my first job out of college, and they don't get to call me up and ask me to do a process analysis- I did my job and now I do another one (for someone else). What obligation does an organization have to an employee beyond a paycheck..?
