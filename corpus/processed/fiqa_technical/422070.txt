Don't feel bad. The last time I did this was 2008. It was an inter-office competition. We started a 6 month run around July. $100,000 each. Same rules as this game only longer. Well this thing happening around September/October in 2008 that caused all hell to break lose on the markets, you might have heard about it. The winner at the end only lost $20,000. I had lost $60,000. We had one guy who only had around $10,000 LEFT. Playing this game while the whole market imploded really drove home how royally FUCKED a lot of people were. Made for a tangible experience of all the junk you saw on the news.
