You know, I shop local when I can, but for big mass produced stuff I often go the Amazon route. It is quicker, easier, and usually cheaper. I wouldn't use this in a store I liked a lot, but a Best Buy type, where they have displays laid out to a scientific formula, christmas music playing two months early to Pavlov me into a shipping mood, and set their TVs on HD then non-HD channels in a effort into making me perceive a bigger quality difference than actually exists? It is nice to have a counter tactic. Scan scan scan I say..
