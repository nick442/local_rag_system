I went to school for something I was interested in. Also, if you looked at what pay rates some people I went to school with took jobs at, you would stick with what works for you just like me. I have no desire to start at $60000 or something. IT certifications can matter in some cases, and I have my share of them, but they again represent a synthetic benchmark. Lots of people are good test takers and can't do things in the real world. A recent project of one of my companies was to install a wired network for 12 users that would allow each user basically unrestricted internet access in a site with a connection with a single external IP address. It was required that the clients not be able to communicate with each other. If you saw the idiotic solution and ridiculous configuration using (that didn't work) using mac address filtering and detection and whatever that a CCNA who used to work for me tried, you would go crazy. Why not just have individual VLANs individually PATed to the external internet interface with no routing between them, and then broken out at the main switch? The config to do that is very very simple and works perfectly. I think it took me 5 minutes to pull out of my ear. To me, experience and prior work trump all.
