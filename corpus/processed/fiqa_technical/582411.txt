A few questions: 1) Are there any 'low emission' fuels or technologies that are even remotely viable for long-haul air travel, within the next decade or two? Asking people to travel less is silly, and punishing companies for CO2 emissions when there is no alternative is also silly, so I hope these regulations are trying to encourage some sort of 'positive' behaviour? 2) Is there any evidence that CO2 credits or offsets are actually helpful? Is there any proof that it's not just a money laundering scam?
