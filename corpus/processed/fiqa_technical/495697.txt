On your first point, banks (or any large company) is primarily concerned with maintaining profits. I'm very familiar with this dynamic in media with broadcast vs streaming. They will try hard to charge as much as possible to sustain the stock price, while competitors will be as aggressive as possible to capture market share. This always happens with every industry that gets disrupted. The new entrants will permanently eat away at bank profits, whether they adapt or not. No comment on your second point. Possibly true, but I don't personally assume that yet.
