NY State schooler here. It is indeed who you know. Some of my better connected compatriots are in the IBDs of Goldman, JP, etc. They are brilliant but so are the harvards and yales that interviewed alongside them. It ultimately came down to speaking with people on a regular basis who can go up to bat for you. Even my back office finance internship was via a resume submission on behalf of my B-School's dean (Which I am eternally grateful for the vote of confidence on his part) The programs them selves often don't matter. Hell, sometimes they like a good novelty (ala the juliard student in my intern class). Example in point: Our tiny honors program churns us out with bloomberg certifications, extensive excel experience, and even a few models and pitches under our belts, which as I've gathered from my interactions with other interns, puts us a few steps ahead of the curve. But it's all for naught if we can't network our way into an interviewer's hot seat. **tl;dr My point here is that if there is a will there is a way. Some times it just takes the will of a few others to create that way.**
