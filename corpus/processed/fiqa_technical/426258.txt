Over the top consumerism is excessive- that's why I shop at *Whole Foods*, the lab-created result of three decades of false advertising and marketing trend studying that attempts to fleece people out of their money by inventing fake positive qualities for their food that have no real benefit, but justify us charging $3/lb more for it. I'm not a dumb *consumer* like all those *other* people- how could things that say FRESH on them be targeted towards consumers?
