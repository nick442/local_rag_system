"Thank you for the response, no they didn't ask for anything from anyone, and I certainly didn't give them any information. I was very skeptical but I don't want to be close minded. They claim that they never charge anyone for their mentorship. And the fact they talked so much about pyramid schemes really put me on edge. I guess I just would like to know if anyone else knew about this ""$10 billion in revenue private company."" I read the article you posted and I didn't get that impression. The speaker said he was donating time because he felt like that was important for himself and his wife, to give back to the community. Anyways I will give it a chance, cautiously, and worst case scenario it's an opportunity to network. Thanks for the insight!"
