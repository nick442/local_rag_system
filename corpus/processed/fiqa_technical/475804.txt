If they default and try to stay in the Euro, they will be shut out of any chance of financing but they will be obliged to conduct business in a currency that they cannot afford. Their businesses will close, unemployment rise until they have no option to stay in the Euro. Instead of that, they will reissue the Peseta, Lira, Drachma, etc. and then devalue. That will allow their real estate, tourism and manufacturing to be very competitive. If they could stay in the Euro after default they would starve, but I don't think they could stay, even if they wanted to because they'd be expelled by Germany.
