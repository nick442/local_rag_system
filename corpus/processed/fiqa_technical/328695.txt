">It's dishonest to equate a purely digital media entity to a broadcaster. Despite nothing dishonest about it. You are doing nothing but splitting hairs here, why is beyond me. >The argument does not stand up to scrutiny If that was the case you would been able to refute it, you yet to been able to do so. All you have done is make claims of my logic being faulty, which you have totally and utterly failed to show. >I think this is the point that I refrain from rubbing your nose in not just your logical mistake lol what mistake? You act like you are this logical wiz, and yet I have successfully taking down your logic while you totally failed to destruct mine. All you are doing now argument wise is ""but but but but but"". You don't realize what Vice releases on their website is representative of all of their content. Claiming they have good content when their content is on the level of Buzzfeed is outright laughable to say the least. You claim your well verse in your media readings, but yet you continue to defend Vice as being quality content tooth and nail despite agreeing with me that the article was crap. I highly doubt you can link me an article you think is high quality from Vice."
