"I love how Japan faces how freaking depressing life can be for men in certain respects head-on. You can cuddle with a girl, if you're willing to pay. You can talk to a girl, if you're willing to pay. It's not that life is much different in the US, but the notion that this would be acceptable at all is non-existent. Still, there seriously needs to be a ""make your life not suck"" class or something. I'd way rather talk to a girl who was actually interested than one who I had to pay just to talk to me (this is at a ""girl bar"", a bar where you pay girls to talk to you)."
