I have friends in Denver, once upon a time they could afford the suburbs nearby but prices have to growing too fast for even their tech incomes to afford it. There are cheap, less decent areas but gentrification will sky rocket the costs even without Amazon. In reality, wherever Amazon chooses to settle their HQ2, prices will rise. By how much depends on how little is in the area already.
