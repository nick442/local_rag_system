Majority of Pacific countries have relationship with North Korea, including trade. There are also a lot of regional group and treaty that Trump can't just run rough shot without being literally thrown out of the group. But I for one want to see Trump tries to cut off trade with China. That would be hilarious. (ie. US consumer will have to live with90's technology overnight. in some cases, no TV, no iphone, no laptop, no garment, no walmart/amazon junk)
