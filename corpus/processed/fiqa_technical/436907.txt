I hear what you are saying, but it doesn't seem to ring true. The subsidies again may exacerbate the issue, but they aren't CAUSING the issue. The real issue is the regulatory burden in your explanation here, not the subsidies. But again, I think the large companies' abilities to sue forever, or buy out of existence, the smaller companies, or to gain regulation that does disproportionately favor the larger companies, is the real issue, then. Subsidies are only a catalyst to help the process go faster.
