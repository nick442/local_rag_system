>I haven't been in /politics since the election where anyone that didn't support Hillary was either downvoted into oblivion or banned. Okay, but that doesnt mean it hasnt happened. >Once CTR took over /politics, any posts supporting Bernie or criticizing Hillary's past were trashed. These are all just cognitive bias. While they do support and tend to be this way it is not as extreme as you are making it out to be. Maybe if I have time I'll link 10-15 comments that illustrates why there are many exceptions to what youre saying. There are no exception on for the r/T_Ds -- it is 100% tow the line or silence/ban. >Maybe it's changed since then now that the election money has dried up and CTR doesn't have the funds to pay shills to full-time manage /politics. This is just speculation. We can say definitively however that r/T_Ds havent changes.
