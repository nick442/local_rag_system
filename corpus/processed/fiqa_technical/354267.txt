> My town has less than 150k people and for the eclipse we are predicting a million visitors in the area. On past history this estimate could be right (although 1m seems like a lot) or it could be wildly inaccurate. During the 1999 eclipse there were areas in Cornwall that were gridlocked with traffic and planned events that saw hardly any attendance; visitors to Lake Balafon in Hungary had to watch it from a traffic jam. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse_of_August_11,_1999
