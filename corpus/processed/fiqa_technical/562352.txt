What is more practical for Finance, R or Python? I understand committing time to Python will mean I have a language that is versatile and useable across multiple areas of a business, and will give me skill that is alternative to finance, but is it a bit impractical if I don't ever see myself needing to develop software and would rather focus on data analysis which R is great for? Edit: Also, I have done introductory R programming in university (It was a 1 semester course so not extensive). So it would be less time committed.
