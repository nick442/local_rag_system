Math and Econ double here. At a BB now. Will heading back to get MS in computational (quant) finance soon. Here's my advice. Learn the following: * Differential Equations, * Linear Algebra, * Numerical Analysis, * Stochastic Calculus. The statistics used are more complex than econometrics. Econometrics is a very vague and rough introduction to Linear Algebra and mediocre (at best) depth in statistics. Statistics you use are not going to be basic business stat. It will be stochastic calculus which is why you need to have a firm grasp of multivariate calculus [calc 3] and proficiency with MatLab, Maple, or another equivalent. Every info session I've attended regarding MS Finance programs has the expectation of a coursework background that has reached at least Calc 3 and Linear Algebra. Some programs will admit based on GMAT/GRE quant score but will require you to take those math courses in first semester (and thus sacrifice a possible dual program option and limit your concentrations). Other programs aren't as lenient.. Just depends on the school you plan on attending. As per your question, calculus comes into play in just about every single real world valuation you will do, regardless the product. **edit:** and down votes for real world advice? nice r/finance
