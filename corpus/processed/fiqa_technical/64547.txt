A federal or state regulator has ordered that the RDFI cannot participate in the ACH network, or the RDFI's participation has been limited in some capacity. You need to contact the RDFI for more details..ask for their ACH operations group. The RDFI is the institution receiving the ACH transaction. It could be either the debit side or credit side. It is not the institution originating the ACH transaction, which is the ODFI. The entire RDFI institution might be restricted for an extremely poor audit, or rampant suspect money laundering or terrorist funding. Specific accounts at the RDFI might be limited for a variety of reasons, including freezing the account for suspicious activity (money laundering or terrorist funding), court order for impending legal proceedings, IRS levies for nonpayment of taxes, or perhaps child support delinquency. I am making an educated guess on the reasons.
