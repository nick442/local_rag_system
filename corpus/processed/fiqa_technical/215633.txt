I still think the biggest thing they have to get right is getting rid of the driver and making cars perfectly autonomous. If that happens, there could be a serious disruption to the market because the price of an Uber/Lyft/etc. just dropped in half I would bet. I don't doubt that Ford, GM, Tesla can make the cars, but it's going to take a little while to make economic sense to just abandon driving a car. The other thing this article leaves out is the demand for non-gasoline products growing globally -- think plastics, aromatics, jet fuel, and asphalt. Thus, I don't see Big Oil crashing in the next 5-10 years, but it may become a tighter market with a few big players as margins get thinner and companies go bankrupt.
