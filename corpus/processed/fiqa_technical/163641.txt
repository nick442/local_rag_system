Leverage comes in many forms. You'll learn about things like operational leverage, financial leverage, and total leverage throughout school. In the real world, tier 1 capital ratio has become the most commonly scrutinized because it is essentially a ratio of the core equity capital of a firm divided by the risk weighted assets (assets multiplied by a credit weighting which for most banks now a days is using the standard of Basel 2.5 and moving towards Basel III). The multiples you talked about were references to the reciprocal of this formula. You could reciprocate the T1C ratio and get a whole number that is the multiplier. This multiplier would show for every 1$ in core capital, how much the firm held in risk weighted assets. The 30x number would have represented a tier 1 cap of 3.33%. The concept behind it being, a 10% growth in risk weighted assets with a 3.33% T1CR would result in a 300% growth in core equity capital value. As proven in 2008, it is a double edge blade and works the same way in both directions.
