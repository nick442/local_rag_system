"Exactly it. I declared bankruptcy over 7 years ago. I was in a bad situation - I was laid off, the jobs in Salt Lake dried up after the Olympics, everything was in the crapper. I found new work - in California. Went off and lived there alone for six months while my wife and children stayed behind. We used all of our savings keeping up on the mortgage, paying bills - and living like paupers. Once my wife came down, we knew we couldn't afford a place in CA *and* our home, so we rented it out. To people who didn't pay their rent for six months, and we were so far away we couldn't just fly back to make it happen. And my wife was pregnant this whole time. Finally, because of my wife, we gave in. And I felt awful. I had failed my family, I had failed my wife - and I felt like I had failed myself. I remember being so ashamed I told *no one* for almost 6 years. Until I found out I wasn't the only one. Until I had close friends tell me of their troubles. I hadn't been overly irresponsible, I hadn't been buying up big TVs and junk. I was just trying to make a living, did good work - and just got caught up in bad luck. But the shame didn't go away. And it's only now, when I know more, when I see companies declare bankruptcy, or very wealthy people do so, that I realize that yeah - I have to take care of my shit, and I do everything I can for that. But at the same time, if bad stuff happens, I shouldn't spend my life beating up on myself because I had ""shit happen."" Shit happens. Everybody should have a second chance to try again. Learn from the mistakes you made, plan better if you can, and realize that the best laid plans of might and men oft go awry. Try again, and hopefully it'll work out better next time."
