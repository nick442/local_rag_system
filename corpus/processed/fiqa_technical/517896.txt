"STUDY FINDS.. Just LOL. Let me guess, the group that suddenly had more money relative to their peers experienced a wealth effect? Now see if you can find the logical flaw in applying that same math to an entire group rather than a subset of a group. These ""studies"" on basic income are so logically challenged it's hard not to laugh at these ignoramuses. There have always been a large percentage of economists who actually suck at economics, but recently it seems the rest of the establishment has just taken to ignoring them rather than telling them that they are intellectual children, as they would in the past. Where are the adults? Now mod me into oblivion kids. Remember: don't respond. Just use that down arrow to silence anyone who says something that upsets you. It's the millennial way. LOL"
