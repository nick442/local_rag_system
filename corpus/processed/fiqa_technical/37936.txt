Don't worry! Once we get those for profit prisons up and running Americans will have no problem finding jobs. Just expand what counts as illegal, crack down on illegal activity, and millions upon millions of Americans will be employed. At $.50/hr. And the added bonus is that we'll be able to compete with third-world labor! Who says there isn't a plan to make America competitive on the world labor market? .. now if you'll excuse me I'm going to go bury my tinfoil hat. It's scaring me.
