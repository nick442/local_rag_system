Well, yes. They aren't jailbreaking peoples phones in China either. This is about providing a platform for people to download software that can add an extra layer of security. They didn't remove anything from their phone's innate capabilities nor did they invade people using the phones privacy. They just removed a banned item from the store. If they break open someone's phone at the behest of the Chinese government, then I think there is cause for backlash.
