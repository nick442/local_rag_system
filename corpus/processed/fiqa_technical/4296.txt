I tried Aldi the other day..hated it. Very little brand selection (everything is Aldi-owned brands) and meat prices were about the same as Kroger's. I bought the Aldi-owned brands of foods I normally get at Walmart/Kroger and was not happy with the tastes of many of them. I much prefer the branded options at Walmart and Kroger for my grocery shopping.
