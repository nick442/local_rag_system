I mean the current account has four parts - goods trade, services trade, “primary” income (this used to just be investment income) and “secondary” incomes (this used to be just remittance and cash flows, Mexico has a lot of these). By definition, if you have a trade deficit but current account surplus it comes from primary/secondary income. I’m not sure if it’s crisis mode - a true BoP shock is much more likely to come from having a lot of foreigners owning portfolio assets based on your country (ie Germans owning Spanish bonds sell the bonds, so Spain now has less money for imports).
