As I have told you, again and again and again, the government is actively enabling the wealthy with anti-competitive policies. I literally spelled it out for you in my previous comment. The wealthy get wealthier through cronyism. Look at Amazon. Besos is quickly becoming the wealthiest man in the world, if he isn't already. How'd he get there, you might ask? https://www.postaltimes.com/postalnews/why-the-post-office-gives-amazon-special-delivery/ This is not gonna get solved by giving the government more power. We've given the government so much power already and its only gotten worse!
