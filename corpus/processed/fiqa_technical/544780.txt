"I'll leave you with this, since you're so desperate to prove that you aren't racist. If you want people to not think you're racist, then STOP SAYING FALSE RACIST THINGS. STOP SAYING ISLAM SHOULD BE ILLEGAL. STOP GROUPING A BILLION PEOPLE IN WITH A HANDFUL OF EXTREMISTS. STOP DEFENDING YOUR RACISM UNDER THE GUISE OF ""SAFETY"". PICK UP A BOOK AND JUST STOP SAYING STUPID RACIST THINGS. Its really not hard. Just don't be a dick to a billion people that you know absolutely nothing about."
