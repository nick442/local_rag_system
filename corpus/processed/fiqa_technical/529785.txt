> It's often the minimum wage employees that I see abused the worst, they are easily replaceable by their employer and punishment for violating workers rights is a slap on the wrist. Yeah, this is a good point. I think the experience skews significantly as you go down the skill-level / prestige of the job. An interesting observation (maybe) would be that this mostly applies to people who are *only just* above minimum wage, such as Walmart employees. They get paid enough that it would be hard to find another retail job at the same pay level. But certainly not enough to be considered well-off. True minimum wage earners who I've known typically don't give even the smallest shit about their employer. They switch employers in the blink of an eye, and at the slightest provocation. Minimum wage jobs are as much a commodity for the employees, as minimum-wage employees are to the company. > A lot of this was to get over a peak of work.. However now I have been granted some flexibility Well said. My situation is very similar. The company communicates their needs to me, and so I'm well aware of when peaks are likely to occur, and of the consequences of missing deadlines, etc. It rarely comes as a surprise.
