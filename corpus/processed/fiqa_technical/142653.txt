"The monthly bill should reduce as required by Loan A no longer requiring payment. This will occur only when Loan A is fully payed off, not before. If you're going to do this, make sure you tell them that any extra money is principal reduction, and not ""prepayment"" Lets say you do pay off loan A, and you continue to pay $11 a month. If you specify ""principle reduction"" for the $1 extra, they must reduce the loan balance by $1. If you do not specify, or you specify ""prepayment"", they ""may"" apply $0.20 to principal reduction and $0.80 to interest."
