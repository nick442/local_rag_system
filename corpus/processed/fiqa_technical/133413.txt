"> Wall St ripped off retail investors pretty good ""Ripped off"" ? How about ""retail investors did not sufficiently research and think about the company, invested poorly"" Seriously, a 20 minute thought experiment pre-IPO of ""is Facebook worth $100bn, and does it have growth prospects?"" ought to immediately discount the stock. The smart money was always on ""short it as soon as you can"" If you're making investment decisions like ""Hey, I know what that company is. I use facebook!"" you deserve to lose money."
