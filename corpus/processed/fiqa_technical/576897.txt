"Now asking if college is worth it? That's not the question that should be asked. Higher education and extended training are always a benefit at any point in life when it's of high quality. The question that should be asked is, ""why is the cost of college as high as it is?"" When I went to college to get my Bachelors, a semester at my state university cost $940 bucks US (this was in the early to mid 90s). Twenty years later, that same education cost $6,500 per semester. The main difference between these periods is that borrowing for school is now standard practice (much less so in the 90s). Any time you need to borrow to pay for something, you're going to overpay just because you have access to credit and can keep borrowing when someone hands you a bill. Today, kids borrow for college because they don't have much choice if their parents didn't save enough or stopped supporting them right out of high school. And if you have this level of debt right out of college, your hands will be tied for decades - it affects things like first home buying and disposable income spending. The only way to drive the cost of college down is to plan ahead and pay with cash - and to do that, you need to have enough luck to be born to parents who care enough to help with your future. If schools know you can't or won't borrow to pay for an education, they adjust."
