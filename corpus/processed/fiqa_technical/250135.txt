They may still lose; tho I consider it unlikely, as the best scenario for that would require increasing the number of players in the wireless market. Some sort of open-access rule for infrastructure built by companies granted spectrum licenses would be a good start, but seems unlikely given how much more sway corporations have over the state than consumers.
