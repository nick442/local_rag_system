A constant answer which I see brought up in a variety of forums is the complaint that schools don't teach money management (budgeting) and how to do taxes. Another good bit of information would be to take apart a credit card statement, show how the interest is calculated, etc. I'd start with those topics, which might take a bit of research on your part (many adults don't understand many of these concepts either), and then build from there. I remember the first time I was able to go from a list of transactions on a credit card statement, and calculate the interest owed from the average daily balance, and it was like a light coming on. Most people use these concepts on a regular basis, but have no conception of what's going on beneath the surface.
