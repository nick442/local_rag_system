"The term for money owed to you by a company would be a credit balance. Consider, when an item is credited to your account, it's in your favor. Whereas, money you owe to a company may be referred to simply as a balance, or balance owing, or less frequently a debit balance. A related term balance due would be the payment you owe in the current period, i.e. not representative of the entire amount owed. I don't think the terms ""positive balance"" or ""negative balance"" are considered idiomatic in business. Rather, accounting terms like debit and credit have taken hold instead â€“ and are often a source of confusion. But I suggest that if you have a negative balance on a credit card, it's a credit balance in your favor. Unless they mix it up."
