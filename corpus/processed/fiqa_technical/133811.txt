"I don't disagree with you. I was merely trying to assert that the channels you mentioned deserve the credit for their content, and that in a lot of ways those shows aren't what people typically have described as ""tv"" shows. When I think of ""tv"" I tend to think of network content, because historically speaking they were the ones with the most prominence, and they still have the most sway over the direction of the medium today. A power they have used to seemingly decay said medium with increasingly thoughtless programming."
