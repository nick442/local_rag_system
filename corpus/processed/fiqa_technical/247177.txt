I retired when I was 48 without financial worries and with enough money to travel and eat out whenever I want. The thought that I was making my salary and paying the taxes I did while other struggling to get by had to pay taxes at all was ridiculous to me. Especially when I had earned enough to stop paying into social security. That seemed doubly ridiculous. I'm happy for those who work longer because they want to, but for those who simply don't earn enough, this is so sad.
