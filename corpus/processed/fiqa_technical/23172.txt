So if my father signed up for the military at age 18, became an officer, worked 30 years and spent very little (buying used cars eating in & having roommates) to afford to buy me a car and pay for my education. An education Where I worked worked extremely hard at to become a civil engineer with a high GPA and spent at least 100 hours perfecting my resume and interview skills to get a high paying entry level job where I replicate my fathers habits while being single, choosing to not have children until I build capital, learn to invest in my free time, and live off of 35% of my income by leveraging wealth and having roommates. Your telling me that since I am able to retire at age 35 on my current plan it is all due to luck? Luck? Sure I'm thankful that my dad sacrificed and gave me a privileged life with free education but that wasn't luck, that's hard god damn work and I thank him everyday what he did for me. To tell me it's luck is borderline crazy. If you didn't have what I stated above be the person who works his ass off so your kids can have the privilege to retire at 40 if they make SMART choices. Or better yet, borrow capital to get an education that pays you 60,000 pay it back and retire at 40? Stop trying to act like it's impossible. Investing isn't gambling, it's foolish to think so. If you invest in index funds it will grow over a long period of time. The medical scenario is completely different and is mostly caused due to a lack of a free market and insurance system. This is effed and should be fixed as a wealthy society. ^^^^there are ways to ensure you have medical coverage but again, it's difficult and should be made easier.
