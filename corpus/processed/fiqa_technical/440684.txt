"It is precisely this kind of oversimplification that makes me laugh. I run a startup (well in it for more than 4 years now) and finding programmers is a grind. Yes we get some resumes, most could barely type, let alone write some decent code. As for paying ""higher salaries"", sure I wish I could pay $1MM starting salaries, yachts, and 3 months off and all that..you know how this ends. If you wish to checkout the fact yourself, stop parroting the Lou Dobbs line and start your own company or go work for a startup. Ye shall see."
