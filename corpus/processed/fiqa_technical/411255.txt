"You need to elaborate a bit. ""Cash"" just means physical currency, ie. bills and coins. But cash is just an investment in currency. Wealth is the ownership of *something*. Could be real estate, could be stocks, could be gold. But your wealth has to be *somewhere*. And every investment has its risks and returns. Imagine you had a million USD in the bank. And then ISIS carried out nuclear attacks on Chicago, LA, and New York. You would still have a million USD, but you would be a lot less wealthy."
