> why not lower the minimum wage? Because businesses and landlords won't suddenly lower their prices. They will just take the profits. As a white collar worker earning far above minimum wage who owns middle class investment property, I will probably win if minimum wages rise. My rents will rise more than my maintenance costs + property tax rise. As my interest rate is fixed, the inflationary pressures will effectively lower my debt. I know who won't win, and that's the minimum wage workers who receive the pay rise. Most of their consumption is provided by minimum wage worker intensive areas. Fast Food, supermarkets, gas, utilities. All areas that will rise, and what's left will be eaten up by rent rises. Minimum wage should be fixed to inflation, rising annually by CPI. Then we should stop talking about minimum wages at all, and focus on how we can assist in upward mobility.
