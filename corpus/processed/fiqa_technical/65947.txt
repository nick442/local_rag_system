It's funny you bring up trains. If you actually go back and look at the history of trains during the rise of the automobile you'll find that their practices were far worse than anything Hollywood is doing. Remember when the government was busting up all the Big Trusts (high school History)? The Railroad Trust was fucking with everything from ticket prices, to worker's rights, and yes even regulations to squeeze as much as they could before their ultimate demise. It's a sad lesson because if they had learned to function alongside cars and their actual value of facilitating transportation we wouldn't have the transportation crisis we face now. Your analogy is depressingly apt. Crowdfunding, a drop in media prices, and 1-login-anywhere-on-demand media services (a la Steam) are definitely sure to crop up over the years and I totally agree that *these* will combat piracy more than anything the government can do. Because honestly I think the U.S. Government pulls this kind of bullshit just to show the American public that they are relevant. Just because they are on the completely wrong side of the argument doesn't mean donors aren't popping up out of nowhere, their offices and websites aren't flooded with traffic, and they aren't benefiting from the press. If they aren't manufacturing retarded schemes like this, they'll have to get back to the real work of voting about the logos on our currency.
