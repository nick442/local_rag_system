Lol Go where? They are doing nothing but expanding and have a cult like following with an extremely loyal customer base. If a city doesn't have one, they have people waiting to line up and shop at one. People drive hours just to shop at one. There really isn't another store brand you could say this about. I think they'll be more then fine, and I'm not an even an avid fan though I do shop there once a month or more. I've traveled around the country living in multiple locations they recently expanded to and their location choices and small footprint with huge sales make them highly successful.
