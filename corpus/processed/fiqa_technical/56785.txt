Around 22 million bitcoin maximum. I can't remember full details but it's designed to dish out 12.5 coins every 10 minutes on average. Sometimes it might be 10 seconds, sometimes an hour, and half every 4 years until 22 million it just halved so in about 3.5 years you will get 6.25. Now to SEND bitcoin you can bribe miners and pay a few cents to jump the line, so you get your 12.5 + the donated coin. As for eth it's confusing shit. Bitcoin is like a virtual dollar, eth you can 'transform' into other things to do things I don't know what it's for. Research 'dao' and eth. Dao was some sort of contract system using eth.
