It’s fascinating that you think you’re right, but more so that you think you are speaking well know truths. It’s fascinating because there are hundreds of studies done on each of these topics and there’s been no definitive answer. Some studies say it has nothing to do with race, some studies say it has nothing to do with socioeconomic factors, and some say “we don’t know.” Yet here you are, standing as the racial expert of Reddit spouting what you believe is the truth everyone is ignoring. And perhaps what takes more guts is that you are doing it and pretending to have a wealth of evidence for your belief! Just save us all the time and admit you’re a racist. Don’t bullshit and pretend to be well read on such complex issues. Just say “I’m a racist and I hate black people” and move on. Don’t insult our intelligence by pretending to be smart.
