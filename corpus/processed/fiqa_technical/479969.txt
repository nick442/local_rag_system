Wow! This is an excellent article! Written by someone who actually bothered to check their facts, and understands the Focus Fusion process. I have been following Eric Lerner's DPF approach for many years, and am convinced that all attempts to create steady-state fusion machines is a total waste of time and money. Having a pulsed device which converts x-rays straight to electricity is roughly a million times better than having a retarded steam cycle attached to your multi-billion dollar Fusion reactor that can't ever break even, and can't ever do anything except produce lots and lots of Ph.D.s. A DPF pulsed reactor can be built into a shipping container, and become the holy grail of energy generation. It is indeed a shame that DPF has seen such pathetic funding.
