Sort of. I mean that even though TV generally sucks, and there are better alternatives, the average human may not be smart enough to care. TV is easy, something they're used to, and requires no energy to watch or make any changes. So, they may eventually catch on, but the TV industry will probably be able to stay a step or two ahead of them simply because it's not too hard to do, and nothing will happen too fast. I learned about investing back in the dot com days. I invested too heavily in high tech thinking it was really happening, and I was somewhat right, but it just didn't happen as quickly as we all thought, and a lot of companies went broke because they had no short-term income or plan, and ran out of capital. Now I know there's more to it than simply knowing which way the wind blows. You also need to know about butterflies and hurricanes so to speak. Timing is important, and shorting stocks can be profitable unless it takes too long, and you end up being forced to act before you're ready.
