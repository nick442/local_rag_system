"Sorry to say it this blunt, but you really have no idea about his true nature. You know what others wrote or said about him. Not him personally. I think this whole debate is rather moronic. We have a lot of hearsay about all the ""bad"" things Jobs did. Think about your own life. Think about how people who don't like you could easily describe your actions as evil. Not even by lying, just by leaving out certain parts. I don't know if Jobs was an asshole or a nice guy. And I don't give a shit. Why would I? I think this debate is mostly about linkbait and fanboys going at each other. (""My hero is the best!"", ""No, your hero is evil!"") Please don't drag this idiotic debate here."
