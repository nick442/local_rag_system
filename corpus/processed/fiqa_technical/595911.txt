I'm a smoker and I don't see one moral point of view here one way or another, as people often try to paint it. Would I vote for it? No, I don't want to pay more taxes. Has the CDC issued reports that every $1 increase in cigarette prices leads to a significant decrease in smoking? Yep. Take it how you will. It's up to the people, that's what democracy is about.
