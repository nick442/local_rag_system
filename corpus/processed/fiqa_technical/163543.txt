I mean its probably not set like that in a cynical sense, though yeah any time its coming from a private company it'll be as expensive as they think people can pay without losing their shit. ps. things that are supposed to be human rights should just be on up to a certain amount. Obviously you don't want needless waste of resources so it'd be good to have some kind of overage fines.
