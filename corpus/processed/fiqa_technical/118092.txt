I feel like there is a lot of media and confirmation bias involved. I'm not necessarily disagreeing with you but it's easy to point out examples where moves to cut costs have ended badly. It's unlikely to make the news if cost cutting moves are successful. For example let's say with the Schlitz example, the new process they used was in fact successful and didn't result in a loss of quality. That wouldn't be as big in the news as screwing up would be.
