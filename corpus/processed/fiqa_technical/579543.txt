Amazon Prime 2 day delivery is mostly the white vans driven by outsourced contractors. I'm sure there are area's where Amazon hasn't leased the sprinter vans yet and the contracted company uses whatever types of vehicles they normally use. Prime Now 2 hour delivery is Amazon Flex drivers, which is just normal people with an app similar to Uber. Can be any type of vehicle. (source: I've done both) On the other side, non-prime deliveries are usually from UPS, FedX, or USPS. Amazon Delivers to their facilities in pre-sorted bulk. (edit) I don't understand this article since Amazon has been doing this exact thing for over a year here in the midwest. I'm assuming they are just rebranding it now and probably expanding it to attract more contractors.
