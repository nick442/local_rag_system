"They most likely decided that you weren't worth the time to respond to, so don't expect a response. Also, remember that receiving no response is the same as them answering you and saying ""No."" Anyone with any amount of influence tends to have a lot of people vying for said influence. They don't have time to respond to every Jane, Dick, and Harry who contacts them. If the offer doesn't sound good on the first pass, the deal is lost. Your best bet is to go with a Plan B that doesn't involve them."
