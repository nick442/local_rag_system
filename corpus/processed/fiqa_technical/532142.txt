Patents yes. The machines, devices, component staging, and manufacturing processes are not. An immense amount of planning, foresight, troubleshooting skills, and other manufacturing challenges are not patented. Tesla already has paid the bill for that and went thru the growing pains of complex manufacturing. China gets ALL of that for free. Hell, just seeing a photo of the inside of a plant or the layout could benefit the competition.
