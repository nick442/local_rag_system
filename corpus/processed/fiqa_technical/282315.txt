I don't think the skeptical position is fairly represented most of the time. Few people doubt that CO2 is a greenhouse gas, and that man contributes to it's increase. What appears to be increasingly doubtful is the positive feedback postulated by the climate models. The simple explanation is probably the correct one. The models are significantly overestimating future temperature increases.
