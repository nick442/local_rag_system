"> You can't claim this is government retribution I didn't. > just because it's a big company or a ""government-sized"" action. I'm saying I don't think non-government should be in the position to be able to do government-sized actions, at least not negative and targeted ones. > PayPal is not a utility. The Internet is not yet a utility everywhere. Are petrol stations? Non-emergency medical care? (that last one may fall under some other must-serve definition). Let's say the two ISPs in the US decide that since there's no net neutrality they'll throttle your business to 1 bit per week. Maybe because of your views. Maybe because you compete with them, it's their business and they don't have to justify it. > You're making incorrect comparisons. I don't think that I am. OK, let's say all non-utilities are allowed to deny access based on political views of customers or other arbitrary things. What if all the paint stores decided that you are a horrible person, so you are not allowed to buy paint. Eventually your house rots because you need to repaint it every now and then, and now you're homeless. Seems unlikely that they all would do this, right? Oh, but when you look at PayPal and VISA/MasterCard, there's like one. Or two. What if the quorum of bitcoin transactory things do it? It's not that many, as I understand it. Denying legal use of money in a de facto monopoly is to me not morally better than denying legal use of money in a public utility monopoly."
