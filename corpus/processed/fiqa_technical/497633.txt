"I hate that filmmaker Kip Anderson. Every movie he makes is a vegan trap. He starts by talking about how red meat and dairy are bad, then eggs are bad, oh and of course fish are also bad. The only healthy way to eat of course is being a vegan. The pseudo science is painful to listen to. He basically tries to say casein protein is as bad as heroin. And they call milk ""cow puss"". I turned it off as soon as they called cheese ""basically coagulated cow puss"". He takes advantage of the fact that people take health documentaries pretty seriously, and uses it to push his personal agenda. Really disappointing because nothing I've seen in any of his movies has any credibility once I realized how much he was stretching the facts. There are tons of better documentaries that will have a similar affect on people but with WAY better science. These days I see tons of people saying they watched a Netflix doc and changed their eating habits. Fed Up was pretty great. Also Sugar Coated is one of my favorite food docs ever."
