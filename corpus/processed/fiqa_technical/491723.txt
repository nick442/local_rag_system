"Does this make sense to anyone? It estimated hes made 300 mil in the last fight but lets say its a conservative 100 mil. 4% in the market after inflation is 4mil a year. If it was the 300 mil then it'd be 12 mil hes giving up. Probably more. And that's just the first year, not compounded. So he expects me to believe that he's making ""smart investments"" in his strip club but not putting the money in the market. This makes zero sense."
