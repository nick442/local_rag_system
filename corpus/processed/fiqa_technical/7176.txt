I skimmed the paper rather quickly. It's interesting I guess, but if you haven't taken a junior level college course in finance you'll be lost. I fail to see any actionable advice from the article however. It simply goes over how pretty much how most of how we perceive WACC, Betas, and Equity Premiums are wrong. We are wrong in their actual definitions and we are wrong in how they are calculated. I'm disappointed the author did not propose a solution though. Even if he is right, you can't rewrite 'wrong' textbooks if you have no idea what the right answer is.
