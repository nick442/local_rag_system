The problem is that's all Chipotle has going for it.. a big ass burrito with a handful of toppings. Once you eat there twice you've pretty much had all Chipotle has to offer unless you'd like to try a burrito in a bowl. Not exactly a well thought out menu. I don't see Chipotle standing the test of time unless they expand their menu and market. It's just boring after a couple times. You get way too much food also so any claim to being healthy is BS.
