KPMG's website has: For the purposes of taxation, how is an individual defined as a resident of Sweden? An individual is considered a resident in Sweden for tax purposes if one of the following three conditions is met: The individual has his/her real home and dwelling in Sweden. The individual stays in Sweden during a lengthy period of time (a permanent sojourn) and with only occasional interruptions. There is no legal definition of permanent sojourn, but a stay of six months or more will in general constitute residency. So, given your I am presently resident in Sweden and this from the above website: There is no legal definition of permanent sojourn, but a stay of six months or more will in general constitute residency. I believe you are liable for Swedish income tax. I am not an accountant. This is just speculation based on a Google search. Get paid advice! :-)
