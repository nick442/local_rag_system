"I had to look up the word contentious real quick. Thank you for that, added it to my lexicon! That makes a lot of sense. Thus far, I was fortunate enough to only view videos from renowned economists and study from textbooks. I feel like this adds another layer to this entire field. Until now, all the problems I read in the books were fixed, and under the assumption of the ""perfect market."" I had almost forgotten that people react to incentives. (Advocate a certain stance because it's beneficial to you, not necessarily the majority) It's funny how learning little things affect so much of my perspective! Thank you."
