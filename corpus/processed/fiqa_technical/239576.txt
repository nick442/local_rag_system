Handwritten IOUs are are traded pretty routinely at my friday-night poker game. This is also the bit I didn't get. The shoe maker would accept Loddars, but not the Friday Night IOUs, so how can you say they are worth the same? I guess the IOUs are more risky than the Loddars for the shoe maker to accept, since the poker player might wake up on Saturday and not remember writing the IOU. I could borrow 12 Loddars from the Tailor, then buy shoes now. Now the Tailor might not know that I plan to pay him back with money from the IOU.. because that doesn't matter? If he lent me 12 Loddars, he did so on my ability to produce 12 Loddars in the future, not just on whether I will get the IOU back. So you're saying that this spreading out of the risk makes the difference between the IOUs and Loddars fade away, to the point where the promise of a Loddar from the Tailor is only as risky as actually having a Loddar, since a Loddar is only a promise of a Loddar from Ben in the first place?
