Well I see a lot of pushback against the many people in here that are suggesting failing a drug test due to weed means that the person is addicted and basically a junkie who's goal in life is to get wasted. If that really is the business owner mindset then I really have no sympathy for them. If you're argument is solely based on insurance that is one thing but I have no interest in supporting some kind of bullshit moralizing based off of anti drug propaganda.
