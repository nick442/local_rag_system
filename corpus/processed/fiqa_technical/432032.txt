"I agree with you halfsies. Marketing yes, but to paraphrase Steve Jobs, marketing isn't how you get the word out, it's what you build to start with. The vast majority of startups have ideas which could only be profitable in a universe other than our own. In the real world, outside of venture capital, the people with these ideas would understand that, at best, they are only hobbies. Nobody would give them a loan. But venture capitalists will throw money at anything with chunky nerd glasses and an iPad, so they are ""enabled"". Then they waste years of their lives on things which should rightly have never lived to begin with. It's desperately sad."
