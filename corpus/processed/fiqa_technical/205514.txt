yes, the really good weed requires a bit of know how to grow properly.. but i have known and hung out with people that grow plants, and i have been to their houses and they have shown me how they trim and clip things, and they show me how they put a light to trick the plant into thinking that it is still daylight out, etc.. but in the end, weed aint worth what is being charged for it.. no way.. i am in texas now, and the price here is similar to what i paid at the weed club in california, in cali i paid a mininum of ten dollars per gram and it was possible to spend approx forty dollars per gram, and i think that they even had some that was more than that.. but i want to promise you that your average joe can figure out how to get his plants growing just fine, especially when all he has to do is to trim and water it, as opposed to having to give some criminal ten dollars for enough to make a couple of cigarettes/joints of it. fk paying for weed. and, just for the record, i dont really give a fk why people pay for cigarettes. cigarettes are just plain retarded.
