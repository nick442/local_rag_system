I worked at Autozone many years. Many crappy parts had lifetime warranties and helped us grow. Sometimes one year warranty parts from NAPA were better. THE WARRANTY WAS A MARKETING SCHEME. Hyundai can not possibly feature the reliability of Toyota who has been continually improving since WWII. I drove the first Hyundai, the Excel in 1986. They have improved a lot. The look is great, The warranty is great. The marketing is 24/7/365.Impressive.
