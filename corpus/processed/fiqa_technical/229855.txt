"This would be my guess, too. My town has a small family-owned bowling alley that's been here for decades. It was cutting hours, getting a little run-down, and in danger of closing. There was talk in the community of saving it, after they announced they would be closing, and it stayed open a few more months, then they announced the closing again, once the boom in business died back down. Someone else stepped in and partially bought it out, but I doubt it will stay open much longer. All in all, they couldn't afford to keep it open. The largest nearby town has a huge bowling alley, affiliated with a large chain, and runs a bunch of bowling leagues and tournaments. There are also 2 ""family fun"" places nearby that offer bowling with electronic scoring and all and a bunch of games for the kids. They couldn't compete with all that when they just had the same old facilities as always, but they couldn't afford to upgrade the place to draw more business either."
