It's great that vets have loans available to the that offer additional protections, but in a seller's market, which we are completely in, buyers should realize they need to make their offers as attractive as possible with as few barriers as possible. I recently put in an offer on a house, but was outbid by another offer to only have the seller come back a week later willing to accept my offer for 5K less because the other offer was a VA loan and they didn't want to deal with the hassle. That being said, affordability aside, vets can get non-VA loans, so it's not like they have no options to make themselves more appealing to sellers.
