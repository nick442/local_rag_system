Is that even legal to pull out of a deal like that? I'd assume they'd have made an agreement (between the underwriter and the buyer) during the roadshow. This event I would think has large negative impacts on the firm. It delays their IPO, (provided that they try again) and it makes investors wary of reinvesting in their second IPO (oxymoron. haha). Furthermore, if the biotech firm decides to openly publish the details of this deal (which i assume they'd have to if they want to have a chance at having a successful IPO) someone is going to be labeled as having dealt in bad faith. I understand that underwriters mostly operate on a best-efforts basis, but I don't think they can come out of this deal without facing some consequences.
