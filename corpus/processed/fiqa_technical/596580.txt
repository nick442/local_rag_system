If you can't run a business and compensate your workers substantially better than the Chinese, your business should be closed and liquidated. Want a low-tax paradise with few regulations? Go to Mississippi. Want a state with no teachers' unions? Welcome to Alabama, home of the worst schools in the nation. Want to live in a high-tax hell with coddled workers? Go to Germany, which has enjoyed some of the greatest prosperity for well over a century, in spite of having a social welfare system in place since Bismarck. I'm sympathetic to the argument that taxes and benefits will hurt the business owners, but only at much higher levels than we see today. Those who can't cut it under even the modest constraints of the minimum wage and Obamacare should not be in business anyway, because they suck. (And I'm leaving out that Obamacare will save most small-to-medium business money.) If we must cut workers' pay and benefits to the levels of the Chinese worker, then we suck as a society and deserve a housecleaning of the dead weight in our ownership class.
