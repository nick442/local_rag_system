"Given his history it seems silly to give the benefit of the doubt. At the very least we should understand how poor form it is to make a joke like that as a public figure regardless. But its just one piece of evidence to support my argument. Personally I think pushing for the prosecution of cannabis again, and all of the terribly detrimental programs of the 80s is a far more compelling line of evidence. I also think the person I was responding to would not accept ""acting in ways that knowingly harm POC in a tremendously disproportionate manner from non-POC"" as evidence of racism."
