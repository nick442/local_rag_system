I wish that I could share the same positivity as you, but aerospace is going (I'm a mechanical engineer btw). Boeing has been our biggest airplane producer and the only company to rival airbus, but their production (and design) is being moved to China. https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/lorenthompson/2015/09/23/boeing-to-build-its-first-offshore-plane-factory-in-china-as-ex-im-bank-withers/amp/ What you're talking about with computer tech still being stronger in the US vs China is a common misconception. Though we are a powerhouse worldwide in CS with people all over the world using sites like Facebook and google, China made a smart decision years ago to block these sites and have their own similar sites developed in country. These sites are every bit as powerful and almost as commonly used as their American counterparts. As far as the language and cultural barriers go this is a barrier that the Chinese are easily and quickly overcoming (just as Korea and Japan had done in the past). China is the biggest international market for consuming American made entertainment and Americans and Europeans are moving in the thousands to China to teach English and teach western customs.(my sister has been teaching English there for the last 3 years) Finally, the Trump bullshit. I guess you could say you're guess about his lasting effects on our country are as good as mine, but I think we could both agree that they wont be good.
