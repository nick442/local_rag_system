Where are you getting $12-$16 for a burger at Applebees or TGIFridays? Applebees has their prices on their website and it looks like their most expensive burger is $10.99. It seems TGIF may not post their prices online, but another website (restaurantmealprices.com) has prices listed ranging from $9.00-$12.50. Not saying either are culinary leaders by any stretch, but unless those numbers are wrong, a $11/$13 burger at Applebees/TGIF does not exist
