"Have your story down pat, when they ask ""So tell me about yourself"" or ""So tell me about this past position"" you should be able to speak confidently about it while not coming off as pre rehearsed When they ask ""So why this position"" have the usual corny answers ready, ie ""I've always had an interest in X and believe this would be an amazing opportunity to learn blah blah blah"". Mention how the job duties/description is also what you were looking for as you'll have exposure to different functions, even if the job is boring as fuck Smile/smirk if they try a funny joke, don't be afraid to BS with them I have some interview guides if you want to pm me an email address"
