Long Straddle: \\/ Assuming you're trying to straddle the spot price, it will be more expensive to set up than a strangle as options strikes near the spot are more costly. Any price movement will regain against what was spent to acquire the options. Long Strangle: \\_/ Assuming you're trying to strangle the spot price, it will be less expensive to set up than a straddle as the options strikes are away from the spot. It will require a larger price movement than the straddle to begin to regain value against what you spent, as there is a dead zone between the strikes where both expire worthless. The / is the gain from a price movement up from the increase in value of calls; the \\ is the gain from a price movement down from the increase in value of puts.
