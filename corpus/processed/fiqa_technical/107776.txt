It's as likely as seeing a Marvel Pixar movie, or Mickey Mouse on ESPN. The Walt Disney Company is very very big, composed of strong autonomous units. Asides from the occasional cross-promotion between ABC and ESPN for football and basketball games, there's very little crossover between each of it's respective parts. What's great about being owned by Disney is that you have enough money to do whatever you want.
