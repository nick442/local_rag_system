I don't get it. Are you saying they did commit fraud but it's hard to pin on any one person? You say there is little evidence there was fraud but that it's too hard to prove there was fraud. So what did they do if it wasn't fraud? This is what wikipedia says happened: >The subprime mortgage crisis arose from 'bundling' American subprime and American regular mortgages into MBSs which were traditionally isolated from, and sold in a separate market from prime loans. These 'bundles' of mixed (prime and subprime) mortgages were the basis asset-backed securities so the 'probable' rate of return looked superb (since subprime lenders pay higher premiums, and the loans were anyway secured against saleable real-estate, and so, theoretically 'could not fail'). If selling shit you know is bad but looks good to investors isn't fraud I don't know what is. >Fraud is deception deliberately practiced in order to secure unfair or unlawful gain.
