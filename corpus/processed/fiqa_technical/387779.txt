Approach her. Always stick up for yourself. She's fifteen feet away, so call her out on her bullshit. And don't hold it in until you explode. You should always verbally stick up for yourself. People telling you just to quit are big fucking pussies. It's the worst advice I could possibly imagine that everyone just blindly upvotes. Fight! Don't quit! Also, though, *do* be looking for another job.
