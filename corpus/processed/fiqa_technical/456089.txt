Oh sure. There is no accounting for what people prefer. Some women need to be needed to be happy and some need to not be needed to be happy. It's going to depend on the woman as well as the man whether the relationship is working. I am not sure how they will ever account for those differences (parent-child vs. peer-peer preferences in a relationship).
