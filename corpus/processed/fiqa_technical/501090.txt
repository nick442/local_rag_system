That is, again, very shortsighted if you. If you can quantify an influence, or give it good enough boundaries to account for the non-quantifiable, you can develop a much better system. Capitalism is imperfect both because perfect Capitalism can NEVER exist, and because Capitalism fails to account for its oppositional forces, most easily seen in the more “feeling” side of life, but also evident in the very fact that we are having this disagreement. You bring up Brownie Points again, which makes me think you only have two views: The way you were fed, guessing Staunch Republican, and the way you were told everyone else was bad: Touchy Feely, Special Snowflake, Brownie Points and Participation Trophies. All of that means you haven’t actually thought for YOURSELF! Otherwise it would be obvious that all these views are incorrect. Democrats, Republicans, and Libertarians all have it wrong because they are more interested in telling others how wrong they are than really looking at the problem. Gods forbid they even slightly agree with the other side on anything! We have a REAL trust issue here, between all sides. And a lot of that stems from this false idea that people are innately selfish. Selflessness of any form could not emerge from a purely selfish source. But I’ll be damned if there is any way to prove anything is selfless.
