"Your 401K (and IRA) is a legally distinct entity from yourself. In fact, it is a ""trust,"" and your Administrator is a ""trustee,"" while you are both creator and benefactor. This fact, and the 10% early withdrawal penalty, makes it immune from most judgments. The IRS can ""levy"" your 401K or IRA for back taxes, but must waive the 10% penalty (under the 1997 Tax Reform law). That gives them the power to do what most others can't. A ""tricky"" banker may persuade you to take money out of your 401K to pay the bank. If you do, s/he has won. But s/he can't go after your 401k."
