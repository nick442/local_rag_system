I shop at Costco, and here's my thinking. They must have some kind of computerized system of where things are in the store, right? Here's what you do. Hook that system up to the web site. Let customers browse the store virtually. That way you don't need to have employees helping customers find things. Customers can easily find where things are on their cell phones. You could even have customers request to be notified when certain items are rotated back into stock.
