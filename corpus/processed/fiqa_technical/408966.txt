Yeah, but how many 1970s gold bugs invested early? Paul strikes me as typical of the breed: reactive and reactionary. Probably acquired a stack of double eagles and gold stocks in 1975, at the peak of the Arab oil embargo inflation--as did others I know. Even worse, Paul's leveraged equities short fund would have destroyed him over the same period. So the unanswered critical question remains: when did he dive into gold and shorts?
