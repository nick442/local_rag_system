I suppose it depends on what you mean by replicate. I don't take his meaning as to be able to create a brain with real neurons and such (this is actually possible*). I take it to mean replicate the functionality of the brain as closely as possible. I've been tracking the progress of the Blue Brain project which is attempting to do just this via software abstraction and simulation. It's a lofty goal. I like lofty goals. I think they often accomplish more faster. But having said that, I think trying to do this with hardware without the abstraction is even more difficult because as you say, we don't completely understand how the brain works. It's much easier to write or adjust simulation code than it is to redo hardware. Of course, the simulation route is less efficient but it's more flexible as new theories and information are generated, you just revise the simulation software. *Have a baby or do something like this: http://www.physorg.com/news/2011-12-bioelectric-tadpoles-eyes-tail.html edit: would someone mind replying instead of just downvoting?
