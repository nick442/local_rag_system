There is some sense that negative interest rates make no sense, because then two things appear to happen Neither of these are true in reality. But then we are edging towards a deflationary time, during which the common understanding of money and what to do with money reverses. During deflation, spending is better (to an extent) because the buying power of money is less as time passes, so also saving is less worthwhile. But for the bond market (and your question), the reason why people are still investing in negative interest bonds, is that they are going to be looking to capital gain to make their money. Over time the bond price fluctuates and as the bond approaches maturity, the bond price equates to the face value minus whatever interest will be received, or in this plus whatever interest will need to be payed.
