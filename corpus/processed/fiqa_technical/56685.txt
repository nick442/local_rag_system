"> However, the reality is that we the minute we are born we benefit from living in a civilized society with services and infrastructure that was created by those who have paid taxes in the past. I didn't ask for those services or that infrastructure. When I go to vote (especially on referendums) I vote no for things like increased sales taxes for better roads and the like > Your example is faulty because it assumes you receive no benefit from the taxes that the government demands of you. Ok, does that make it moral if I come to your house with a gun and handcuffs, if I use the $100 I take from you and spend $5 of it on a sandwich that you eat? I'm not saying that things the government does aren't things that people need. Obviously people need to save for retirement and will need access to health care (SS/Medicare/Medicaid). However, a lot of these ""issues"" weren't really issues when they were implemented. They were also implemented in a very immoral manner. Regardless of that, our argument is who can do what better. > but that is what our elected leaders currently find of value. That means absolutely nothing to me, and it should mean absolutely nothing to you. Democracy is mob rule. Republic is near mob rule. In capitalism, my choice of product or service doesn't impede yours. I can choose Crest toothpaste and you can still get Colgate. I also have no ability to force you to buy Crest, at least no moral ability that is. However, choices in a Democracy/Republic are. Not only when I vote for candidate A, and you vote for candidate B, are our choices mutually exclusive, they are literally saying I think you should be forced to live under their rule/my beliefs. Which is immoral. To force someone to do anything is immoral, the only exception is if they put force upon you (self defense) > I am not sure where that number is coming from. I know at one point JEIDDO by itself spent over $1T in R&D on the IED problem. I said in the 2017 request, meaning 1 year. I got that from here: http://comptroller.defense.gov/Portals/45/Documents/defbudget/fy2017/FY2017_Budget_Request_Overview_Book.pdf on page 5-1 I will add, that I didn't see previously that it is part of the RDT&E budget which is ""Research, Development, Test, & Evaluation, which is almost $72 billion. That number does eclipse the original $12.5 billion that I quoted. However, in comparison to the private sector, I only named a few companies. The total R&D spend is still going to be bigger in the private sector. Just because you buddy use to work for people who made and designed drones for DOD/DTRA and now works for Amazon doesn't mean that without the military/DOD we wouldn't be where we are with drones. > Bernie Sanders This is just one article that I found rather quickly: https://www.vox.com/2016/3/4/11161616/bernie-sanders-tax-policy-center A lot of my income comes from trading stocks, a lot of the times I use options (or as he puts it Wall Street Speculation) The tax that he wants to impose on ""Wall Street Speculation"" was nothing more than fancy double speak for things like stock options/futures. Options are used by most 401(k) managers, pension planers, etc. Those taxes would have hurt everybody. It would have made the stock market less price efficient and less liquid. You know who it wouldn't have hurt? The people he intended to stop in the first place, people like George Soros. I believe it was in just 1 day Soros made over $1 billion by shorting the British Pound back in the 90's. I believe he also made a killing shorting if just before Brexit."
