This just isn't true. I could very easily do 'mobile development' because I've learn to do pretty much every other kind of development. But no company would ever hire me (or anyone like me) for mobile development because I don't have 'experience'. The same shit happens with computer languages. A Java programmer could easily learn C# but no company would ever hire them for it. It's an absurd system.
