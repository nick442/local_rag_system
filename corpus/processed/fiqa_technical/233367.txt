"Are you asking why you aren't entitled to money that someone gave you by mistake? I think the answer is obvious even if you don't like it. If you overpaid your taxes how would you feel if the Government said, ""Sorry, finder's keepers. It isn't OUR mistake you can't do math."" Your best course of action is to work with the agency to see if they will work out a payment plan so it isn't a big hit all at one time. They are likely to work with you since it was their mistaken advice that got you into the situation."
