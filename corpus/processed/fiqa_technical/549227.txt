Did I have a reading comprehension fail? What I got out of the article as the fact that they're shedding users, but nothing about *why*. It is a fairly deep question, their games were incredibly popular, and addictive, a few months ago. It could say something profound about the way people use casual games and social networks. Or maybe it because Zynga's method of doing A/B testing on minor variations of the game, then choosing the version that captured more of the ~~victim~~ user's time and testing another minor variation the next day, doesn't make their games entertaining for long. On the other hand, I'm pretty sure anyone who plays Farmville by choice is fundamentally immune to boredom.
