No, I didn't write anything about whether we should have invested in the interstates, just that comparing a public infrastructure project to private subsidy (a tax break has the same economic effect as a direct subsidy--more money circulating in the market, not tied up in government) is not an equal comparison. If you really want to push that button, I would argue that investment in public infrastructure is a better investment than giving tax breaks to corporations. Especially corporations like Foxconn, with a track record of not living up to promises like these.
