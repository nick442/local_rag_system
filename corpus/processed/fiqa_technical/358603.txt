"> How is putting a gun to a persons head and saying give me your money or else I will cuff you and put you in jail not stealing? I've had [other discussions about why taxes are not theft](https://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/6leb2o/missouri_republicans_lower_st_louis_minimum_wage/dju1jjp/). > If..they aren't disabled then they are just lazy. I think there are a whole lot of people who struggle to work but are neither. How about a single mother with young kids and no help? Someone raised on the street with no idea what it takes to get a job? Someone with general pain or fibromayalgia? Someone addicted to drugs or alcohol? Maybe just someone who just can't take control of his or her life because a lowered IQ caused by lead poisoning or poor nutrition as a child? I totally agree that a ""tough love"" approach is a great solution for lazy but if the person has a real problem or lacks the tools to succeed, then the approach is not only cruel but will push the person into what looks like from the outside as more irresponsible behavior."
