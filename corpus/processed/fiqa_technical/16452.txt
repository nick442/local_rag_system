Yes, and you get those benefits by having ECDSA end-entity (leaf) certs. The root and intermediate don't really matter; they (well, usually just the EE and intermediate) are simply sent along with the client certificate and the client does the calculations to verify the signature. Let's Encrypt has supported ECDSA leaf certs for some time. ECDSA roots and intermediates are still nice, but they mostly decrease the size of the certificate chain and lower the initial connection time a little bit.
