Well..not in my reality. Chipotle is very prevalent in all cities of America, it is owned by McDonald's. I'm sure all walks of life frequent the establishment, and I'm sure there are vastly different demographics depending on what region or city you are in. In Chicago where I am from it is mainly middle class whites and blacks that go to Chipotle, between the ages of 25 to 35. Yes, the majority of mexican food throughout America is horribly bad. There are lots of chain restaurants dotted throughout this country that use mexican food's simplicity to make a quick buck, sacrificing quality over profit. Chipotle profits simply because it is a quick and filling meal for people on lunch breaks. They have never broken our out of places that are work hubs in Chicago because people get real mexican food when they are in residential areas. The best gringo mexican restaurant IMHO is Xoco, it is owned by Rick Bayless...amazing food with lines that stretch a city block long
