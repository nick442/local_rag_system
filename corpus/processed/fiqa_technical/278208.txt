First of all, it's not the 1% that run things. It is more like the 0.1%. They run things because they run the government, not because they cannot be challenged in the market. We should expect the courts to be less corruptible because their proceedings take place in public, whereas the Executive bureaucracy and most of the Congressional machinations occur behind closed doors. Deals are made that we have no knowledge of. That is where the 0.1% operates. They are as afraid of the light of day as vampires. There is usually a cycle of wealth that lasts three or four generations unless that cycle is interrupted by collusion with the government. Europe's rich stayed rich because they became the government. Their thefts were sanctified by making them nobility and protecting them with the state. Look at the makeup of Obama's inner circle. It is the banking nobility. Those banks and banksters would all be broke now if they had not harnessed the government to steal from thee and me to give to them. Small government that debates everything in the open will not protect the very rich. Without government protection their wealth will return to the general pool in three generations.
