"> Despite the fact that this correlation between immigration and wages is well-documented Link does not go to proper documentation. Link goes to another article on the same site, with the title ""3 Reasons Why Mass Immigration Is Bad For The Economy"" and subtitle ""Is Immigration Good for the Economy? No, Not Always"". Please make up your minds. > The evidence suggests otherwise, including new data reported by Fox. It looks like this bit is the closest thing there to proper data: > Just how bad is it? According to the National Association of Home Builders, more than 56 percent of developers nationwide are reporting labor shortages. > NAHB says the problems started when the recession hit and domestic construction workers dropped out of the market to find other jobs. At the same time, immigrant workers went back to their home countries. But as the economy has picked up and the construction industry has heated up, those workers have remained missing. Yeah, that's not even close to as clear as they're making it out to be. > In fact, according to Ted Wilson of Residential Strategies Inc. construction costs have risen by 30% this year—the majority of which is due to higher wages and increased overtime pay. Heh. That Fox article says wages are about 60% of costs. A bit of math says that a 30% increase in costs that was due *entirely* to wage increases would mean wages had gone up by 50%. That's a missed opportunity by the article writers -- the headline really should say that wage-growth is ""up to 50%"". ;) (Math: given $100 costs, $60 would be labor. A 30% increase is +$30. If that's all from labor, it would have gone from $60 to $90, and 90 / 60 == 1.5, or a 50% increase.) . Also, back to the leading paragraph: > There is a strong correlation between immigration—particularly illegal immigration—and wages. This should be obvious to anyone familiar with the fundamental principle of supply and demand: more supply (workers) means lower prices (wages), and vice versa. There's an example of how it's nowhere near that simple at http://voxeu.org/article/impact-immigration-barriers-native-workers : > Many claim that immigrants negatively affect the labour market prospects of native workers in advanced countries. This column studies a large change in immigration restrictions in the US – the 1965 exclusion of almost half a million Mexican seasonal farm workers (braceros) from the US labour market. The bracero exclusion did not increase the employment or wages of native workers, and technology adoption was one of the adjustment channels. (Note I'm not saying *wrong* this time -- the VoxEU article is specifically about a case where there was existing technology available to replace the lost workers.)"
