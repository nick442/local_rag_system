> ive read that consumer spending stimulates an economy more than investment somewhere Investment is necessary for an economy to grow, as is consumer spending. Neither is more important. If you lack one of those, stimulating it will do more than stimulating the other. It's like a racing team saying the driver is more important than the car. In situations where everyone's cars are as good as they'll get, improving the driver is more important. In situations where the quality of cars differs, improving the car becomes more important. >Also, youhave the theory that decreasing the income gap helps society in many other ways There is strong speculation that that is the case. However, it's _100% fact_ that increasing everyone's wealth helps society much more. It's why you'd rather live today than in any more egalitarian point in our past. If tinkering with income inequality gets in the way of overall wealth creation, it will do more harm than good.
