Yes! One of his best and definitely his most prescient work. What Vonnegut describes is happening right now -- look at Facebook, roughly a ~100 billion dollar company with and about ~3500 employees. This is definitely the trend, generating a lot of value with few employees. What do we do about those left behind? I'm not sure, and Vonnegut definitely didn't give us the answer. I keep hoping that there's a few savvy entrprenuers out there who are going to figure out how to add new value by finding ways to gainfully employ the chronically unemployed.
