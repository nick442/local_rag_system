>But gold does have other uses. It is a metal that's used for jewelry, it has decorative value. Exchanging something for gold is like a caveman giving you a stone ax if you do some cave paintings for him. That's not quite the point. I was addressing a specific problem. I'm aware that it's more complex, hence my disclaimer of simplicity. But to address your point, not everyone is a goldsmith. Imagine if the medium was saltpeter. Of course someone's going to use it to make explosives, but most people are not in that line of work. To most people, gold has no use except as a store of value. Why is an identically designed plastic necklace so much cheaper than a gold one? Because as many uses as it has, plastic doesn't store value (some say intrinsically, I say artificially) the way gold does. >because they lack the manufacturing capacity to do so. Like I said, they can invest in factory expansion or new factory construction. To stick to the metaphor, they need to plant more apple trees. There may not be a million apples available, but if that's what the demand is -and why else would anyone offer a million apples- that's the potential market size (especially if the supply exists in China). So the farmer ought to increase his yield, thereby lowering his average cost to produce an apple. If he knows he can only plant 100 apple trees, he's not going to promise a million apples when asking for a loan to expand his orchard. EDIT: >with their nominal value that people agreed upon. The same phenomenon occurs in bullion currency.
