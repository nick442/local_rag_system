You 5 downvoters are literally the first people I've ever heard that are ostensibly pro high frequency trading. I still haven't heard a convincing argument that it's anything more than a parasite on the trading economy. Premise 1. High frequency traders earn billions of dollars. Premise 2. No goods or valuable services are produced. Where am I wrong? What is valuable about having a computer trade fractions of ownership of a company back and forth thousands of times a second?
