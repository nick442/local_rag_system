Republicans are of the idea that corporate profitability improves the lives of their constituency: If a company can spend less, they will produce a less expensive product, thereby improving consumers lives. They also believe that if a company improves profitability, this will result in higher workers incomes. *Don't laugh, now*. They actually believe this stuff. That it has been proven wrong over the last 5 decades is beside the point. Somehow the people who vote for Republican politicians have swallowed enough flavor-aid that they come back to the trough every two years and elect the same klepto's over and over.
