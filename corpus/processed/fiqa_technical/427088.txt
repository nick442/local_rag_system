Lucasfilm is more than just Star Wars, they also have Industrial Light and Magic (still one of the top VFX companies in the business) as well as Skywalker Sound and LucasArts, a respectable game division. Even if Lucasfilm didn't own Star Wars, they would still have enough valuable assets to justify a large purchase by Disney.
