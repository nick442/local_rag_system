As the premiums go up, so do the individuals subsidies because they are limited in how much they have to pay. John has to pay $450 if his total insurance costs $11k or $15 k. So, in effect, he will get more money. To pay for his increased insurance costs. This increases the overall costs to the taxpayers by millions of dollars. The money goes to the person to pay premiums instead of straight to insurance companies. The taxpayers would be much better off if the payments to insurance companies continue to prevent the raise in premiums. If Trump stops the payments, we are all going to pay more, except for those near the poverty level.
