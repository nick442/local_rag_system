You can get an SBA disaster loan to help cover costs. There are a few different kinds of loans. You have to live in a qualifying area to get one, which you likely do. There are physical disaster loans, which cover inventory, and that may help replace the flowers/plants. They also have EIDLs which you can use to help cover ongoing costs like fixed bills while you get back into business. Important to note these are loans, intended to be low-interest (or at least lower than a merchant cash advance or putting charges on credit cards), and do have to get paid back. There are hoops to jump through too, but they may be your best option, depending on your current financial situation. (You could also go to your local Small Business Development Center for help -- they have free resources and experts who can help you understand your options.) And when you get back up on your feet, get a business line of credit and business insurance so you have a backup plan and immediate access to capital for next time.
