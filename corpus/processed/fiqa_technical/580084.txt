You're assuming here that anything that is difficult to obtain will be highly desired. For me, value is largely determined by the buyer. Even if it takes the same effort to get 20 bushels of apples and a nugget of gold, if the majority of people find a nugget of gold to be worth 100 bushels, that will be the value of gold. Conversely, lets say there is an element buried deep in the earth that has no use whatsoever. Even if it takes the effort of 10 nuggets of gold, because nobody has any use for it, its value will be zero. Even though there is high effort to procure. I hope that clarifies your question of the exchange rate. It is determined by how much each party values the goods involved.
