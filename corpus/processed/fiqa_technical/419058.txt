The City of London economy is entirely dependent on total, unhindered access to the EU. Any blockages and it's over. No deal, no matter how good is going to replicate the City of London being in the EU. It may be a substantial financial centre for a few years after Brexit but that will very quickly evaporate. Libor would have been something keeping banks there, but with that now gone there is nothing else.
