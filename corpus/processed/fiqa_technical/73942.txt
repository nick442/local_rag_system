I was reading about the development of our modern highway system. Remember 'what's good for General Motors is good for America'? The car manufacturers had a lot to do with the building of the interstates. The problem is every new generations thinks the problems it sees are new when they are are really just the same ol' same ol' in news togs. Ultimately, much of our inclination to fuck up is down to our lives being so short. Nobody remembers.
