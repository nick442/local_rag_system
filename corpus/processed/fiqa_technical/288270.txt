Nah, they actually need them seriously, it's the main profit center for retail. The thing is, it's not that bad, the return shipping rates Amazon is giving to sellers are actually amazing. What I don't understand is why they can't offer those rates to us if we sell something and print the label from Amazon. Like they are ridiculously good. It would probably be cheaper for me to make a fake order and return for every shipment that I actually send out.
