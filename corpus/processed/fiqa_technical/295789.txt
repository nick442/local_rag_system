> walmart hires them because they have a low marginal utility undeserving of a higher wage. if they could get a higher wage somewhere else, they would. It's this way for every region, right? >i'm mad at the government for giving them aid. i don't think i should have control over a private business. but im supposed to have control over my government. .. >Wal-Mart is transferring the cost of labor onto the taxpayers. You are your government, it's why you vote for representatives to be assigned. So you are mad at yourself for not ensuring the prosperity of your own government.. Good commenting!
