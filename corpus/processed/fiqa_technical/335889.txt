"How does Equifax lose sales after a breech? Unless their data has been corrupted or falsified, it's still good to sell or charge for each credit pull. I think it's very different from say, a consumer facing organization like Sony or Target or Anthem. Although even in all 3 cases, you can argue they didn't lose much market share; all three are above their pre-hack prices. The goal is to allow the market to set a price on the value of security for the rest of the companies in the industry. I don't think the penalty should be ""death"" but considering their total assets is $10B, I don't think any fair penalty would allow the organization to survive. If they were Apple with $820B market cap, then yeah, the $70B would be a harsh and fair, but survivable penalty."
