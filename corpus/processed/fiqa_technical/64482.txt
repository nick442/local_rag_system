Well, a bombastic statement like 'capitalism is killing the planet' implies, for me, that the system has more than faults -- it is an utter failure and beyond any redeeming value. That's where I disagree. I'm not saying it is without fault. The goal of government is to patch over the fundamental problems with capitalism, particularly regulating free markets. You need to prevent externalities, and there are no bigger externalities than the future of the planet and the future of energy consumption. These are naturally tied together, and they should absolutely be regulated in the favor of humanity's future. It's a fallacy to say that capitalism is bad because it cannot thrive without government intervention because that option is not on the table. There is no option of 'not having a government'. At least, we don't consider any of them to be good options.
