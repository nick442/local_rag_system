Sure: right after you pay for all things that one NEEDS. What is left over should be for WANTS. Not the other way around. You are essentially telling people that do useful things that they should get paid very little..not a good message. It shouldn't be the outlier medical care, scientists, and engineers that are actually making the world a better place to get paid extremely well.
