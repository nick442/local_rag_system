Yes it is better than 0. I should be able to decide whether 3/hr is a waste of 8 hours of my day or not. Under a $15 min wage, a low skilled worker's actually minimum wage is $0. Someone can always choose to be unemployed regardless of what the minimum wage is, in this case the minimum wage has chosen it for them.
