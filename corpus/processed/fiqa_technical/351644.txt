The one starting for our team is an incoming senior with no internships or finance experience with the exception of their major. They are going to a small school which is one step up from a for profit university. The best job he had was working for a family flower business as a cashier. That's not to speak badly about him - he may very well be the best intern we've ever had. I think it mainly speaks to the ineptitude within our HR department who delayed recruiting so long most good candidates already had secured their internship.
