Basically you put down a deposit ($49-$200) and then you get a credit limit related to that card. I think it's got a 29% APR (might wanna double check that) and you have to have a checking account. Once you can show a good payment history with it and that you've had it for a little while it will open up more options with capital one and your credit in general. The one I have had an original credit limit of $300 and now has one of $700 after 7 months. Also, make sure you're going onto Credit Karma to get updates on your credit and see what they suggest you can work on.
