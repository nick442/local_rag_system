Yeah our government is an absolute mess now. I don't blame people for shaming the rich, as the corruption is visible in all sorts of industries. It is not, however, an inevitable consequence of capitalism. *Crony capitalism* is the result of a corrupt government, not unadulterated capitalism. If individual liberties were protected above all else, no businesses had any part to play in the ways in which they were governed, then we might just see a system that works. Not going to happen though.
