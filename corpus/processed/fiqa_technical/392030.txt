Have you ever heard of guilt by association? Also, just for the record and not because I give one fuck about whether you or anyone else thinks I'm a racist or not, I'm not a racist. Sorry to burst your bubble. I have more off-color friends than you probably do. Fortunately, they have their heads on straight and see the world and events for what they are, not clouded by some social justice warrior's idyllic hope for the future.
