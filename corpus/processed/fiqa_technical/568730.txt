>We collectively agree that a dollar has a certain value. That's it. We believe in money. Welcome to the collective delusion of fiat currency. You mean 12 richest families in charge of FED make you think it has value? Once you realize this, you'll soon understand how is US's everlasting involvement in (provoking) wars across the globe financed, where from, and most importantly why. Once other nations exclude US dollar as a valid currency (India, Russia and China have already), US dollar is going to be less and less valuable until it's worth nothing (as it actually is all along as it has no leverage). Maybe we better rebel against an inevitable doom of US economy now when you can actually use it to buy other commodities than wait to use them as firestarters 10-20 years down the road.
