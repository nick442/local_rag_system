"The whole process was so absurd though. They asked me to scan and submit my ID (which I did). Then they told me they couldn't accept it because it wasn't real and was ""obviously downloaded from the internet."" (lolwut.) I've never been so casually accused of identity theft before- that was interesting. So I took a picture of me holding the ID and sent that instead. Susan (the woman I was speaking with (dunno why I still remember that name)) said for ""security reasons"" I would have to wait three months and try again. Three months later they didn't even ask for ID."
