"You are correct. There's no reason for it even though UAVs can do it. An auto pilot isn't going to land you in the East River with much success. edit: You can kick the auto-pilot in at a pretty low altitude. Imagine accidentally activating the ""auto take off feature""? Yeesh! Plus, (as a former private pilot myself) the pilot is generally scanning the engine instruments for green while the throttles are pushed up."
