Well, there has to be a compromise, that's for sure. But surely you would agree that the people who take the lion's pie of the risk should also take the lion's pie of the profits. Just because one of their companies has turned profitable, it does not follow that somehow other stakeholders should now deserve a bigger piece of the pie. These shareholders probably have stakes in hundreds of other companies that failed, they lost their money, but the employees and executives there got paid, right? Well, you win some, you lose some. But again, when you take most of the risk, you have to take most of of the profits, because from an individual's perspective, you need to have a positive EV from all your investments on average, otherwise you wouldn't invest at all. Do you think that this would be better for all those workers?
