In the case of a warehouse, you'd think they would want air conditioning anyway to keep the products at a reasonable temperature. But certainly there's no reason you can't keep it cool enough in a warehouse for people to work safely. It doesn't have to be a perfect 72 degrees, but a heat index over 100 is obviously wrong if it can be avoided. If restaurants can do the same for their kitchens, they certainly should. There's no reason human beings should have to work in such conditions unless it's absolutely necessary.
