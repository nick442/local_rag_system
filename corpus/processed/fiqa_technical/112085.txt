Bullshit. Do you actually work with young people or is this just a caricature you've imagined up? About 90% of the young people I've worked with are hard workers and want to improve their knowledge and proficiency. I've seen virtually no evidence of people just showing up expecting a 6 figure salary because they have a bachelor's degree.
