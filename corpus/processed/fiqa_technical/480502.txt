Growers statewide have complained of a worsening labor shortage that has pushed wages up and driven them to recruit more foreign guest workers. In addition, new state rules that shorten the work week and require more overtime hours have added to costs, as have increased restrictions on the use of fumigants and other chemicals. Long story short.. We can't continue to pay slave wages for a 60hr work week while poisoning our workers, so we're out. I ain't eating ya damn berries anyhow. Bye Felicia.
