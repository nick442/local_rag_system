Well, you're obviously wrong. Anyone can start a hedge fund if they go through the proper ropes and get certified. I had my paperwork done through a company called Hedge Fund Dynamics, which I would never, ever recommend because they didn't deliver anything on time and I ended up starting at about the worst possible time. Other than that, all you need is a prime broker, and an outside accountant to do your taxes and reporting.
