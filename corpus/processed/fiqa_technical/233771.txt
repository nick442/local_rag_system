i have lots of friends overseas who go hiking out in jungles. i basically get to see their findings on deforestation and conversion of biodiverse jungle to oil palm plantations on a daily basis and its just depressing. but the only solution to this i can think of is population decrease or collapse to eliminate the demand. hundred million year old bidiversity wiped out extremely rapidly. species of gingers and ant plants and orchids and all sorts of beautiful alien looking flowers and plants with fantastic patterns on their leaves wiped out. animals like pangolins and tarsiers drowned out of their habitat as they turn valley into water reservoirs. id prefer 3/4ths of us were killed off than wiping out the earth's biodiversity.
