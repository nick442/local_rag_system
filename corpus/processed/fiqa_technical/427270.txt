I understand $14k/yr $5.4M max This isn't the right way to say it. Your dad has a $5.4 million estate tax exclusion that can be used for gift tax. In addition to that (not instead or as part of), he and his wife each have a $14k/year gift tax exclusion. So if you aren't paying for two years from today, you actually have three years of gift tax exclusion: 2017; 2018; 2019. So that's 3 * 2 * $14k = $84k that he (and his wife) can give you without using any of the estate tax exclusion. But I give my cousin/dad $430k from the mortgage According to this, you don't want your dad to give you any money. You want to pay the entire $430k. In that case, don't file gift tax forms. He's not giving you money. He's loaning you money. I agree with the others. The cleanest solution is for your cousin to loan you money to buy the house from your dad. Pay a lawyer (or have your cousin/dad do it) so that it's legally written as a mortgage and you can get your interest deduction. You start paying off the loan in two years. Until then, interest accrues. So instead of a $430k debt, you'd owe something like $470k. Maybe more if your cousin pays the property taxes as well. Your cousin is out $430k plus possibly property taxes, but apparently he can afford that. You have a house and a mortgage. Your dad has money to buy his Florida house. Note that if your dad wanted to give you money, he could. He could collect $346k from you (borrowed from your cousin) and give you $28k equity immediately and then two more payments in 2018 and 2019. But that assumes that $346k is enough for him to buy his Florida house. If not, just do the mortgage. He can give you money by check which you can send to your cousin if he wants to do that.
