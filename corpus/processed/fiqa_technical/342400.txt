Look I'm up for a dialogue, but I'd appreciate civility. If you look back at my responses on this post I've said multiple times that I'm willing to help people who help themselves. I'm also pointing out that 1.) this article 'slavery' aspect is off and 2.) I'm not 100% convinced she is doing all she can to further better herself (maybe she is but the article didn't convince me). I've said before I give her props for getting her ass off, good on her. And I'm all for helping out people (for a limited time) who actually deserve it and have actually worked hard for it. In the lead featured in the article sounds like she would be a very very good candidate. I am a generous person, I want to help people and I'm willing to do so. They just need to want help. My generosity ends when it becomes mandatory to support anyone who has made any number of bad decisions and is not deserving of my help (we can talk about who deserves help in more detail anytime). Should I support a family of people in which the parents keep pumping out kids, and the mom is a stat at home mom and the dad works at a slightly above minimum wage? No! Should I support single mom who chooses not to work, and mooches off friends and family? No Both of these cases may seem cherry picked, and while they are to an extent they are both real cases that I've/a personal friend have witnessed.
