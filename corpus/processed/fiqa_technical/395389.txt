> Can you learn how to evaluate operations efficiency without working at McKinsey? Of course, but what /u/aphorist212 isn't pointing out is the connections and influence that McKinsey alums in PE shops have. You hire someone from McKinsey not because they're smart, but because they know the right people. Why is this important in a PE shop? Well connected people can find ways to position a failing business for potential deals that will make it more successful. One other point: you don't need to turn that failing cafe into Starbucks. You just need to turn it into a cafe.
