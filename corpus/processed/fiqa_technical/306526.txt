I'm more interested in how they react in December when Tesla is supposed to making 10,000 units a month? If they can't hit production targets to clear out their backlog of sales orders then people will be waiting 4-5 years for their car. By that time other companies will have made big strides in electric vehicles and Tesla will begin to lose the prominence it has built which has caused it's shares to be so overvalued.
