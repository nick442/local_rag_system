Let me back up every point of advice I made for you: Albert Schweitzer: (my first point) > The three most important ways to lead people are:… by example… by example… by example. Albert Einstein: (also my first point) > Setting an example is not the main means of influencing others, it is the only means. Elon Musk: (my second point) > Pay attention to negative feedback, and solicit it, particularly from friends.

We appreciate when he's tough on us. He gets the best out of us. Doug Collins, Philadelphia 76ers Coach: (also my fourth point) > When your teammate looks you in the eye and holds you accountable, that’s the greatest kind of leadership there is. Seriously, I think you need to re-evaluate yourself. I think you have some self-esteem or self-confidence issues that are making you come off like a complete ass.
