The probably would not be used as much as you think. Currently some patents are nothing but assets. If a company has to spend money to keep a patent valid, patents go from assets to liabilities if they go unused. It's very different from trademarks. There is often no reason to get rid of existing brand and when it is done it is at a huge cost. Trademarks are also not held onto just for the sake preventing another company from using them.
