Santander - Spains largest bank was unable to fulfill it's obligation to finance the airline Norwegian's purchase of new planes. The contract was signed, but Santander had no money. They will now meet angry Norwegian's in court. If I had any money in any Spanish financial institution - bank, stocks, bonds, pension- or other funds - I would get them out today. They have been cooking their books. This is not Lehman Brothers, this is another Enron.
