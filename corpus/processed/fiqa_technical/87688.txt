"It seems like the argument is based in the idea that if you are going to be working 1 or even 2 minimum wage jobs while having trouble feeding/clothing/housing yourself, and ultimately have to leave the city because of that, how is that functionally different than not working? I live in San Francisco and there is a massive problem here with staffing in the service industry because restaurant employees can't afford to live within commuting distance of work. I do think that the ""something's gotta break"" line of logic is tough because we're talking about people's lives, but I understand the futility of working more than full time to not be able to afford a livelihood as well."
