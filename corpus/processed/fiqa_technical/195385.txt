Consider searching locally for a rewards checking account. There are some that must be opened nationally, but you can likely find a local bank (or perhaps even two) that offer these high yield checking accounts. They will generally pay more than the interest you have on those cards. Try This site to see if one is offered locally to you. These accounts typically require the following: In return you get higher interest rates, and most credit you ATM fees. The amount is generally capped between 10K to 25K on the high interest rate, and you'll generally receive a small rate for anything above that. I'm in a smaller city, and I have one local, and one within a 45 minute drive. If you have a job that allows for split direct deposits, this is even easier. We never have any trouble knocking out the required debit transactions, but you MUST look at the balance as being an emergency fund, rather than a checking fund with an available balance. If you find two near you, you can probably earn ~$130 a month in interest. That's way more than you pay monthly.. I vote to put it to work for you before paying it off.
