"I suspect the old people (who deserve to be shot for the state of these days) expect they'll die of natural causes before anyone born before 1970 learns that they've been handed the BILL for those parasites' retirement of USELESS consumerism. If you're going to have a government, they need a BASIC fundamental plan that WORKS. If they don't, they NEED to be overthrown, with violence, if necessary. However, who's to say what's ""viable"" given the ACTUAL history of the human species. If there is a god, or a benevolent nature, then the causes of this, ""winners"", need to be exterminated for the good of the species. The meek will NEVER ""win"", there is NO winning. The troglodytes who fly the ""flag"" of winning should be eliminated."
