You are 100% correct! This is because Unions are corrupt and even many Union members (no choice) hate them. But if the Government and the written law specifically protect workers rights, then it's the law. For example, the law says you can't employ children, you must pay minimum wage, can't discriminate, must pay social security, pay for injuries, etc, than this is the law and this is what happens. No less, no more.
