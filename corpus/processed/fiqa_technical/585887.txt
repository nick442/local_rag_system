A startup is a great place to work if it looks like it's going to have a future and YOU ARE ONE OF THE FOUNDERS. Otherwise? A startup is a good way to spend a good chunk of a decade working very long weeks, only to get shoved into a back room or laid off once they reach a certain size. Maybe if you're lucky you'll manage to stick around and have a bigger paycheck than most of your newly-hired peers. Maybe you'll even make most of what your new boss(es) that have been there a fifth as long as you and never pulled those 110 hour workweeks make. Of course, it's quite possible that simply working a second job during the time you were pulling mad hours and not getting OT for it would've made you just as much. On the other hand, if you're talking about your own startup? Sure, go for it. If it all works out, those extra hours will be well compensated in the future.
