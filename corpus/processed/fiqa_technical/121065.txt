"If you withdraw 401K then 10% penalty is applied. Also the amount you withdraw is considered as ""Income"" for that year. Whether you go back to India or Not, the amount is considered Income. Depending on the reason you state during withdraw, the Income tax (default @ 10%) might be ""withheld"" (Note: Sometime they may not withhold tax). If you are relocating to India, as per international tax rule (between India & US), when filing tax in India then you are supposed to show this as income (the 401K amount) and pay tax according to the total income including amount earned in India (could be upto 30%!!). If there was tax ""withheld"" in US, you can show it as International tax paid and pay the difference between 10% and your tax rate (upto 30%). If you are relocating to India, but still filing in US (it's possible) then 401K amount will be taxed at US tax rate (could be upto 35%). In either case (filing in India or US) the amount ""Withheld"" can be shown as tax paid, but yet you will pay the tax difference (could be 20% or 25% more) as per the income for that year. You are not supposed to pay tax in two countries for the same year, as per regulations (might end up with Audit in both country). Hope it helps!"
