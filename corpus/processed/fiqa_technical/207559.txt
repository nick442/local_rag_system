I did receive TurboTax's automatically generated confirmation of successfully completing tax filing electronically the day I did my tax on their web site. About 24 to 48 hours after you push the button at TurboTax the IRS should either confirm or reject the initial check of the tax documents. You should return to the TurboTax website to make sure the IRS has accepted the reutrn. Next review either the confirmation you received when you pushed the button or the information at the TurboTax site. It should specify when the money would be withdrawn. You were given options regarding payment method and date you want to make the payment. Many people who finish their tax paperwork early, but owe money wait until the last day to submit. Now it is possible to submit paperwork early but specify a date just before the deadline. Print out or even better save an electronic copy of the information at the TurboTax website. I have no idea how long it takes the IRS to actually pull the money from an account, once the day you specified has occurred. You have to plan as if the withdraw will happen on the exact date, but with millions of tax payers making transactions it may be delayed by a day or two.
