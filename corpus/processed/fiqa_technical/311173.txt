I work in equities at a buyside firm (think pension fund), and we have a pretty fit, west-coast style to the office. Most of my floor is probably in their 40s or 50s, and while there definitely are some less healthy traders and PMs, there's also a ton of work-health initiatives for people willing to seize them. Examples include standing desks (which the traders all use), an office gym, bike to work weeks, a department rowing team etc. The majority of people seem to be in at least average shape. Also, I feel like my office is very gender-diverse which I think really helps. It prevents the office culture from becoming too much of a boy's club where it's okay to just eat junk food all day.
