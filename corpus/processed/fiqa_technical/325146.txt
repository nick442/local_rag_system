Even though you are relocating and this is more open than a typical job move, the school's request is absurd. In most situations you expose yourself to a huge risk of being fired once you reveal you are looking to go elsewhere, since you are basically saying you are no longer committed to the job. They are asking you to take that risk with no guarantee they will hire you. This is the kind of thing that would make me question whether it is a good place to work.
