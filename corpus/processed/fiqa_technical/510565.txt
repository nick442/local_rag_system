"All the ""money"" you might receive from a pyramid scheme is ""ill-gotten gains"". Even if you didn't know it was a pyramid scheme. If through deliberate planning or dumb luck, you manage to get more money out of a pyramid scheme than you put in, the government can sue you for any ""profit"" you made. For example, in the Bernie Madoff scandal, more than 1,000 people, funds and institutions were sued for the excess money they made above their initial investment. Suffice to say, if you make enough ""profit"" from a pyramid scheme to materially change your life, it's only going to last until the scheme collapses and the government comes after you for the excess."
