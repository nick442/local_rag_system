"we clearly want something different in life. Thus inequality. Because it makes us both happier it is a fair and just inequality. Not sure if we need constant growth as long as our economy is constantly changing. It is kind of obvious that someone will invent/discover something and someone else will need to adapt afterwards. There always will be a first mover. I don't see how you can justify total equality and accept stagnation. That is some gangster attitude. We neither need perfect equality nor extreme inequality. Therefore we need fair inequality. Kind of obvious! But like you said wth is ""fair inequality""! it is for you to define what is acceptable. That is why we vote in our democracy"
