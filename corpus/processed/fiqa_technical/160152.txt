Most of them use TA or hopeful rumours to bet on. If you wanted to get into crypto from a solid fundamental base, it's probably too late. Most of the cryptocoins' returns (if any) don't match up to their valuation and pretty much all of them are in some form of beta. People are smelling the possible revolution that the underlying blockchain technology may bring to our current systems but are misplacing blockchain tech with the cryptocoins themselves. For correlation it's not very sophisticated but think of each cryptocoin as a company and you can draw lots of parallels. You can evaluate their returns (from their whitepaper), underlying technology, potential market share, their team, market sentiment, USP, comparison with other similar cryptocoins (also look at bubble markets in other technological revolutions), industry threats/potential. It's not impossible to make money, if the dotcom bubble is anything to go by there is clear precedent for survivors to thrive, it's more of a question of do you understand how everything works well enough to predict the survivors, if there even are going to be any?
