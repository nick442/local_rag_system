Insurance only works if there is a court system, and police, to enforce the insurance contract. So you're still dependent on a government. Even with our court system, insurance companies regularly defraud their customers and refuse to pay legitimate claims. I would not have any more trust in an insurance company than a government police force. Large institutions are rarely perfect and have many problems, regardless of whether they are private or government.
