"Taxation is only theft if you believe that you are the undisputed ""owner"" of the money the government collects as a tax. I argue that the concept of ownership only has meaning in the context of what property rights your fellow man is willing to respect. If, like me, you believe that taxes are a financial obligation that you must pay to participate in society, then the government has every right to collect those taxes from you. I'm sure you can imagine a set of rules by which the money actually belongs to you, but if you're the only one who wants to play by those rules, those rules don't matter a hell of a lot."
