"Like almost everything in economics, it's a tradeoff. Terms like ""good"" imply an absolute value. It *can* be good or bad depending on the circumstances, the exact amount it is being set to, and the importance of the things being traded off to different individuals, independent of their per-conceived personal opinion of minimum wage itself."
