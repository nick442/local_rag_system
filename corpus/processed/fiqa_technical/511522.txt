">The Port Authority operates New York City's airports, its seaports, a train system, and several bridges and tunnels. Newark Airport and Port Elizabeth/Newark are in NJ, not NY. And the ""train"" system, the PATH is half in NJ, as are all of the bridges and tunnels. Interesting why the article is so NY-centric."
