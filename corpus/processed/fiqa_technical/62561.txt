>Any business that can't generate enough cashflow to pay their employees a living wage is a shity business. Unemployment is down and minimum wage has gone up and yet there is still a record number of job openings. Again, this is irrelevant. For an employee to be paid a certain wage, he must provide value that is greater than that wage. This is because if the employee doesn't, he is a net *cost* to the employer. A shitty business or the current economic status regarding unemployment / job openings doesn't disprove this. Furthermore, the city of Seattle recently pursued a minimum wage increase to $15 which was studied by University of Washington. I encourage you to read the study. https://evans.uw.edu/sites/default/files/NBER%20Working%20Paper.pdf
