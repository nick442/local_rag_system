I've read some great posts on here and either small business or entrepreneur subs re bars and I've heard the complaints from friends of friends. Apparently theft/wastage is rampant so good cash and alcohol controls are crucial. Even if you don't have outright cash theft, letting bartenders get away with free or big pours for bigger tips ultimately gets you the same result. Your manager should know how many pours he's getting from kegs and bottles. If that adds up (it won't) then it could be a lack of business and you need some marketing. But apparently tracking your pours is the key. There are plenty of books and trade publications out there, so if you don't have a bar background, I'd suggest doing some reading or even talk to/hire someone to help you figure it out. It sounds like you have some systemic issues.
