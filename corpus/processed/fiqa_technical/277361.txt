Yes, the Fed has made a point of buying up longer-term bonds to push down rates on that part of the curve. That's not an indication that they're having problems selling Treasuries, in fact far from it. But apparently there's no demand for Treasuries and Bloomberg is just making up lies to help get Obama reelected? >Investors are plowing into Treasuries (USB2YBC) at a record pace as the supply of the worldâ€™s safest securities dwindles, ensuring yields will stay low regardless of whether the Federal Reserve undertakes more stimulus to fight unemployment. Buyers bid $3.19 for each dollar of the $538 billion in notes and bonds sold this year, the most since the government began releasing the data in 1992 and on pace to beat the high of $3.04 in 2011. The net amount of Treasuries available will decline by 30 percent once proceeds from maturing securities are reinvested, according to data from CRT Capital Group LLC. http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-04-09/record-treasury-demand-keeps-yields-low-as-supply-shrinks.html
