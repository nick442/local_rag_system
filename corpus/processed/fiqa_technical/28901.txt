Daqri is developing a smart helmet and is a name I keep hearing about when this subject comes up at conferences. Autodesk has been gobbling up tech like the Stingray engine for awhile with a heavy focus on real time modeling and simulation in the future. Some of the advancements they have made on that is quite impressive especially in the medical sector for stuff like air flow simulation for clean air rooms. That's not really a surprise though being that it's Autodesk. A year or two ago Google Tango was also a big buzz. The demo device I got to play with was pretty cool but the tech was still maturing and I think still ultimately waiting on better(cheaper) sensor tech. I expect sensor tech to start being standard on devices in the next couple of years. The big stand out to me is stakeholders (building owners) waking up to the way they can leverage this technology on the operations side and save money. Two of the last three capital projects I've been involved in asked for and utilized BIM, UAVs, LIDAR, Cobie and so forth. Compared to the previous biennium it's night and day. What's really missing are better ways to engage all this information in a Design-Build environment which is where I think AR will really shine.
