You can sell as many shares as you want. The only issue will be the fees attached to low dollar trades. I would recommend a site with no fee for the first 20 trades. If you plan to be a frequent trader I would recommend getting a stable rate ($10 for every transaction). If your plan is to trade in low quantities then maybe a variable rate (1% of all fades) might be better suited.
