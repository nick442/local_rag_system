Credit cards are meant to be used so generally it doesn't hurt your credit score to use them. To top it off you even get an interest grace period so you don't have to rush home and pay balances as soon as they're charged. In general you accrue charges during your statement period, we'll call it September 1 through September 30. The statement due date is something like 20 days after the close of the statement period, so we'll call it October 20. As long as you habitually pay your entire statement balance by the due date you will never pay interest. You charge your laptop on September 3, it shows up on your statement as $1,300, you pay $1,300 on October 18, you pay no interest. However, if you pay $1,000 on October 18 leaving a $300 balance to be carried in to the next statement period (a carried balance) you will pay interest. Generally interest is calculated based on your average daily balance during the statement period, which is now be the October 1 to October 31 period. You'll notice that you didn't pay anything until the October 18, that means the entire $1,300 will be included in your average daily balance up to the 18th of the month. Add to that, anything else you charge on the card now will be included in your average daily balance for interest charge calculation purposes. The moral of the story is, use your card, and pay your entire statement balance before the due date. Now how much will this impact your credit score? It's tough to say. Utilization is not a bad thing until it's a big number. I've read that 70% utilization and over is really the point at which lenders will raise an eyebrow and under 30% is considered excellent. If you have one card and $1,300 is a significant portion of your available limit, then yes you should probably pay it down quickly. Spend six or so months using the card and paying it, then call your bank and ask for a credit line increase.
