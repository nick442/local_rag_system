It would be hard to say everything is overvalued when value is relative between any two items or services. Most large corporate entities will hedge their positions, so even if a subset of securities or commodities moves negatively they preserve their value. Most of the people that promote these types of ideas are selling something that has an inverse correlation with the market, so they hope to get others to buy in and drive up prices for them so they can cash out. Or they are doomsday-conspiracy types.
