Accepting cash isn't free to the merchant's either. It needs to be counted, reconciled, stored, and taken to the bank each day. There is a certain amount that needs to be on-hand, not in the bank earning interest. There is more of a worry about employees taking cash from the register. There is the chance of inadvertently accepting counterfeit currency. I'm not sure how the cost of cash compares to the cost of accepting credit card, but there is a cost that cannot be ignored.
