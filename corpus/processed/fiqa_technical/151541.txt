I guess you could figure it out based on your total income, and the total number of hours it takes to generate that income if you want to do it simply. Count you job, side work, soda can deposits, and saving earned directly by effort (coupons and deal shopping) But the real answer to the question is understanding Opportunity Cost and what you could be doing instead. The problem with opportunity cost is the value system that judges the worth of the other opportunities is a deeply intrinsic factor that cannot be judged by anybody else.
