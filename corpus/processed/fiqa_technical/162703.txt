"The thing is, most people *don't care*. They think - for some reason - that Amazon is their ""friend"". I hear lots of stories about how ""Amazon's customer service is so awesome!"" Well, yeah, because they don't really care all that much about making a buck - and so far look how well it's worked out. Bezos is worth insane billions. They're not doing it to make profits, they're doing what they're doing because little Jeffey wants more $$ in his pocket."
