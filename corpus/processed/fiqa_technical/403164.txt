Prosper is the best solution that comes to mind when you need a loan fast. One of the best parts of Prosper is that you can choose the terms of your loan. Basically, you choose how much you need (from $2,000 to $25,000), the highest payments you're comfortable paying, and the term of your loan.. the interest rate is calculated based on what you choose. Investors bid on your loan listing (driving your interest rate down), and in as little as 24 hours up to a month, you'll have the funds wired to your account. http://www.prosper.com/loans/
