I compared it to NJ, NY and various other states through a database that escapes me now. It's an independent database that was partially funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation and I cannot find it now. I also went through the arbitration opinion between CPS and the union, as another datapoint. I'm sorry. I will try to find it and get back to you.
