There is a subprime loaning bubble in the auto loan sector which is growing; while it's not in the $1 trillion range or as hidden as the real estate one was, it could cause issues down the road if it continues. The use of derivatives or specifically, CDS, is continuing for other suspect investments. It was used about 4 years ago to help hide Greece's sovereign default and like in 2008, it allowed the bad debt to be hidden and thrive to dangerous levels. The use isn't widespread and limited to several firms so far, but its return as an instrument of choice so soon after the financial crisis is a little worrying that it may be a cyclical crisis.
