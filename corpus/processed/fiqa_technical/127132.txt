No, it isn't. The idea that you need a college degree for most professions is ludicrous. Despite having years of professional experience in a field, employers require costly degrees that possess little relevance to the skills required to perform the job. Specialized, scientific oriented, degrees are reasonable for very specific fields. But degrees should not be used as a bar to entry or advancement by employers as it is now.
