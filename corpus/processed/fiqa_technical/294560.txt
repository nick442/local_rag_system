One super-profligate man generates several orders of magnitude less economic activity than if 100,000 families had, say $100,000 each; less than he managed to spend. 100,000 families with that much more money would all be able to eat at restaurants, buy clothes (I don't care how big his, his wives, and his 18 kids closets are; we're talking something like a thousand orders of magnitude here) buy cars, and just generally create a thousand orders of extra economic activity here; their economic activity of buying would give further jobs to the sellers of all this stuff; which would in turn be able to buy stuff, and an economy recovers. *edit spelling, grammar
