"If all the property is going up and down at the same rate, it's probably a bit of a wash. However, there are markets (e.g. the Front Range of Colorado, where I live), where property at different price levels and locations has performed very differently. For a place to live, I think it's most useful to look at housing as a consumption decision, like buying a car, rather than an investment decision, like buying art (since it is similarly illiquid). Consider what you need and want (features, location), how important the ""own vs rent"" tradeoffs are to you (including the risk of losing your equity), and what you can comfortably afford. Then don't worry so much about price trends. This, it seems to me, is the lesson of the recent housing bust."
