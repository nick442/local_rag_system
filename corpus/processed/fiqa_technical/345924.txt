Tulip madness was likely a result of an expansion of money supply. Dutch govt initiated a subsidy program of gold minting before the bubble, attracting a lot of money into country and expanding the money supply(despite being on gold standard). See Doug French's free book on mises.org on this. Similar stuff happened in Spain when the american gold hauls were imported. And it matches the idea - banking system getting money first creates illusion of more credit being available than what savers are actually putting aside so the seeds for an unsustainable bubble are sewn.
