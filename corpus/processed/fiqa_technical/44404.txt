"I'm assuming you directed that question to me. I don't disagree with your question regarding a game. But potentially causing financial ruin is not a game. If everyone abused these laws our economy would come to a stand still due to a total crisis of confidence. Using Trump as an example: [The Baja Condo fiasco](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Ocean_Resort_Baja_Mexico). Trump gets paid $500k up front to license his name (nothing wrong with that) He also gets a percentage of future revenue (nothing wrong with that) He tells buyers he ""is involved at every capacity"". This is a lie. People feel confidant and put down deposits of $200k-$300k. [$22 MILLION in deposits are lost](http://articles.latimes.com/2012/oct/03/business/la-fi-trump-lawsuit-settlement-20121004) and the project fades away. All the investors/people get nothing. Trump made his $500k (possibly a LOT more)claims no responsibility and moves on. If everyone did this - our markets would freeze up."
