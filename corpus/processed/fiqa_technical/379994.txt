You say: Every time it seems the share price dips. Does it? Have you collected the data? It may just be that you are remembering the events that seem most painful at the time. To move the market with your trade you need to be dealing in a large amount of shares. Unless the stock is illiquid (e.g most VCT in the UK), I donâ€™t think you are dealing in that large a number; if you were then you would likely have access to a real time feed of the order book and could see what was going on.
