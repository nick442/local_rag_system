"Happy cake-day! The gap/disconnect in your argument is that the ""legal tender"", i.e., the money *itself*, is debt. Whether you use green pieces of paper, or yellow metal discs, or a credit-card authorization, you are not giving the seller a pair of shoes to wear, or putting braces on their kids, or fixing their roof for them. You are giving them an IOU, a marker, that they can redeem for that stuff. ""Legal tender"" just means debt that anyone will redeem. When you give someone a dollar, it is exactly the same as giving them a hand-written IOU that says ""bearer entitled to one pack of gum"" (or one cheeseburger, or one can of coke, or 1/40,000th of a Mercedes, or whatever). The only difference between your handwritten promise to make good on demand versus a printed dollar bill, is in the credibility of issuing authority, and the willingness of other people to accept it. > You can come into my store and I can insist that today I'll only accept euros. Or jelly beans. Or I can choose to simply not do business with you. We are two free people who are under no obligation to do business with each other, and if we choose to, how we choose to remunerate each other for that business is completely up to us. This is absolutely true. If I trade you a head of cabbage for a pair of shoelaces, there is no money involved, and no debt."
