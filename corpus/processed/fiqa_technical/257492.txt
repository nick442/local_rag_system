"I'd ask what your goal is. I was definitely on the path, and for one reason: to make piles of money. After some years in I decided to jump shit and get an MBA. Then the market went into freefall. Guys who paid their dues got fucked huge. Finance isn't the only way to get rich. It's one way, and it seems like the ""easy"" way. Do x-y-z and jump through the hoops and you are on the path. I'd suggest that if the money is really your true motivation, then there are other ways."
