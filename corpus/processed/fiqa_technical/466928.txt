GDP = total economic output (i.e. revenue), not income. But for investments, income is what matters. Add in productivity gains of around 2-3%/year due to technology and basic free market dynamics, and you will get closer to that 6% growth. Some mention mergers and acquisitions, but really that's just another form of productivity gains by gaining economy of scale and synergies. Now add in modest selective picking within the S&P index towards those companies which are doing the most in our current economy.
