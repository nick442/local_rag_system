I know this is old, but Joe Taxpayer is wrong. When you dissolve a corporation in selling it, all liabilities go with the old owners and the new owners, smartly starting with a new corporation and taxpayer ID, start with a clean slate. The only way this is not true is if the new owners did not change a thing legally and kept everything the same, other than there names, which would be entirely insane if you asked any lawyer in the country. Gift cards are a touchy situation, if not negotiated in the deal, by law the new owners DO NOT have to take them. Yes, it's good PR, but when there's a considerable amount of money out there it could bury the new owners by giving away free stuff.
