"You can certainly borrow from your parents, and they can take out a loan under their own names if you can persuade them to do so. That really is the best solution I can think of for a loan to a minor.. assuming that your parents think the trip is important enough to justify the cost and commitment of taking out a loan at all. (If they don't, they wouldn't co-sign for a loan either.) Other than that.. I think the simple answer is ""no"". You are probably going to have to find some other way to raise the money, or delay the trip. (Yes, theoretically there are things that can be done with them guaranteeing a loan on your behalf. But at your age, I don't know whether you would be considered legally competent to sign that agreement in most jurisdictions, and realistically it winds up being no less risky for your parents than the approach I suggested since they're still on the hook if you can't repay in time.)"
