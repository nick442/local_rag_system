">I agree the numbers are bunk, however the 900k figure is the ""opportunity cost"" of a moderate income family 60k-100k and not the actual. The problem with that.. is that *sans kids* most people really don't have much incentive to work all that hard. * You don't need anywhere NEAR as big of a house (heck, as a single or childless couple, you don't need a house, you can easily just rent a small studio or 1 BR apartment). * You don't need a minivan (or ""crossover"" or whatever the heck they call the equivalent of a station wagon these days). * You are feeding a LOT less people. * You don't need to worry about keeping anyone in shoes or clothes and buying new shit every year (provided you control your weight, of course, and don't ruin good clothing or follow ""fashion trends"" like a fool). * You don't have to plan & take expensive ""Disney"" vacations for anyone, much less a group of 4 or 5 (or more) people. * You don't have anyone to ""send to college"" or a teenager to ""buy a car for"" (much less pay insurance to cover). * You can pretty much ignore the vast majority of life-insurance costs (if you're single, do you really give a shit who gets anything if/when you croak?) * Likewise with health-insurance -- dirt cheap while you're young, and even cheap when your middle aged if you have no kids (and with good reason, no ""pregnancy/birth"" costs, no vaccinations or childhood diseases, no tonsil-removal operations, etc.) * Etc. Quite seriously, **people without kids simply don't have as many REASONS to work like ""slaves"".** A single person or childless couple can easily buy a home, car and other assets and pay it all off in a few short years (certainly less than a decade) -- **and live content & fairly well on a minimal income** after that. Remember things like **cars chiefly wear down because of ""mileage""**; and most mileage is spent either chasing after INCOME (commuting to/from a job from a home in the suburbs, said home bought ""to get the KIDS into a good school"" and ""to give the KIDS room to play"", etc) -- OR chasing round for the KIDS -- explicitly playing ""taxi driver"" carrying the kids around to/from school, team sports & other inane ""activities"". Ergo, the childless person (or couple) really doesn't HAVE to chase after the all-mighty dollar in the same way. *Instead they can enjoy life & leisure (and to paraphrase MasterCard, that can be ""priceless"").*"
