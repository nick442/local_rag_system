No - we're having fun seeing how long you avoid providing a single example of something you claimed was so universal any single one should suffice. It seems you totally pulled that statement out of your ass and now are so stubborn that admitting it must impact your psyche in some amazing way. So stubborn that you both don't address your claim, admit it is wrong, and yet you call us names for asking you to back up your statement. This is fun. You still have not listed an empire that did not purchase it's own debt. Your entire argument fails.
