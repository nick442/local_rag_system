">Yes sir, I'm working on compiling your ""precise evidence,"" and I'll have it printed and bound for you on the double. So you claim there is not competition, then when shown how many banks there are and asked for evidence, your reply is snarky assholism? And you believe ""there is no such thing as a relation between any interest rates and the cost to service the loans""? I'm becoming convinced you are either ignorant, a troll, or deliberately stupid. Either you have evidence for your claims or you don't. >rates are artificial Since the word artificial does not appear on the link you posted, what do you mean by artificial? How can you differentiate between ""artificial rates"" and ""non-artifical"" rates? What do you think the current rates should be?"
