">So people buying houses with inflated prices that they couldn't really afford isn't the problem? I don't know the guy's exact financial situation besides the fact that he is upside down and he has good credit but I'd wager that for this gentlemen it's not a matter of him ""not being able to afford the home"" but a matter of he can't get a lower interest rate from his bank. If he couldn't afford the home, he would have declared bankruptcy a long time ago when the bubble burst."
