"This kind of stupid myopia dates back to the 60s and beyond, when Star Trek was cancelled as a series for low ratings, but if you pick apart the demographics, it turned out it was a top show in the 20-40 demographic, which is a spending sweet spot. Today advertisers understand demos, but then they treat them like monolithic groups. The biggest example of this stupidity is when network channels schedule the same type show opposite its competition on another channel. For example, if ""Star Trek: Discovery"" and ""The Orville"" were both on broadcast TV, it wouldn't surprise me at all if they were in the same time slot, which is insane. SF TV, reality TV, sports TV - almost completely different audiences, and they're each going to be different markets for advertisers. ""Hey Bill - how come our snowshoe ads keep failing in Florida?"""
