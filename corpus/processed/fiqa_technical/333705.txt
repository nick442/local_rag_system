I'm all for Tesla succeeding but wtf is wrong with our country that it sponsors specific companies that are geared towards luxury automobile market? If its demographic is luxury owners, it shouldn't be govt sponsored nor subsidized. I realize this company has theoretically great potential for making breakthrough technology that *might* be then trickled down to lower consumption, however a prerequisite of receiving govt money of any form (loan or subsidization) should be specifically spelled out as geared for the greater good in mass. Not for their crony capitalism.
