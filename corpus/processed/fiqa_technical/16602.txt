Congress sets the budget, not the President. In 1981, the [97th Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/97th_United_States_Congress) had a Democratic House and a Republican Senate. In 1990, the [101st Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/101st_United_States_Congress) had a Democratic majority in both the House and the Senate. In 2001, the [107th Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/107th_United_States_Congress) had a Republican majority in the House, and a Democratic majority in the Senate, albeit for a period where the Republicans had tie-breaking ability in the Senate. Of these three, for only part of the 107th did the Republicans control Congress as a whole. There may be criticism of the GOP on spending, but it's not based on the graph shown.
