Exactly. I love Android and it's hard for me to feel bad about the company that ruins it the most, and the most consistently, having a rough time of it. I know it's probably not because consumers know what stock Android is, but I like to imagine that people are picking up the One X and getting turned off by all crap that HTC has broken in the name of being different.
