"Agreed. The idea that one goes into ""retirement"", or is expected to, at a certain age, is a little confusing to me. Since when did it become not-the-norm to work until you had enough money saved up, and then stop working. While I take full advantage of retirement tax vehicles, the idea of a dedicated retirement fund, retirement benefits, pension payouts, etc.. is a relic of the 1960s."
