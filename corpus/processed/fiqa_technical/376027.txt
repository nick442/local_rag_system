"Thanks for proving my point. I was comparing 2 impaired drivers and the first thing that comes up is a defensive ""Well, he could have smoked anytime in the past 6 weeks so he was probably just a bad driver!"" Now, I'm all for legalizing marijuana but not if people don't accept the fact that it is a drug and you should not be driving after smoking. Too many people refuse to accept that fact and it results in people dying."
