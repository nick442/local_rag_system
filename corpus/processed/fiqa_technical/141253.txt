It's not just about price. Uber and other rideshare companies provide several other things better than cabs: * However they do it, whether monitoring GPS or sensor data from the phone, rideshares incentivize drivers to accelerate and brake gently, as well as go the speed limit. Cab drivers, in my experience, drive like assholes. * By using the star rating system, rideshares incentivize drivers and riders to act like civilized people. Cab drivers, in my experience, don't give a shit. * By charging for time as well as mileage, rideshares incentivize drivers to take their time and get people where they want to be. Cab drivers, in my experience, want people out of the car as quickly as possible so they can get to their next fare. * Rideshares made it an effective part time job as well as a full time job. A driver can pick their own schedule and drive when they're available. One can make a living or just make some extra money. And my description of their business model is correct. Again, it's not just pricing. The medallion system ensures that a driver starts out in debt. It is a barrier to entry. It also ties a driver's retirement to a supply/demand market of a commodity. It's an artificial barrier that blocks supply/demand of people willing to fill the role in a market. All of this allows cab companies to charge whatever they bloody well please and pay their drivers shit wages, which is probably the reason they drive and act like assholes.
