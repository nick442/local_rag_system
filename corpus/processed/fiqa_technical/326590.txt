Dave Ramsey says you need to have at least $1000 in savings. The philosophy is that any typical emergency will cost you $1000 or less. Let me tell you - this has saved me more than once. Savings account is very liquid whereas you have no guarantees with the HELOC. Yes, debit is bad but you need to save and utilize the debt snowball method to pay down all your debt, including the HELOC. I would say the HELOC would be lower on the priority list than a credit card in terms of paying off.
