"In general what you will find is that a prepaid debit card will allow you to make any sort of purchase that is not also used as a ""Security"" against possibly open ended charges. A hotel wants to have a method of payment on file that they can potentially charge for damages to a room for example. The same goes for a car rental. Another limitation you will discover is when you are getting close to the amount of money that remains on the card. A restaurant will typically send through a preauthorization for the bill amount + 25%(for example) to account for a tip. If you have $60 left on your card and the bill is $50, the preauth may not be approved. Some prepaid debit cards, particularly those that are non-reloadable, start charging a service fee just for having the card after a certain period of time. This seems to be after a year, but YMMV. Lastly make sure that the card you get is reloadable. Some, like gift cards and rebate cards are sold to the buyer with a fixed amount on them and you cannot add additional money to them."
