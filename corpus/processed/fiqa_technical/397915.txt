"For finance, you need to have a strong handle on how to use Excel. I don't mean ""I can write some formulas and make a complicated worksheet"", I mean ""I know the VBA language and can utilize macros and specific coding to streamline processes and eliminate some tasks"". Having VBA on your resume is a definite plus, especially in addition to the CFA L1/L2 candidacy. [Here's a great resource for learning VBA](http://www.excel-vba-easy.com/). In addition to VBA, the ability to use R (the stats program) can also be incredibly helpful. That's a whole new beast than Excel, and has amazing capabilities that are almost perfect for finance. [Here's a resource](http://www.statmethods.net/) for learning the programming, but it requires a strong understanding of statistical methods and maybe another stats program like SPSS. If you Google ""learn R quickly"" or something like that, you can come up with something. It sounds like you're a Seattlite (Amazon, Boeing, Russell), and so am I. If you'd like help networking, feel free to PM me. I'm a recent college grad, and over the past few years, I've built a pretty solid network in the investments community here. I can at least connect you to people that might be able to help out. If nothing else, I can at least give a ton more resources to learn from. Edit: Also, Russell often uses LinkedIn to find new hires to interview. If you have a lot of groups and stuff in common with the HR team, you pop up higher in their searches. Look up their HR team, and find out what groups they're in, what companies they follow, etc. Also, do you know if you want to go into corp. finance or investments? Two very different games."
