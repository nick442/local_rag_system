Yes you are. Trickling down only works when there are enough jobs. All those receptionist that are being displaced by graduates or PA's will try to find a new job. But the economy isn't very good so career options are limited and the chance of improving your career are slim. So these receptionists apply to cleaning positions or McDonald. Cleaning companies might think hey here is someone who has proven to be reliable and being able to communicate with clients. They hire the receptionists. Where do the cleaners go? Not enough jobs = not enough jobs. When you have a comfortable middle class career switching might be an option but for the working class it is almost impossible in a bad economy.
