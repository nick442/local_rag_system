"Can anyone provide data regarding automobile sales, types of cars produced, and gains in employment as a result? I realize the post states ""The increase in auto production mirrors the growing strength of Americaâ€™s manufacturing sector, which has added more than 700,000 jobs since early 2010."", but I am specifically asking for automobile industry employment. Increased automobile production does not necessarily signify a stabilizing economy or a positive economy."
