Then you sir are one of the lucky few. I had a friend graduate with an English Literature degree and remain unemployed for 3 years because he didn't want to teach high school. He ended up back in college getting a Comp. Sci. degree. BTW, what do you do and I'm assuming you were employed already while in night school?
