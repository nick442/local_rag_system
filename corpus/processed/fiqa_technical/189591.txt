This was my thought, and it echoes something I've heard from former managers. You take the time to make a process or a segment of a process run very smoothly and efficiently, and then they hand that off to a junior manager and shift you to another process to do the same thing over again, because you're a good manager and you can handle it Rinse and repeat
