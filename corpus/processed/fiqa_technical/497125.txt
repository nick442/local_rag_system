I am sorry for your troubles. Presumably, you are feeling better which is the best possible outcome. You project that you are an honest person and desire to seek a fair outcome although you were mistreated. The insurance company should have paid a good portion of this bill. Because of this situation you will learn a valuable lesson. Namely that collectors are scum. They lie and manipulate to do their job. They are trying to generate an emotional reaction out of you so you give in an put this bill on a credit card. Do not fear them. My advice would be to ignore them. You can educate yourself on collections law in your state. They cannot call you at work and they probably cannot call you on a cell phone. They will threaten to garnish your wages, tax return, and take away your birthday. Just don't talk to them. When you can save up some money. Once you have like $1200 attempt to settle in full for that amount. Get it in writing ahead of time and do not give them access to your checking account. Use a cashiers check or prepaid visa (that you then throw away). If they say no, do not argue, hang up and call back when you have 1300. Rinse, wash, repeat. There is a decent chance that they have already violated some form of collections law. If you have proof you can call the company's legal department and provide that proof. You can then settle on having your collections waived. In summary: This also presumes you have a lowish household income. If you make like 70K, jut pay the bill. I doubt that is the case though.
