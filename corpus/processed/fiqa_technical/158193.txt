We're mostly talking about the same thing, but if they were trying to mold people for jobs they could be more successful at it, instead of requiring general ed classes and offering majors unconnected to any possible job.

Also, employers don't expect colleges to produce trained applicants, they expect other employers to do so, which is why they place such a premium on previous job experience.
