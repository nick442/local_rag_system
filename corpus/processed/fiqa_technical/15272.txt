"Buying shares back is an indication that the company has nothing better to do with their money. True. However, buying the shares back is essentially moving money around, the firms (or individuals) they buy from, will invest their money differently. Mergers and acquisitions are productive though. The idea is that you combine things to work more efficiently. For example, a small startup might have a great product but not a lot of infrastructure or cash. So the big guys with both buy em up. Or, big companies might have redundant expenditures in infrastructure or employees, and by merging they can produce more efficiently. The term you keep using ""real economy"" is a strange one. The above parties are part of the real economy. Really. What, may I ask, is your education in economics? What books have you read on the subject, classes taken, jobs worked, podcasts listened to, etcetera, that are giving you these ideas?"
