>I nowhere mentioned equal amount of assets. The point of my argument was wealth disparity. And, unless the rich pay more in taxes; that disparity will grow. Do you know what these words mean? The wealth disparity is literally the difference in amount of assets. In fact, you literally need a 100% marginal tax rate to prevent a divergence in disparity using your models.
