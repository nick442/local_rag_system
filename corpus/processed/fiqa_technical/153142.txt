There are quite a few details missing. What was your status in India when the property was purchased. How was the property funded? As your status now is PIO, assuming you have registered as PIO, and the purchase was funded from NRE account; You can credit the original purchase price into NRE account and repatriate. The capital appreciation has to be credited to NRO, tax paid and apply for repatriation. A certificate from qualified chartered accountant is required. Essentially it certifies you have paid tax and are compiling with FEMA (Foreign exchange management act) If you are not registered as PIO, you would need to apply to RBI (Reserve Bank of India, similar to fed) for permission to sell as this transaction falls under FEMA. You would in any case need a CA. A lawyer would also help. Assuming you were reporting this property in your US IRS returns .. You are liable for taxes in US. India and US have some amount of DTAA( dual tax avoidance agreement)
