"A financial engineering degree will help you get your foot in the door, and IEOR is a pretty good background to start with, but you should also just try applying to interesting-sounding things right now. If you get lucky, you'll have saved yourself a lot of time: work experience trumps financial engineering. I don't know quite how to say this politely, but there's a chance that if you do a full-time Fin Eng masters, you'll bump yourself out of the ""smart junior guy who we'll train"" category into the ""this guy is supposed to know something"" category. For my own group, the just-out-of-college people we've hired have been people who did internships with us before, which is no help at all. The interviews that I've done have been mostly looking for people with significant industry experience, and the FE degree won't help with that. It's a bit of a crapshoot. I'm not sure what to suggest, but I'll happily answer questions."
