"Let's not get too hung up on job titles. People hiring you are not interested in (or hoodwinked by)job titles. Call yourself The Grand Poohbah for all I care - what I want to see is what you were doing in that role, and how well you were doing it! Call your self ""Do It All Man"" or something silly. Believe me, looking at Resumes is the worst job in the world. When I was hiring people, I will give you my process. I open a gigantic envelope, take out a huge pile of paper. Try to find the application letter. OK - found it - great. Tear off everything except the first piece of paper, and chuck in the rubbish. If you sent an application letter which is less than one side of one page, your application automatically goes into the list of ""possibles"". Next, I find the CV, and I take the top sheet, and chuck everything else in the trash. If you can't convince me, using ONLY two pieces of paper, and ONLY one side of each: one applying for the job, and the other showing your relevant experience, THEN YOU NEVER EVEN GET AN INTERVIEW. If you want to spend 10 pages telling me about everything you've ever done - and you start at age 17 on page 1, then I will never get to know what you did after delivering milk at age 19, *because I threw the rest in the trash already*. OK, I got side-tracked. Sorry. Job titles mean diddly squat."
