Burgers don't sit pre-made at Wendy's (or any other fast food chain for that matter). The patties sit on the grill until a burger is ordered, and the sandwich is dressed at that point. Patties that sit too long are used for chili meat. In this instance, the patty may have been cooked too long and lost its flavor.
