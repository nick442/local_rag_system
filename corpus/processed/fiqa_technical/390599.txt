I received the same error message and was able to resolve the issue by checking line 7 of my 1040 form( where the total income from wages,tips,etc as stated on the W-2) and deleting the quantity I had placed in either of the gray boxes. If you wrote the sum of your income on the doted lines in either of the gray areas of line 7 (or other such areas on other lines) then this error might result. The grey areas as I understand it, are reserved for certain descriptors which are defined in the 1040 instructions included with the free file fillable form 1040.
