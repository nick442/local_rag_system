If you are investing, via whoever you want, wherever you want, and you're a US tax resident - you will be taxed. As with all the other questions, clearly your transfer of funds to your parents is not a real gift, and as such you will be keeping interest in the amounts. Income will be attributed to you, and taxes will also be charged to you. Having the money lie in your parents' accounts doesn't make the money or the income any less yours.
