I was too. My fiance is an international student and for a while we were really concerned about the implications of a Trump presidency on her getting a visa. I aired my grievances on T_D and was banned. What I've come to understand is that citizenship is a privilege, not a right. As part of the research I took part in while getting my Economics degree, we established mass immigration as a large, significant causal factor in the immergence of the income stagnation and the resulting rise of consumer debt levels and financial innovation that lead the the '09 crisis. The issue with T_D is the massive brigading and threats users and mods get. T_D would be a non-stop dumping ground of concern trolling and leftist hatred if the policies they have in place now were not in effect. That being said, I myself am proof that the policies and the mods that enforce them are much more forgiving than most subs on on this site. Try /r/askthe_donald
