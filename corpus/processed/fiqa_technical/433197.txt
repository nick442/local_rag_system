"Yes and no. There are different classes of shares - Some have voting rights, some *don't*. Some take precedence over others in a bankruptcy. Some get larger dividends. ""Common"" isn't really a useful description of your stake in the company. You *do* have a ""stake"" in the company, but not all shares are equal."
