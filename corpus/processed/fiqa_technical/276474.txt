Science & engineering degrees are better for employment, but still aren't a guarantee- no degree is. It's like degrees in general vs no degree- better, but not the golden ticket it once was. It's like being smart and hard working- they help with success, but they're not guarantees. It doesn't matter how many good decisions you make or how well educated you are or how hard you work if your luck (which is defined in this context as 'the totality of factors over which you, as an individual, have no control') is consistently shit. In the end, it comes down to luck. Education, preparation, hard work, and good decisions are all about shaping the odds. People who are doing well want to believe it's all hard work and good choices (because then they get the credit, and are safe- it's similar to the slut-shaming dynamic in this respect) and people who are not doing well want to believe it's all luck (because then it's not their fault).
