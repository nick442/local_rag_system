From what I'm guessing it would be pretty cheap since they already are build for a very similar industry with very similar competitive options or better options. With plants and organizations that probably have the same structure. Could also pivot into the new market with a known date to end. Maybe being even able to turn a small profit. Which is a lot better than going bankrupt
