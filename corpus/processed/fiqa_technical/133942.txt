I suspect that part of the problem with responding to surveys is that marketers realized they could use surveys as advertising. The last survey I actually responded to was over 5 years ago and was an ad for Geiko. I realized half way when they started asking me detailed questions about my memory of Geiko's commercials over and I then refused to give the satisfaction of saying Geiko.
