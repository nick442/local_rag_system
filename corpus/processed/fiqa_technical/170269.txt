Gotta love advice from a guy that bankrupted himself by spending like a moron. Also like how he didn't specify what taxes would be so crippling that he'd have to shut down the business other than the marginal tax rate which really has no impact on the business itself. I also liked how he asked his employees if they would continue to work for 50% pay, which is a failure at multiple levels. First, it fails to point out at a 50% rate isn't currently on the table. Second, if it was it would mean that worker was making a crap ton of money. Third, most of his employees probably can't stop working because they don't have a crap ton of money like he does.
