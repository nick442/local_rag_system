>The point is, the worker deserve a share of those profits. It is their work that has made them - in addition to the work of the CEO Uh, no. The main purpose of a corporation is to increase shareholders' wealth. Neither the workers, nor the CEO *deserve* anything from the profits, their pay has already been deducted as an expense. Profit is the residual income that is left to distribute to shareholders (you know, the guys who are risking everything. i.e. they are last to receive anything, if left, when a company goes bankrupt) as a dividend, or to reinvest in the company. If salaries are inadequately low, that is a whole different problem. Increase them, and have more adequate profit levels *next year*. But let's not get confused as to who deserves what. Personally, I find both Cat's remuneration's policy and the union's demands disgusting. So don't take this the wrong way. CEO is clearly overpaid already, but they did not just decide to give him a raise or something. Pay for performance measures are probably already in his contract. Maybe next time when that contract is renegotiated the remuneration board will propose more normal terms. The union on the other hand, with its unreasonable demands about seniority, and god knows what else, is likely to lead to many cut-backs (at the new terms), and unlikely, but possible, closure of the plant, leading to even more unemployment.
