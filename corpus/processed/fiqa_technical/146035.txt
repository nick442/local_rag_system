> Please read the other comments about That's all very well, and I **did** read the article - thank you very much for your suggestion; but my comment was not related to the other comments, it was a reply to a specific comment about smaller businesses being more responsive to customer complaints than smaller ones, something that I have not found to be true. In fact, it is often quite the opposite. Perhaps in your neck of the woods, small businesses are always polite and perfect, and never require your time. My opinion is different. For example, if a small business makes a mistake, then I definitely need to take time off work to try to fix it; possibly, I'll need to even personally go in. On the other hand, my large banks have people available nights and weekends, making it easier.
