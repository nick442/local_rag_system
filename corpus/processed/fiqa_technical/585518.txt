Hong Kong's day as financial center of China is over. China doesn't need Hong Kong anymore. Shanghai has reclaimed (rightfully?) her role as the financial center of China. The only path forward for Hong Kong is continual integration with other cities of [Pearl River Delta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_River_Delta). However, I don't have high hope for Hong Kong as its inexperienced political leaders don't want to reach political compromise with Beijing. Expect continual decline of what was once a great city.
