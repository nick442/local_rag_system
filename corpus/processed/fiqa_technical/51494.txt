Illinois' structural budget problems in the long term are due to Madigan and the Chicago Democrats. Illinois' current problem is because the Governor is a wealthy cruel idiot. Illinois is only one of 8 states with a flat income tax. It needs a progressive income tax in line with its neighboring states.
