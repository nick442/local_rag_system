As a consultant I charge my clients by the hour of my time they're occupying, not just my productivity. That means when I walk to the printer, task a colleague, scan an incoming email, go pee, time taken to tally productive tasks, or take an ergonomic stretch break are client paid non-value added work. Professions that track billable hours are not tracking productivity. Some more than others are definitely more productive in a given hour, but productivity will vary by the person and skill level.
