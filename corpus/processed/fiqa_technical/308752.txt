IKEA put lots of money and effort into their stores and the layout, making you walk a certain way and to buy as much as possible. Their stores are highly successful and if the website experience was easy, then users wouldn't go into the store. They actively make it harder to make web purchases than most other places. They charge a shitload for shipping, dont have all the availabilities and really make it a pain in the ass to order online.
