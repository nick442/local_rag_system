Also peak is going to get a lot worse. No-one is going to wait to plug their car in until bed time. They are going to plug it in as soon as they get home in the evenings, and if there are high wattage fast chargers to get that first 40ish % charged quickly before swapping to trickle charge then I have a feeling there will be peak price hikes as a result of the load increase.
