Yeah, we must be in completely different social circles. My friends all rave about the latest brunch spot with $15 all-you-can-drink mimosas or the Michelin star restaurant that you have to reserve months in advance (but they know that you can wait stand-by for three hours to get a table). The cheapest meals for me are $25 for lunch, not including alcohol. Dinners are easily $50+. That whole avocado toast article? Describes my friends to a T. Needless to say, none of us would be caught dead in an Applebee's. Even our burritos cost $8 (but hey, it won the 538 National Burrito Contest)
