Yep, I often think that baby boomers don't understand that there's inflation and that the salary they had years ago might not be good enough. Sure, median income has decreased in the last decade, but it's no excuse for paying engineers 45K because they'll jump ship as soon as they put their resume on Monster and get offer of 60-80k.
