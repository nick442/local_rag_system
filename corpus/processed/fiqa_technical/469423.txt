It's a great business. However, you should be aware that running your own business is a lot more work than it sounds like. Not only do you have to handle things like finances and taxes, but worse, you have to do all the marketing and sales, make deals, calm down difficult customers and suppliers, buying equipment & materials, supervising helpers & subcontractors, and more. If you're up for all that extra hard work, you can make great money building top-quality cabinetry.
