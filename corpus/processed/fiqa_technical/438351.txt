I think the big problem with unions is that their original reason for existence is obsolete. They existed to ensure safe working environments, fair pay and job security. In today's world, all of those things are law. At some point, unions became political machines whose goal it is to take membership dues and use that money to get their candidates elected. Once elected, these union-friendly politicians use their power to give unfair advantages to union members which ends up costing tax payers. Contracts are awarded unfairly, job sites are forced to higher x number of union employees and people are forced to join and pay dues, just to get a certain job. This is especially true in the public sector.
