I am confused as to what the author was talking about when speaking about the lack of features and research tools for stocks and how that is such a huge negative of Robinhood. If anything, I want a cheap, simple platform to efficiently trade. I might as well save a few bucks on commission, right? I can do my research online and through SEC filings, I don't need e-trade to tell me what stocks to buy, I decide. Whether I buy Cisco stock through TD Ameritrade's phone system for $45 per transaction or for free through Robinhood I'm still owning the same stock, the same company, at the same price probably within fractions of a penny per share. I get what the author is saying though about the general aurora of the app that is encouraging for people to invest who should not be investing. Maybe I don't see the problem with it because I like to think that I know what I am doing and don't just treat it like gambling.
