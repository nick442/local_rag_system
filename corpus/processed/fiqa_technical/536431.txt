Because those are supplementary jobs not careers. Those are jobs that high school kids and the retired can pick up part time. People that are working full time can teach themselves value adding skills like coding for free from a public library. Especially if they're only working 40 hours a week, they have plenty of extra time. I've worked 90 hour weeks for years and still taught myself useful skills in my free time. If these people aren't willing to improve their skill set while working a supplementary job then they will be left able to afford an ok life for 1 person. They should not have a family.
