I like how whether or not its okay to do *exactly* what the tax code says is determined by your presumed intent in following the tax code, and not whether or not you actually followed the tax code. Besides, what reasonable person or business *doesn't* minimize their tax burden, in the same way they minimize *every* and *any* burden?
