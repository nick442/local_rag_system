Hmm didn't expect downvotes for stating that QNX is technically one of the best. It is used in Nuclear power stations, the shuttle robot arm , in Ciscos top of the line carrier grade router (CRS1 using IOS XR), amongst many other applications especially within infotainment in the automotive sector. http://www.qnx.com/ It's a great asset that they bought at a good price. I have worked in embedded computing for 20 years in the corporate world, I have specified and used pretty much any OS you care to name, this is a great one with its transparent IPC, high availability manager, user mode drivers, etc. Please don't connect QNX with what you see on the blackberry phones because it's not the same OS.
