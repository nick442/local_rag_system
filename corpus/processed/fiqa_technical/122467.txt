Yea, people just don't get it. This is how much it costs to run and promote events. The reason Ticketmaster exists as a so-called monopoly is because local/regional promoters were getting killed by poor attendance on too many shows. So Ticketmaster came into existence because they were spreading the losses/profits of individual shows across the national spectrum. Additionally, bands started to ask for more and more money (in the form of upfront guarantees), and this has worsened since CD sales have collapsed and touring is their primary form of income.
