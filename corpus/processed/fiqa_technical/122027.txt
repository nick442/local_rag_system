"I laughed at this part: *""The executive of the U.S. banking giant cited travels to countries such as France, Argentina, Israel and Ireland. The U.S. has become ""one of the most bureaucratic, confusing, litigious societies on the planet"" and ""it's hurting the average American that we don't have these right policies,"" he said.""* Look - America is not ""the best country in the world."" But compared to France, Argentina, Israel and Ireland I can say that we're doing OK. France is the epitome of bureaucratic sclerosis. Argentina has been in economic crisis mode for years. As far as political dysfunction goes, Israel has its own problems with Zionist hardliners. And as for Ireland, it takes more than making yourself a nexus for IP royalty collection. A PO box is not a sustainable business model."
