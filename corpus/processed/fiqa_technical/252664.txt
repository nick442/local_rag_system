So are you saying neither the older generation or our generation (assuming you're under 35) are prepared for actually making decisions and being responsible? Because couldn't one argue that corporations evolve with the environment around them? The same reason we have things like banks sponsoring gay rights parades. Which, I'm not saying is a bad thing for anything. Just the fact that we've made it acceptable for CEOs to do this stuff in the same way that, all things equal, would never have happened in 1995.
