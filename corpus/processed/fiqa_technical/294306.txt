Stuff like this came about mainly when setting the new guidlines in medicare part D. Basically companies are able to reset their prices if they come up with a new method of delivery of a drug, sometimes it's faster and better but not always, especially since it's put into effect regardless. Since they already have a monopoly status due to the patent they set price equal to marginal revenue, which in this case happens to be quite a bit and since they own the only competing drug from what it sounds they are perfectly within their right to pull the old one.
