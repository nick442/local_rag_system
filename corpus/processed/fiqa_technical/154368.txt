"Bank of America exists at this moment because the US taxpayers gave it billions (Billions with a B) to save it in the 2008 crash. And they are part of the financial sector's successful lobbying against doing anything major to prevent another ""to big to fail"" situation, and are working hard to weaken the few protections put in place after 2008. Which means they are still too big to fail and the economy is still on the same rickety roller coaster it was a decade ago. Another crash is gonna happen, and BofA and the rest of them will have their hands out again. Put it in escrow for when the next bailout comes."
