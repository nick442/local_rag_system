>How do we know that's the reason? There's also more used cars in the wild now, and cars tend to last a lot longer than they used to. Average age of cars on the road also went from 3-5 years to 8-12 years now. People don't own cars longer because they last longer, they own cars longer because they are not as easily able to afford another. THAT is the main issue. GDP has gone up (although this statement is suspicious when you factor in inflation), but median income has actually gone down adjusted for the 1960s/1970s projected rates. People with more disposable income buy more cars, when there is more $$$ available to the average person they are not frugal and fix up their old car, they go out and buy a new one. So what we have seen are not only fewer cars being sold every years since 1969 but also that people are forced to own cars longer to save $$.
