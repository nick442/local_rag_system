Based on your comment that you were not owed the money, yes you do have to return it. The paperwork you agreed to when you setup the direct deposit, gives them the ability to reverse the transaction. I do not know the maximum time they have to pull it back, but they could do it without warning. If you spend the money and they pull it back, you will not be warned and you might overdraw the account. They might not notice for days or weeks, depending on how they do their audits. It is unusual for a large company to do this because their time card systems are designed to prevent this problem. If they are on US government contacts this would be bad for them. If they then billed the government for work that was not done, or they billed the wrong customer, they can face fines if the government finds out. You probably have some time before you have to tell them, but I would wait no more than a business day or two before contacting them. You might find out that they do owe you the money.
