I still laugh at the whole Skype thing. They have barely improved it since they bought it and in fact, the Windows 8 version should be pulled and they should put people on the desktop version. The functionality that existed in MSN Messenger that still does not exist in Skype should embarrass everyone. Want to appear offline to that pesky friend that messages you? Nope, you have to be offline for everyone or no one. Want to delete your account? Nope, that is literally not possible.
