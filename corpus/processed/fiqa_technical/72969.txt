My theory is that the massive swell of fear from 2008 until now has made people realize that they are never safe, and that debt is the killer. When private sector incomes drop (loss of job, less consumer demand, etc) we cannot afford to service our debt and this leads to catastrophic default, with assets being lost to creditors. On the other hand, if you own your assets outright, a significant and long lasting drop in income can usually be sustained, or at least the assets are not lost. In a time of high risk to income, like now, it is better to pay down debt, even if it means tightening the budget a bit. Better to lose some business/utility now than to lose it all later to creditors. Thanks for the post, there is some interesting info in here. I also find it interesting that these world class economists are presenting these horribly ugly excel graphs.
