>I don't condone corruption with peons or elites. I'm fairly anti-capitalist, though I'll freely admit it has benefits. The thing I really don't get though, is why so many self proclaimed capitalists seem to support crony capitalism ot at least turn a blind eye to it. Aren't most conservatives heavily against corruption in politics?
