"Every one of those articles correctly point out that $3.7 trillion is **the size of a bond market**. Not one calls them a **""business worth $3.7 trillion.""** The size of a market is not not the value of a business. I guess even after all this you're still unable to grasp that. His quote: ""The banks achieved this gigantic rip-off by secretly colluding to rig the public bids on municipal bonds, **a business worth $3.7 trillion**"". Are you really too dumb to understand the difference between ""a business worth $3.7 trillion"" and the value of an entire market? The derivatives market is ""worth"" on the order of hundreds of trillions. Which businesses exactly are worth that much? This is the type of ignorance that Taibbi articles relies upon to make them work. I'm done here since you see two numbers that are the same and conclude they mean the same thing."
