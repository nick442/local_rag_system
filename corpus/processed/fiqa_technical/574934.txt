Come om guys, it'll probably e either 50.000 as a maximum for number of applicants, or 50.000 jobs that you can apply for but don't necessarily need filling right away / at all. For example they are already filled but just thrown out there in case a special candidate applies. Or all shifts in the warehouse are counted separately, like the extra ten people in the morning are counted as separate jobs etc etc endless possibilities.
