I agree of course that we SHOULD just test a product to see if it’s good or not. But as the article states, a lot of consumers discard it based off date alone. So if a company can make X amount of dollars more by saying their eggs expire a few days earlier, that can be abused, right? All I’m saying is there’s so much ambiguity on the dates on packaging, some more regulation would be helpful (like regulations on ingredients)
