>OK, great, where do I apply for my refund? An odd question, but I'll answer it if you really don't know. Tax credits will only likely be a refund if you pay too much tax during the year, otherwise they will be reductions in your yearly tax bill. In most countries, tax credits are awarded when paying taxes. Assuming you are from the United States, that would likely be in April on your individual income tax form. Tax credits can be earned for doing anything the government deems desirable or worthy of exception. Examples include buying a first house, having children, starting or running a business, paying tuition, adopting a child, caring for an elderly or disabled person, earning money overseas, paying certain types of medical insurance, and being married in addition to purchasing a zero emission or low emission vehicle.
