If you are not open to changing the amount of money you are willing to spend, your options are limited. Why change your amounts and proportions? Your situation changed. You got married, divorced, purchased a new car, the company added free disability coverage. If the amount spent per year can't change, then you are asking how to review if your proportions are correct. The first thing is to look at what must you spend it on. If you have a mortgage or car loan, the bank will tell you the minimum amount. If you own a car the state will tell you the minimum amount for auto coverage. If there is any money left look at life, and disability. These can wreck the life of your dependents. When you have meet those needs, then increase auto and home to cover additional liability.
