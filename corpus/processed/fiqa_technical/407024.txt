The typical pension is worth about 8-10% of income. My source is that when my company eliminated the traditional pension and flipped to a cash value account, the deposit to the cash value was 8% of gross income each year. Obviously, the terms of each plan will vary, this is a swag more than a valid fact that applies to all.
