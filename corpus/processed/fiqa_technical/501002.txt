Lowe's is closer to me, but Menard's tends to have better prices or frequent sales that draw me in. We have Lowe's, HD and Menard's all within 5 minutes of my house, with the Menard's and HD being less than a mile apart. Menard's seems to be about twice the size of the other two stores, plus their lumber yard and in-stock materials is unmatched. The only complaint I've really seen about Menard's is that they don't offer a military discount like Lowe's and HD do.
