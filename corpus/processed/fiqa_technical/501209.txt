This article is very one-sided and absolutist. It also pulls the struggles from one industry and uses that as a basis to declare resumes are a useless part of the hiring process in general. What works for a Tech start up doesn't work for someone hiring a nurse or an accountant or a salesperson. Most egregious is that this article completely ignores the point of a resume. Of course anyone using a resume to make a hiring decision will see poor results. A resume is there to be able to pare down your candidate pool to see who you are interested to bring in for interviews and eventually assessments to learn more about them. It is also pretty easy to verify employment history with a single call or services like The Work Number. You can provide assessments and ask interview questions to see if someone really knows the information they claim to know on a resume. In order to remove the resume from the hiring process, you have to solve the issue of being able to easily and effectively narrow down a pool of applicants while having a tangible summary of education, experience, skills, etc. Online methods of eliminating applications by keywords have shown to exclude highly qualified candidates. Until such a method is discovered, the resume is still by far the best took to summarize a candidate, and to decide who you want to learn more about.
