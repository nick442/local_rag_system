Seriously. Nobody wants another exclusive platform at this point. So all it can be is another open platform to play games on. Something like one of those Razor Nvidia thingamagigs. An android console was already tried multiple times and failed, nothing revolutionary. Just another cash grab at the Atari name. Microsoft barely broke into the console market after dumping billions into the console. No one is going to dump billions into Atari at this point. Even Facebook after buying occulus is very careful with it right now.
