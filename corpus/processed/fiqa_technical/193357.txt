It is not a limitation of ebooks. Limitations are imposed by Amazon (and others). The large publishers likely tell Amazon they won't let Amazon sell their e-content without draconian policies. However, I beleive Amazon includes draconian policies even on ebooks without such customer hostile publisher demands so that makes it difficult for Amazon to claim they are not choosing the draconian policies. I sell my ebook through leanpub http://leanpub.com/managementmatters You buy it, you own it. Leanpub doesn't go around deleting it from your device. The draconian policies are choices by publishers and retailers, not some condition of ebooks, in the way the articles states.
