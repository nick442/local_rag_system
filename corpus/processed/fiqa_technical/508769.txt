"I think you want to look at companies that buy annuities and give you a lump sum. They exist to do this for lawsuit payments, lottery winnings, etc. I'm not sure what the fees would be on a relatively small payout of $6K but try searching for ""converting annuity to cash"" and the first several hits were all firms looking to buy structured payment settlements for a lump sum. They make their money by paying less than the present-day value of the annuity, so you will get less money this way than collecting your payments slowly."
