Since most developed countries view a low but positive inflation rate as ideal, it is very likely that we will end up with positive inflation. However, modern societies such as Japan have experienced extraordinarily long periods of deflation. In their case, however, it is mostly due to a political unwillingness to impose the costs on savers, as savers are politically in control. As to your point about things being so much cheaper in our grandparents' days, this is actually completely untrue for the vast majority of goods when measured in real terms (e.g., relative to the median workers' wages). Today a decent bicycle can be bought with the average worker's earnings over a few days, whereas our grandparents would have had to work over a month. A modern radio can be bought for perhaps an hours' worth of work ($10 on amazon.com), but our grandparents may have had to spend months working to buy their first radio. There is no reason for this trend not to continue. Point is, inflation is not such a bad thing so long as wage growth keeps up or exceeds it.
