> A CFA is getting common but it might help - it probably won't hurt at least. MS and MBA's are dime a dozen compared to CFA's. If you want to move into trading/research/port mgmt, a CFA is as desired (and allows better networking opportunities via CFA societies) than a MS. Other than that, I will second the majority of what you said.
