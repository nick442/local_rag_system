Are you out of your mind? Federal spending has doubled since *2000*. WWII might be the only time our government was ever bigger (and incidentally, slashing that by 75% directly preceded one of the greatest growth periods in our history). Seriously, can you name me three programs or departments that have smaller budgets, in real dollars, in 2012 than they did in 2008?
