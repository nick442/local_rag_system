Whenever I've tried to actually buy something at an Apple Store I've found it a frustrating experience. With no line-ups or registers the process of actually buying something becomes a mess of finding an employee not helping someone else and hoping no-one else is quicker than you. I've tried using the ipads to request help but it seems they prioritize the people grabbing at them rather than the queue. Because of this I only go to apple stores to browse.
