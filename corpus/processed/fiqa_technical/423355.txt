That seems unrealistic given his history of supporting corruption and ethics breaches. He was warned about corruption, ethical, and loyalty concerns for a bunch of his cabinet and he brought them on anyway. These people did not get outed by trump, they abandoned him because he is a petulent, poorly performing, and all around unstable executive. He cant even respond to domestic terrorism in any acceptable way.
