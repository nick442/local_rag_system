> Queue the increased prices at the grocery store Nope, we will eat the rise in cost. Grocery stores are in an all war of attrition and the ones who don't keep prices low are going to lose all their customers. Really the only thing going up in cost lately that saw a retail raise was Asparagus, but that was due to rain.
