KI understand that. So make them not poor. We are in a post masse population control era. Elites can dilute the means of information but net results of a massive informed populous is pushback. The 1900s showed that incremental changes in living standards along with tehnological introduction keeps the populous fat/happy which is all anyone wants. This stopped in the mid 70s, standards of living relied almost exclusively on tech innovation to increase. Financially, anyone not in control is the same as they were since then, adjusted for inflation. Its almost laughable how easily the American, or ANY consumer market for that matter wants to be satisfied. Any company fighting tooth and nail to try to stall the eventual money an employee would spend with ian increased wage is alienating customers. Plain and simple. The rich dont by More, they by more expensive. Sure per unit they add more to the economy, but there input is spread over specialized and specified craftsmen, not large market producers. Less jobs, less infrastructure and logsticis, less revenue entering the system. Opening dollar store customers to biglots and winco, for example, would open the possibility of so many more purhases of larger brand, and large employeeing, products. Fatten your cows, you lazy capitalists, otherwise the milk will get thinner with each year.
