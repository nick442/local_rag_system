"Yes, since all those things ""uncovered"" by the last audit were already covered in previous audits. You don't think that perhaps some politicians are trying to get politicial credit by chasing a ghost? Read what Sanders wrote on his website. Then read the actual audit. Then tell me if you think he is perhaps grandstanding. A prime example is his claim that 16 trillion was lent, which is pretty dishonest. At no point was there more than about 2T lent out (from the audit itself) and at no point was the US taxpayer on the hook for over around 2T. The quote you provide is an example of this misleading rhetoric. Go and read the actual report your news stories refer to."
