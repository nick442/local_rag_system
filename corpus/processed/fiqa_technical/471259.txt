"Hahaha, that sounds good but in real life pensions are almost never fully funded and almost never fully funded when starting off. That is why the post office is almost always losing money. They're required by law to pre-pay some crazy number like 70% of pension and retiree obligations up front which sucks up all resources. When a employee opens a pension plan their employer starts contributing a target amount dependent on the stated benefits and the actuarial projections. The market doesn't always go up and the actuaries are not always correct with lifespans either. You take the risk of losing that pension if you work for a bad company, same as if you invest in an employee stock option plan. You can usually take a lump-sum payout, but who would do that when you can get ""guaranteed"" money."
