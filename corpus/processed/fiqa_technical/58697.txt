"lol! You've seen this army, have you? I have. The *Bureau* of Labor Statistics is in the DOL building, right off of the Mall. It's a square city block, four stories tall, mostly full of bureaucrats who professionally avoid making decisions. The Bureau of Labor Statistics is an office on the second floor with about twenty overworked people in it, who compile and massage reports that they require industry groups to submit at regular intervals. Twenty people is hardly an army, and they do *absolutely zero* legwork of their own. ""Correct for it"" my ass. The more you learn about how the sausage is made, the less interested you are in buying any of it."
