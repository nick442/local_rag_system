Enron did a wide range of dodgy financial accounting, using tricks to severely mis-represent their financial situation. They then used these doctored accounts to fool lenders and stock-buyers that the company had more money, and fewer debts or problems, than it really had. Eventually they ran out of money and went bankrupt, leaving the lenders and stock-buyers with nothing.
