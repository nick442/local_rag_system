The article clearly states the tax dodging isn't more than an ancillary benefit. Who knows. I do know Big Tobacco split their co's in half between domestic (US) and international operations due to the incredibly burdensome regulatory environment. It was holding back growth plans. There may be some of that here. Or maybe BK doesn't want to file for bankruptcy for the umpteenth time this decade. This is a way to spread the debt around and stabilize.
