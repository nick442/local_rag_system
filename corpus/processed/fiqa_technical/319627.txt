Hmm, I see so the difference between a capital account flow and a current account flow is whether the capital belongs to a citizen of the country or not. You mentioned that moving to a country i.e. immigration is also another remittance flow. So if a country suddenly received a large number of rich immigrants, it would show up as an increase in the current account?
