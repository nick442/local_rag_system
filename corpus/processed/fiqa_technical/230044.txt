The Playboy bunny is firmly in the pantheon of commercial icons alongside Apple's apple, Coke's red & white swoosh, Disney's mouse ears and the Golden Arches. If you had to tell the story of the 20th Century strictly in graphic images, he'd be smack in the center of it all. Whatever your politics you have to give him that. RIP Hef.
