I stopped reading after decline in real US dollars, have you see n the recent data? Secondly the DOW is NOT A PRICE!!, it is a level (thats what an index is!) Check the fundamentals, track the price changes of normal things you buy and that is inflation, using market indices as a proxy for inflation is stupid and sample dependent (you can sample before and after merkel says eurobonds and get different results..)
