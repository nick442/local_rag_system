A ton of good comments and a lot of innocent comments. Basically with fractional reserve banking, the creation of money out of nothng to increase the money supply is very simple to do and happens every second. But like anything leveraged, it's great in good times adn horrible is bad times. Contraction is magnified so if I pull out $1, the banks available funds are decreased by a multiple of that (depending on the reserve requirements and capital requirements). SO to answer you're question, the money gets destroyed and disappears and a portion remains.
