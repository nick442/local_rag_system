the way I see it, capitalism only works when you have people with good civic values involved. people like carnegie, warren buffet, etc. who not only accumulate wealth but then direct it for the benefit of society as a whole as well as for their own benefit. i believe that many capitalists use their wealth to create dynasties - this leads to aristocracy which is undemocratic, and also spoiled rotten trust fund babies, which are the worst people in the world. capitalism without values is horrible, just like any other system. i'm a business man, but I'm not interested in getting ahead by screwing other people and I certainly give back to my community in my own small way. it's good for business too - people like to patronize businesses that give back.
