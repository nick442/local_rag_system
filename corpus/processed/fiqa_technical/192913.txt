Sorry, but whether or not you drive in New York, the New York State Department of Motor Vehicles requires you to get a license in New York and surrender your California license. According to their website: If you become a resident of NYS, you must get a NYS driver license within 30 days and surrender your out-of-state driver license. Normally, you cannot have a NYS driver license and a driver license from another state, but there are exceptions. It is a violation of Federal law to hold more than one commercial driver license (CDL).
