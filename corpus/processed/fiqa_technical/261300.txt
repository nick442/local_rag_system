First, I must say I am a Ramsey fan. Here's the thing, the borrower is slave to the lender, so if you eat Thanksgiving dinner with your generous relative next week, the food will taste different. Before I was a Dave fan, I borrowed money from my cousin once, and that debt was always hanging over my head. At times, it made hanging out awkward since I had money to 'go out' but not money to 'pay back.' It felt great once I paid him off, but the awkwardness was never cool. I'm sure some will disagree (Dave wouldn't), but if you TEMPORARILY stop your 8% contribution, and combine that with your current margin, you could pay off the debt from your cash flow and complete your emergency fund. Since you said that $11k is 1.5 month's expenses, you would essentially need to double that for a three-month fund or quadruple it for a six month fund. I know $300 may not seem like a lot, but since I value family over money, I would pay that off today out of the $11k and then replenish and fill the emergency fund. Also, your expenses will have dropped by $300/mo., so it will take less money to get to three or six month's expenses. Once that's complete, get your full 8% contribution. FYI: I consider margin to be the difference between your income and your outgo.
