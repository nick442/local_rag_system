I'm a big fan of indie movie theaters. But I'm going to have to advise you to come up with another idea if you want a for profit business. Many independent theaters are non-profits, others are vanity investments by wealthy owners who don't mind losing money. The rest just go under. Also, if you don't have any industry knowledge you will never make it to opening night.
