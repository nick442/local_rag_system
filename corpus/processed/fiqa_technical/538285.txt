"At some point isn't it counter-productive to slap warnings on so many products that have an unproven correlation with increased cancer risk? Where do you stop? Grilling food increases carcinogenic compounds in food. Does California need warning labels on grills? Once there are enough warning labels they'll just get ignored, defeating the original purpose. Has your mattress warning label really made you more cautious about potential fire hazards? While I don't know if RoundUp really increases cancer risk (I'm inclined to doubt it given the last couple decades of 'human trials"" and no clear science based evidence that I'm aware of) I do know that crying wolf is the best way to condition people to ignore serious warnings about real risks."
