Setback for businesses? Please. It's clear someone has bought into the DNC and GOP's crony capitalist lies. This bill is staunchly pro consumer. In fact, it's pro honest business. It's only a setback for businesses who actively screw their consumers. I'm a libertarian, but even I can recognize this regulation as an all around win for society.
