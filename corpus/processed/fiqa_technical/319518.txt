I'm wondering about the statistic. I'm technically an affiliate for one of these MLM companies but chose specifically not to work the business. I signed up because I like the products and as an affiliate I get a steeper discount than I did as a customer. I know several people who do this. Are they counting us as part of the 99%? Is it really losing money if we're not actively part of the business?
