"\*Yawn\* This was talked about a LOT back in the Y2K era.. so maybe people to young to remember that will not have ""heard about it"", but everyone else should have. And the ""catastrophic"" implications of it (just like the whole Y2K thing) have been ridiculously overblown and exaggerated. As is the ""level of risk"" for the ""coming decade"". We really don't know anywhere near enough about these kinds of events to make even the most crude of probabilistic predictions regarding their frequency or intensity, much less what the effects would be on modern systems. IOW, this is just rather pointless and sensationalistic ""scare mongering"" -- must have been a slow news day (or maybe PBS wants to ""distract"" people from other news)."
