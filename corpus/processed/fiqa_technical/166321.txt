I know a software engineer that hated his Dilbertesque job (with no personal interaction he said), quit to go work at G.I. Joes and worked his way up to manager. He was the head manager of a G.I. Joes store. I worked at sports authority one Summer and there was a guy with a law degree working there. If you apply to 50 retail jobs, there is a good chance that one will hire you and you will no longer be unemployed. I'm not quite sure whether that is a hinderence or a help though in finding work in your specialty in the future.
