I don't see kids that are just post-college as feeling like they're entitled at all. If anything, I see just the opposite. Everyone I see that's around 21-25 has some other shit going on besides their normal work. I had a neighbor that sewed/sold bike accessories, I see guys fixing up old mopeds and they have office jobs. A gal at the coffeeshop recycles some cast-off materials and makes designer wallets. I see some really enterprising stuff from this generation. I see these same people busting their asses for a corporation that doesn't pay them well because they don't have to (why waste a good recession?). I just don't see it in my personal life. It's easy to turn on MTV and make generalizations about idiots in high school (and we were all idiots in high school). I find it appalling that there are so many of these bullshit stories about how there's just this big problem of nobody with the skills to do the work that's demanded. These companies that would just love to hire more people - if there was only someone out there with the skills they need. It's complete bullshit. If they can't find anyone, it's because they're not offering the right economic incentive.. there are millions of unemployed folks out there right now that can be trained.
