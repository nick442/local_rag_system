"They are a screwed up company. They constantly mess up our billing. It takes me calling every other month to fix it. Their auto billing is also messed up. Their tech support is also screwed up. The amount of times I have spent an hour on the phone with them to find out ""there is an outage in your area"" is pretty funny. I even lead off with that question and it never is until the 1 hour mark."
