Energy futures are the most direct form of investment. Look at Nordpool for example. Energy markets are typically fairly efficient and seasonal pricing patterns are already baked into the forward curve. On the outage side, there's data providers who track major unit outages and disseminate that information. If you think you're smarter than groups with on-staff meteorologists, huge data advantages, and a real understanding of grid topology in those markets than by all means play a position. It's certainly possible to flip the coin and win but you have no edge doing so; you're just gambling.
