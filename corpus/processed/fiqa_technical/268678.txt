"Money relationships are the opposite of friend relationships. That's why there's so much danger in loaning money to a friend - if the transaction doesn't work out well for one of you, it can destroy the friendship. Many of the answers here suggest you be prepared for the possibility that your friend will not pay you back. This is called a ""gift"". Give your friend the money, and trust that they will feel grateful. That gratitude will create generosity, and they will in turn seek to give gifts to you and to others in your circle. If you're not ready to give money to your friend, then you're better off not doing it. If you are ready to give money to your friend, then do it without expectation of return."
