Bingo. Measuring income is an ignorant approach. Buying power is the only thing that is important. If the $14/hr minimum wage nonsense ever actually happened, all the reports would be on how awesome it is that some small percentage of people are making more money. What won't be reported right away is how all people (include those minimum wage workers) have significantly less buying power thanks to the significant inflation created by $14 minimum wage.
