I don't think they could have done anything besides what they did. There's plenty of cheaper alternatives that no one talks about because they're not as good. Lego has been the world leader for decades because of its commitment to perfection. I'm guessing their boom had a lot to do with their diversification. They went pretty strong into TV shows, movies, video games..all of which are getting old.
