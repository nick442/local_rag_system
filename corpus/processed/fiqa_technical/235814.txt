true but the GOP supports this network and framework of US law that actually encourages businesses to do this. Dems like Obama want to do a minimum tax for multinationals to make american employees more attractive and to end some of the tax hiding these corps which depend on the american military and good name to make a profit. The GOP are against this. we shouldnt give corporate america a free reign and then ask the american worker to compete with workers in other countries that dont give a fuck about the enviroment. They dont care if they kill every fish in the rivers. To compete with workers that live in countries with zero labor laws. The answer is NOT TO FUCK OUT ENVIROMENT. THE ANSWER IS NOT FOR AMERICANS TO TAKE PAY CUTS. THE ANSWER IS NOT OUTSOURCING. THE ANSWER IS NOT TO DO AWAY WITH OUR CLEAN AIR AND CLEAN WATER LAWS. the answer is to make it less profitable for corps that enjoy all the benefits of being american, for them to send jobs overseas, The easiest way to do this is with tax code. You cant just have your base in america. use our army, our intelligence services, and our strong arming, and courts, but then only employ people in china.
