"IIRC there was a bit of a controversy with Google promoting its own services a year or two ago. I failed to see fault on Google's part, but if you searched for something like a zip code, it would say: ""Looking for zip code? Try Google Maps"" (with link of course) Then search results followed. Google agreed to stop, but I don't think it was clear they were violating any laws."
