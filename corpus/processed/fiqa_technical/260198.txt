I think the biggest issue here is why are employees still dependent on their jobs to order to receive health care? Why should businesses be responsible for providing this? What needs to happen in order for us to free businesses from this burdensome requirement? Single payer? Insurance sales across state lines? The number one problem here is cost of medical plans, how can that be lowered?
