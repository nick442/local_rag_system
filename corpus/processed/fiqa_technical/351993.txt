Businessweek is a magazine. The Atlantic is a magazine. They publish articles, while Vice is an investigative news outlet. So, you're comparing apples to oranges, even if you don't understand that they're not equivalent organizations. You don't even seem understand how Vice's business works. They're not focused on ad revenue through clickbait. They're focused on content creation for lucrative media deals, which has accelerated Vice's value far faster than the other outlets you mentioned. Everything you are saying is light on analytical reason, but very heavy on definitive provocative statements. Essentially, you are replying with very low quality posting. So, I'm probably going to stop engaging you; because whether you're a troll or just heavily breathing from the mouth, I suspect that further attempts at reasonable dialogue with you is a waste of my time. Toodles.
