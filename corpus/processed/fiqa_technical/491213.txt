I order what I can from Amazon if the price is same to HD/Lowes. Too easy to just order at night when I am done working and it shows up a couple of days later..saves me a lot of time. Amazon has terrible prices/selection of electrical, pipe and drain fittings. It is also hard to buy lumber or concrete on Amazon; I would if I could.
