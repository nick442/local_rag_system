Best Buy has always had high prices and horrible customer service. Can you tell I have a chip on my shoulder? lol they installed a stereo in my truck and broke the ac which cost me over $1900 to fix. After weeks of having a lawyer hound them, they sent me $1000 to settle the claim. Wasn't worth my time to miss work for small claims court. P.S. why is $1900 and the common man considered small claims? Big companies like Best Buy and Paypal just bully people using the law, and I'm sick of it!
