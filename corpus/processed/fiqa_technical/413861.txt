I remember the last time I was in a Sears. It was 3 years ago near La Jolla. I needed a bungee cord, and figured it was a good bet that Sears of all places would have one. I looked for 10 minutes, couldn't find one, couldn't find an employee to help, finally just asked a cashier who told me the sporting goods store next door had them. And that was the last time I went to Sears.
