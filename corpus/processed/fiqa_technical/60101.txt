I couldn't believe they blew money on a fucking share buy back. Even the product issues aside, how moronic is that? Hey guys, we are 3 years behind the competition in technology, our next product is another 2 generations from now, and sales are collapsing around us. Should we maybe INVEST IN SOME FUCKING R&D!? Nah, lets hand out the cash to shareholders. I'm sure they would prefer a 5% share price boost now instead of long term survival of the company.
