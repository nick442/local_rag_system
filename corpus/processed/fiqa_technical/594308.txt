"People who choose ""good enough"" (satisficers) tend to be happier than people who choose ""the best"" (maximizers), see link. So decide you want to be a satisficer for most decisions, and then work at it: deliberately limit the amount of time you spend on a small decision, and celebrate a non-optimal decision. Decide to be good to yourself, and say it out loud. Practice the skill."
