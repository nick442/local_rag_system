It's literally been a Fox News talking point since the march that 4chan started. You can pretend you aren't just parroting their talking points but pointing to some Wikipedia article in your head is beyond stupid. I ignore people who clearly are uneducated and have no idea what they're talking about. Like you. Right now.
