"I'm surprised there's so little sympathy for the model here. Her image was used in a sexual context without her awareness or consent. What BK did was probably legal but definitely immoral. If a male model sold the rights to a picture of his face would it be OK to make billboards saying ""This is the face of an abuser""? As for the reaction to her using the word ""rape"", yes it was probably unnecessary and insensitive on her part. However, she quite reasonably feels violated in a sexual way and was drawing attention to that. I don't think that a poor word choice should distract us from the fact that she has a very reasonable gripe with how her picture was used."
