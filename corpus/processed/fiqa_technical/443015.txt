">Family business can also decide to go for short term maximum profit at the expense of long term. And shareholders can decide to look long term See my parenthetical above: ""(though many still choose profit). Public companies..are much less likely to avoid the pressures"" You are quite correct that both public and private companies can have long-term vision, short term vision, or a mixture of both at the same time. But the corporate structures of each change the internal pressures in a way which, in my experience, do not lead to an equal split between which types of companies trend in one direction or the other. >just go to shareholder meetings and you will see everything. I do, and you are correct. I've also seen an increasing trend in short-term thinking over the past decade and a half at those meetings. The next quarter's profits and market share drive them much more clearly than they used to, particularly in anything tech and finance related. >In general, anti-monopolly laws only help create olligopollies This is a concern; though oligopolies existed before anti=monopoly laws. There are cases when attempts to break up monopolies result in a small group of colluding factions, and this needs to be watched. >..only help create olligopollies/monopollies.. In what manner have anti-trust laws created monopolies? (I don't doubt the possibility, but an example would be helpful to visualize your critique.)"
