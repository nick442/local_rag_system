All States have property tax, all States except 4 have sales tax, and business tax is federal but there are local costs of doing business such as various state required insurances and license and payroll taxes and unemployment insurance for the state etc. What I was talking about is personal income tax there are 2 kinds federal that everyone pays then all the states except those I listed take another 4 or 5% give or take which stays in the state instead of being sent off to the feeding government. From a business perspective if the going rate for paying your employees based on their role was say 100k annually. The employees take home pay would be taxed 5k in a state with income tax. That would mean Amazon would need to offer 5k more pay for an equal job vs an employer in another state. This is just one factor a company this huge would consider when moving.
