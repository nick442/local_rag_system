> Though I'd counter that if your goal is to manipulate economic exchanges between individuals with the intention of guiding the economy at large to a specific desired outcome, I think that capitalism is not the economic system for you :P You are very mistaken. Capitalism is all about incentives. Don't confuse capitalism with anarchism. The government is very important in capitalism as establishing the rules of the market and playing the referee role.
