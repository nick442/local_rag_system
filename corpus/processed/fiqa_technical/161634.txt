"You are not serious! You are asking strangers ""how should I go about it?"" and ""what can I use?"" If you are serious, study and research how you start a business. Also, try to design ONE cigarette lighter, make a small quantity and try to sell it. Then, you can check if want to start that business and how to start it."
