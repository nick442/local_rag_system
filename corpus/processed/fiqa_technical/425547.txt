What killed TiVo is the cable monopoly. Their business is tied to a service that a competitor has control over. I have a TiVo in my house. Comcast charges me $8.00 to use it, plus $2.00 for the cablecard inside. I had looked into a second unit, but Comcast told me this would be *another* $10/month. On top of the monthly TiVo bill, of course. Now I'm thinking of dropping both cable and TiVo.
