"There is so much wrong in what you wrote. A) You keep saying that it isn't right or good to do what you are advocating, implying that you are being forced to do it. The laws of capitalism are not ironclad, we live in a society that gives us the means to set ground rules. And even without these ground rules, a company could decide to set a higher standard, and many have in the past. B) The existence of outsourcing doesn't apply here. You can't outsource a walmart cashier. C) Even if outsourcing was part of the equation just saying ""well it is all fucked"" isn't the answer. There are ways around this from fighting for labor rights across the world, to less savory ideas like tariffs. D) WTF does ""fiscally sensible (although not so much in the United States, in some cases)"" even mean? You seem to be implying that the US is horribly fiscially irresponsible in comparison to other countries. Have you heard of: Greece, Ireland, Portugal, and Spain? Also, going back to your argument that fair labor laws are impossible have you looked at Germany? Edit: Also, Walmart employees are unionized everywhere outside of North America."
