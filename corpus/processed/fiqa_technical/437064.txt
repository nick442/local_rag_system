This was excellent. VCs buy amazing ideas and people all the time for so little. It was good to see someone who knows what their idea and execution are worth and stick to their guns. I see small businesses sell for 2x revenue all the time and then flip on IPO for 10-20x earnings after some growth. When you have a good team and process, let it ride.
