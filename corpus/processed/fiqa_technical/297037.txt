I understand your process. I just don't think many people on Reddit have put together a $100M loan. Hell not a lot of people period have done that. I'd think the council or banks you are working with would have that experience. When in doubt, just do what I do. Find something for a $1M loan and add a few zero's to it! You mentioned the cold storage business - something I am very interested in.
