">Do you think that someone like GM does not create any indirect jobs? GM is basically just a final assembler of components made by others. During it's PEAK employment years, GM largely owned and manufactured the vast majority of it's own components. Of course there were still a lot of raw materials suppliers, as well as minor component suppliers -- but the GM of 1970 was a far different (and much more vertically integrated) operation than it was just a decade or two later. >Furthermore, the comment about worldwide employment misses the mark here. The west is outsourcing our manufacturing. Yes, but you need to dig deeper than ""cheap labor"" for the reasons WHY. A lot of it has to do with the post 1971 fiat dollar and the advent of ""leveraging everything in sight"" (in part as an absurd inflation-hedge, and in part because finance saw a way of profiteering off the sale of the ""birthright"" assets -- selling the farms out from underneath the farmers so to speak) -- and subsequently firms needed to make substantially MORE than their previous profit margins in order to cover the interest costs, etc. >We, on the other hand, are doing the opposite. We're going to end up with no middle class. The only jobs available here will be for a small number of very highly specialized skills (like hedge fund managers) and the people who mow their lawns. No, eventually the dollar will either become so watered down (if it doesn't collapse entirely); along with an increase in the cost of overseas labor AND a rising expense of goods transport (in many ways only possible on large, bulk scales) -- will create a different scenario, one in which manufacturing (which has NOT entirely left the US by any means) will stage a comeback.. but it will be a long slow climb back, and we are probably a decade (or more) before the tide turns."
