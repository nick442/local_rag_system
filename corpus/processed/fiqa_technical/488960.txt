>Currency has value because it can be used to pay taxes. It would be very hard to do something such as sell a car without currency. You would have to find someone who not only wanted your car, but who had enough stuff that was directly useful to you, that they could trade for the full value of your car. Like, you can't sell one car to a bunch of people who have smaller things that you want, you can only sell it to an individual who has exactly that collection of stuff that you want.
