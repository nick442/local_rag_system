How does increasing the company's profits get helped by paying for employees to fly domestically in first? Many have business class policies for flying to other continents (although never first, just business class). I have flown a plenty of domestic/international first class, and it is fascinating that most of those in paid fares in first are government workers, and non profit employees along with the odd retiree. The rest are usually there on free upgrades, friends/family of airline employees and those that paid with miles.
