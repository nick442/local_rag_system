I think one of the problems is bubbles convince people that they aren't in a bubble. Happens over and over and over. People standing back and saying, you know this might be a bubble get ignored most of the time right until it is too late. There have been bubbles for a loong time and in so many things it seems silly that people don't spot them near immediately.
