>Genetic analysis of a tumor is less than a minute. Uh.. right. Too bad that's biologically, chemically, and physically impossible. Reading and analyzing DNA is limited by enzyme speed and it must be done hundreds of times to get an accurate reading. You could jump 5000 years into the future and they still wouldn't be able to read an analyze a patient's genome in under a minute.
