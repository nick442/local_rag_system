No. If McDonalds becomes liable for this sort of thing it means that it will have to cover its ass. That means basically taking over hr from the franchisees and directly supervise their day to day operations. Will McDonald's corporate pay for this? Hell no, the franchises will. This will render many of the franchises totally unprofitable and leave them with only one interested buyer, McDonald's corporate which can buy the franchises at firesale prices. Not that they want this, the model of actually owning your restaurants looks way shittier on a corporate balance sheet to investors.
