>>The US remains wedded to its allegedly free market leanings despite revelations that JP Morgan, among others, receives $14 BILLION a year in government subsidies. I don't think you'd get much more argument from American taxpayers (big or small) that subsidies if/when they are justified should come with requirements to make sure the public interest is truly being served. What is less clear is that holding stock in businesses that the government has decided to subsidize means the government should control the pay of the parent company's execs. Disclaimer: I identify conservative with libertarian leanings and do not (to the best of my knowledge) own stock in any bank or bank-like entity
