"Summarized article: In Canada, Jennifer Desloges, owner of an electrolysis business, is accusing Yelp, a user review website, of hurting businesses by burying positive reviews and lowering ratings. Desloges encouraged her customers to post real comments about her business on the Yelp site. 17 customers posted positive reviews which boosted her rating to 5 stars but her rating later dropped to 2 1/2 stars when some positive reviews were filtered out. Yelp uses an algorithm to filter out reviews by users who don't write reviews as often and are not ""trusted"" users. The intent is to filter out fake reviews by those trying to manipulate the system. Yelp explained that although Desloges received genuine reviews, they were likely filtered out because they were from infrequent Yelp users. Desloges says the low Yelp rating is causing her to lose potential customers. Other small business owners have also complained about Yelp's filtering system. Some tried suing Yelp because they claimed Yelp was manipulating user reviews to force them to advertise. The judge said there was no proof of the claims and dismissed the case. *For more summarized news, subscribe to the [/r/SkimThat](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkimThat) subreddit*"
