How's your savings and emergency fund? Everyone should have an emergency fund that will last them 6 months, and the goal should be two years' worth. This should be in an easily accessible account, such as a savings or money market account at your bank (you could consider CDs, but unless you're laddering them there will be penalties to get at the money). Once you've got 6 months' worth saved, the next thing to focus on is a tax advantaged retirement account. Only when you've maxed out your contributions (and the tax benefits) should you consider other investments. After all, those tax benefits are free money from Uncle Sam :)
