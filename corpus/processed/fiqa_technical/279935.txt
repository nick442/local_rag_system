"I reread my comment and I've yet to understand what you're referencing when you state I've insulted someone. I made the comment ""unless you're an idiot and tell on yourself"". At no point did I say that the person I was responding too was an idiot or that any person in particular was as well. Sorry if you've upset yourself but I did not intend to insult anyone by my comment."
