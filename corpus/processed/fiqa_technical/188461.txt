What you're looking for is expected value. Let's say you invest $1000 in option A, and later discover that you are going to lose 20%. So the expected value of option A is $800. If option B has a 50% chance of losing 50%, and a 50% of gaining 20%, then your expected value is $650 ($650 = $1000 * (50% * 50% + 50% * 20%)). $800 > $650, so you should stay with option A. In the real world, you usually don't know the exact odds and percentages, so substitute in your best guesses. This may lead to suboptimal results, but only if your estimations are wrong; the formula itself is ideal.
