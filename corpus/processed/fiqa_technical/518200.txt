Hmm, others are hating on the article, but from my experience, there is truth there. Every single tiny company that's trying to hire you as a young coder will dangle the possibility of a massive upside later on - the founder/CEO believes that success is just around the corner, and a good one has the ability to charm everyone else into believing it, too. Alas, this is not a guarantee of success. So I think if you're in that position - young coder trying to pick a job, or decide whether to stick with one - the advice is this: if you're not sure whether you know what you're doing, you probably don't, in which case look at the base odds (1 in 100 startups succeed, the rest crater) and act accordingly. If you *are* sure you know what you're doing, then more power to you.
