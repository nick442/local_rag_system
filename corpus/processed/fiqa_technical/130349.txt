"My idea if I had it done would make way over $200,000. $200,000 would only scratch the surface if the business got started up. You sir are the actual idiot for acting like you know everything about my idea without any evidence whatsoever. The idea has 100% never been done before, and that's a fact. You can't call someone's idea a terrible one without knowing what it is so I will keep going for my goal because people like you will come and go as much as you please. I said ""I'm confident my business would be successful"" you don't need research to have hope and determination. I pity the guy who went out of his at in an attempt to discourage my dream. I hope to get back to you after my business gets the wheels rolling, so I can take everything you just said to me and shove it up your ass while you continue to hate on everything and everyone. Fuck face"
