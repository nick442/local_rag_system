There are Education Training Quality Assurance bodies (ETQAs) in different sectors responsible for the accreditation of providers. Training providers would be accredited by one ETQA on the basis of primary focus. The provider would need to decide which ETQA sector the provider falls within and then which are the NQF standards or qualifications that it wishes to provide.
