>People with demanding, manual labor jobs (probably the only way to get enough calories for that kind of work -- none of them were fat) Most men can eat 2300-2500 calories in a day with out much exercise, and a Whopper is a whole 660 calories. Most sandwiches at any chain restaurant are more than that. Not one salad at Applebees is less than 1000 calories. People have no idea what their calorie intake is.
