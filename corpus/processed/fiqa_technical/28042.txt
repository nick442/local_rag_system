> If your studies are, say, 150K Why? You could spend that much but you could spend a lot less. [Room and board plus tuition and fees averages 21.5K / year at a state university](http://youngadults.about.com/od/finances/qt/publicschcosts.htm) So 90K would be a much better estimate. > and you forego another 60K/y during 4 years of university, Why that number? [Median annual earnings for someone with a high school diploma was 25K.](http://money.cnn.com/2011/10/26/pf/college/college_tuition_cost/index.htm) Your estimate is almost 2 1/2 times the median. Also, many college students work while going to college, reducing that differential further. But even if we take your numbers, they add up to a differential of 390K (150 + 4 * 60), although 185 (85 + 4 * 25) would be closer to the median. > you will need to make roughly 39K more per year until you retire than you otherwise would have, 39K * 40+ years is roughly 390K? I don't know where the 39K per year comes from.
