Definitely makes sense, though it's nothing I know about. My approach would be: research online (Google, find interviews, look at LinkedIn, Vault guides, WSO forums) how people get those jobs & what exactly they entail. Then see (LinkedIn history, etc) how they got there, and find a pattern. Then talk to some (alums of your college, family friends, friends of friends, etc). Then you'll have a much better idea of what you need to do and how to do it.
