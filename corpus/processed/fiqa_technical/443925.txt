The way I read this, you've been effectively paying $100 per month toward a $5,000 loan at $10% per year. Excluding the fact that there is another balance attached to the loan. After 36 months there's roughly $2,718 remaining on the $5,000, assuming there have been no late fees etc and your $100 is all that's being applied to your balance.
