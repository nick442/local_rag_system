">Also, they didn't mean ""make money from thin air"" in the sense of it being a magical trick. They make money from a sort of market inefficiency: they broker between people who want to invest money and those who want to borrow it. They actually do make money ""from thin air"" when they make new loans. They're not disintermediating - they have a license to create new money and they use it. This is not something especially *sinister* - just how it works. Equally, when bank loans are paid off, that money that was created out of thin air is again destroyed. There is evidence also, that demand deposits do not really restrict lending, as they are supposed to.
