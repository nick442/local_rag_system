You'll almost never be able to patent an app idea. When it comes to software you almost always just have to accept that others are going to be able to copy your idea, so to protect your business you have to do it either a) First, and well enough to lock in a first mover advantage or b) Better than others can You haven't said if you're a coder or not, but generally if you can develop a MVP version of it before going to Kickstarter, that's much, much better. Almost no one is going to back a Kickstarter that just has an app idea. After that, learn as much as you can about online marketing. Don't assume that just because you have a good idea the app will take off. Getting users is hard, very hard.
