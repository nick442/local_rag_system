their only real competition at this point are places like Amazon.com, which treat their employees just as shitty, but people like deliveries where they don't see the workers wallowing in their misery. I'm not saying never shop at places, but we should be pushing for workers rights reforms. Its clear the invisible hand of the market is not able to force companies to be ethical when there aren't enough jobs for people to run to that are.
