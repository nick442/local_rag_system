"You are literally claiming ammonia isn't bad for people. That's a claim. If you want to provide proof, then that's fine, but don't claim something without providing evidence. And ""they have been doing it for years, so it must be okay"" isn't good enough. Also, I think it's banned in Europe and Canada, so why don't they think's it's safe?"
