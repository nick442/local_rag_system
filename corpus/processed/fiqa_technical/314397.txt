Has the VIX always received this much attention? I feel like I never really saw articles on it until about 2 years ago, and the attention has especially ramped up post election. Granted, I'm young and may have just not been aware. As the post alludes to, I think a big problem is people's interpretation of VIX being the market expectation of volatility. In a mathematical sense, that would only be valid if 1) the price of options perfectly reflects volatility, and 2) investors can rationally evaluate the future. (1) is arguable as volatility is just the single free parameter in BS and captures all confounded factors in the price, including supply/demand mismatches. (2) is debatable just because it essentially assumes that the wisdom of crowds will be true on average. My prior on this is that they're correct that often, and that the VIX is probably a pretty poor predictor of future realized volatility. I'll check this last claim and edit.
