Most modern airports have a fairly complex array of GPS and sensors that allows aircraft to automatically land. As far as take off goes, I'm not sure if that is automatic. Still, I'd rather have a trained pilot on board if there were an emergency since the aircraft can't land itself without the sensors from the airport.
