> After the NYT drummed up war in Iraq I've been done with that paper. They failed when we needed them the most. This should really be the #1 comment on this thread. When it comes to important topics like international affairs, they're more of a propaganda rag than a source of serious journalism or analysis. I haven't taken them seriously since 2003, and what I do come across from them now and again on reddit is usually very biased (pro-American government).
