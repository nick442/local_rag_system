I'm not sure why people are down voting you. There is no question the math and stats will be more intensive than what I used as an undergrad, but most of the programs I have talked to haven't suggested taking calc 3. But then again the programs i'm applying for aren't quant focused ones, defiantly not as quant heavy as a MS in comp finance would be. Just curious, if your already at a BB how come you decided to go back for the MS and not an MBA?
