"You definitely need more information. This could be a number of things. First of all I don't understand the reason for the 48 hours. I would definitely ask them to clarify why this is the case. Why are they noticing this a year later? You are indeed a participant in the company 401k. the plan is theirs, and you are agreeing to play by their rules when you enroll. I would call HR and get more info. This could be excess contribution or a ""bank error in your favor"" that they have found. It sounds like they over matched your 401k sense they want the money back."
