OP: >People really donâ€™t like to hear success explained away as luck My point in bringing up my wife's experience is that she started far back in the race behind me and has through sheer will and determination achieved more, earns more and has a better job than me. I have a friend from Kenya who started life without parents or shoes. He's more successful than me because he works ten times harder than I ever have. Luck has nothing to do with it. There is no such thing as luck. Luck is an imaginary force we use to explain things we don't understand, sound familiar? Those who do not work hard like to attribute the success others to luck and random chance, and are loath to admit they aren't trying as hard as they could be.
