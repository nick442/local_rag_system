"> I am shorted almost 50% of the market rate for others in the same field. The bitch of it is if I left for a year and came back, they probably would pay me that difference, maybe even more. This happens surprisingly often. Companies will ""anchor"" your compensation based on your starting salary and the distribution of salaries within your pay grade. So even if circumstances change significantly (e.g. you gain a Master's degree, or take on additional responsibility) your compensation tends to change only gradually. Sadly, you're also right that often your only real option is to take your talents elsewhere. In fact, I've even read this as ""career advice"" - I'd say it's an open secret that biggest pay-bumps in your career will come when you change employers."
