What you just said doesn't make any sense. The prices of goods and services are set to suit our income levels. We make a choice about how we spend our income. I don't think a road sweeper should be expected to pay 5 times more land value tax, just because the area they live is now a favourite with wealthy people, with golf courses and wine bars they can't afford to use and outrageous house prices. Land Value tax would just exacerbate the problems of real estate bubbles.
