>But those taxes are used to pay for labor, in most cases. The real question is if that labor created something that anyone wanted When ou buy eggs from someone who raises chickens, he will invest that money in his business and more people will get his eggs. The money is MULTIPLIED. He will spend the money you paid him, but at the same time he will have more chickens producing more eggs. When you spend your money paying taxes, the guy who does the paperwork will not be creating anything the people wants. He's a parasite.
