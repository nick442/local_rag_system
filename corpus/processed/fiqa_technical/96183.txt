"I'm obviously not trying to shift towards a fact-based analysis, because this is a political topic with no established right answer. There is no fact that shows taxing the rich is good or bad. It's a political opinion. Anyone who brings ""facts"" in at this level is simply trying to declare themselves correct. And my point isn't that Republicans are bad, but that they are covering their harmful economic policies with helpful ones. The obvious implication isn't that they are bad people, but that we should be critical of their bad policies and applaud their good ones."
