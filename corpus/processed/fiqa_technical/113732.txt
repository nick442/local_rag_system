"Interesting article! I feel like it focuses a little heavy on that line in the 10-K though, that doesn't seem terribly uncommon. Seems like the article is trying to do a ""gotcha"" bit with it. I think the story of the disappearing executives is much more interesting without bringing the generic 10-K disclaimers into it at all."
