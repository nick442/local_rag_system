Take your time. When I started my business I thought I had a killer name at first and a few weeks later I found a much better one. Brainstorm with your partners. For an internet business having a short domain name is going to matter, and you should really try to get a .com. A .us or .io are also good, but if the .com is already taken people will confuse them for you so it's good to get the .com first. Make sure you don't have any weird characters in your domain like hyphens which are harder to type on a mobile device.
