"If we are only talking about a few extra months between jobs which is quite common now then how do you get to ""living beyond their means""? Either they have unemployment insurance or they don't. It sounds like you don't like unemployment insurance. So go bring that to a vote. So far the majority of people want unemployment insurance in place because they see greater economic benefit in providing this service."
