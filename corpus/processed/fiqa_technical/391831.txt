I just wish people who hate on keynesian policies (which while not perfect, are not as terrible as people point them out to be) would at least acknowledge that Keynes advocated maintaining budget surpluses when the economy is doing fine/alright. For me the major catalysts for the recession were: * Low interest rates despite rising real estate prices which encouraged risky investments. * Two expensive wars Anything else was salt on the wounds really.
