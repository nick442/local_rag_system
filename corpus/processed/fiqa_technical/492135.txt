A good chunk of it is going into new construction, campus improvements, and infrastructure. If they cut that crap out then I bet costs would actually decline year over year for a little while. It's stupid - they all get their college rankings and a good part of that is how nice their campus/facilities are. Easy way to boost that is just raise tuition, build new shit.
