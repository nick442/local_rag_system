"Plenty of links around, under the ""monetization"" heading. However my understand came from a local app developer who's done a number of presentations. He's been tweaking and trying to find new ways to develop his now quite successful app, with the aim of earning enough that he doesn't have to work doing databases. What he found was that ranking in app searches was dependent on downloads, and revenues (paid or ads) were dependent on total installs. Therefore if you go the paid app way, you don't get the downloads to get placement on search returns, so you don't get downloads - a negative spiral. In addition it's another barrier to get your potential user over. Thus you want free as the initial price. You can try the freemium route - but it really depends on continued usage rate. If people are to buy it in-app, then then need to regularly use it (and it has to be designed this way). But if you do this, you can get regular ad revenue as well - it might not be much, but it adds up. Hence his statement was to design to have high value ads built in to the way the app works, and allow people to also pay to get rid, or add new functionality."
