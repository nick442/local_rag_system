"Hahaha! I'm in the same boat! I have been hunting for a well priced WRX wagon for a while now and whenever I call some place asking about them (which has inevitably sold a day or two prior of course), they always respond with ""But maybe we can find something here for you!"" Of course you can.. if you guys carry a manual AWD Hatchback ""performance"" car? It's typically followed by silence."
