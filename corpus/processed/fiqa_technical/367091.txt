Lobbyists encourage legislators to add clauses to bills that help their clients save money on taxes or avoid taxes. The income tax on hedge fund managers is a good example of that. Some lobbyist actually craft the legislation and then give it to the legislator to get passed. In the case of Manafort he may be responsible for the mysterious disappearance of a plank in the GOP platform. There was a plank calling for the arming of the Ukrainians which Putin and Viktor Yanukovich wanted removed. It was removed and nobody claims to know how it happened.
