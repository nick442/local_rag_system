"PC MasterCard recently added this as a new feature to their online system. It lets you see ""Pending Authorizations"" for your card when you log in. Their email said: Along with your purchases, you'll see a list of every transaction that's been approved, but not yet applied to your balance. You'll be able to identify these with the word “Pending” in the date column. Here's a link with more information: http://pcfinancial.ca/pendingauthorization/"
