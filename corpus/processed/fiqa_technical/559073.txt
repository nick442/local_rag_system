Manufacturing *employment*. Manufacturing *output* has increased. The people who used to be employed in manufacturing are slowly being shuffled to places where they can be more productive rather than taking up space in jobs where they have become extraneous due to productivity gains. This means a lot of retraining is necessary but there's really little alternative. This has nothing whatsoever with the growth potential of the economy, so I'm not sure why you brought it up.
