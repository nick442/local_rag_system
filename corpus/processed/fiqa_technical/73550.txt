This isn't an impressive headline, nor does it show amazing investment foresight, because they were a non-entity. Investing in them back then would have consisted of picking one of hundreds of companies with a good idea and the hope of someday becoming profitable, but risky as hell. A WSB. A better headline for Netflix, and one that actually teaches a lesson on how to properly invest would be: **$1,000 in Netflix 6 years ago worth $16K today.** Around 2010, I was disappointed in myself for not grabbing NFLX earlier on, but didn't want to buy because I didn't think it had much upside.. a little overpriced from what I saw. Then in 2011, they made the stupid Qwikster announcement. Everyone bitched and moaned, and the stock price plummeted. I said to myself - is anyone actually canceling their subscription over this? Who exactly is the competition, the cable company who's 5-10x the price? Hulu, who have commercials? How could their profits really suffer from this?? I couldn't see any way where they wouldn't claw it back once the dust settled. I bought 150 shares right away. Classic investment example of not succumbing to market panic and getting a good buy. (Just wish I hadn't sold half my shares after the stock tripled!)
