i dont suppose elon's intention is to make money. which ironically is one of the reasons he will succeed. turning a quick buck business model wont work for an industry disrupter like telsa. right now they are getting the early adopters to fund the tech for more readily affordable cars. the money made is reinvested in r&d. they need a few breakthroughs before things take off, its a long term strategy. investing in tesla isnt for everybody, but the few people with enough forsight to put some money into this concept could be looking at very large gains. its kinda like investing in apple when steve jobs was just a crazy smelly hippy.
