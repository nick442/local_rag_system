Employees were already cashing out their RSUs and selling stock on private markets. >Even if Facebook could resist, an eager army of Facebook employees is pushing hard for an I.P.O., according to Eric Eldon of TechCrunch. In 2008, Facebook adopted a new restricted stock program that prevented employees from selling their shares until an I.P.O. or a sale, or if Facebook permitted it. They still could have stayed private if they really wanted to. They were compensating employees in stock, and those employees wanted to cash out. The underwriters wanted to cash out before the financials became open to public scrutiny.
