I don't know how other people regard ZH; but I read it along with many other financial blogs for my dose of news. The magnitude of the loss shouldn't be surprising to people though. [As early as mid-May, JPMorgan Chase suspended a $15 billion stock repurchase plan that was only approved two months previously in March.](http://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/JPM/key-developments/article/2544789). $15 billion is a big (much too big) reserve for a (claimed by the media at the time) supposedly $2 billion loss. It was only a matter of time before that loss was going to get much, much bigger.
