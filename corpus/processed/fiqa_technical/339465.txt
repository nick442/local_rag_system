Taxes should never be hated. It should be an honor to contribute toward the common good of the nation. It used to be this way until they were made into a political weapon. Our nation used to raise taxes when we held debt and lower taxes when debt was low. Instead, this bullshit idea that taxes are bad was crammed down peoples throats, and now we're sitting at a significant debt that really started to take off with Reagan.
