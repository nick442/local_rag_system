don't blame china, look at yourselves in the mirror Stupmerica. nobody put a gun to your head to move your manufacturing to china. china just a scapegoat for the greed and incompetence of US corporations and US government. The US multinational are making out like bandits, while the avg chinese worker still make peanuts, the factory boss makes peanuts compared to the avg american ceo, where did all the wealth transfer go to? Wall street and golden parachutes. and dat's the truth. China can't revalue its currency, too much depends on a low yuan, unless it wants its factories to close overnight and have mass rioting. idiot economists, best think befo you open your damn moufs, foo.
