"the education bubble is similar to the mortgage bubble..you have people with no stake in the game, making huge financial decisions the customers aren't the ones paying, so it makes perfect sense for them to charge through the ass for an ""education"". What needs to happen is that college loans should be suspended for subpar colleges..we as tax payers, shouldn't be on the hook for $100,000 for a worthless degree.(and it does add up to $25K/yr for most of these shitty schools) Simply create grading tiers. Something like Harvard gets an A, something like Rutgers gets a B, something like a county community college gets a C, and University of Phoenix etc get an F. Then simply withdraw public loans from any school graded an F. If someone wants to go to a shitty school, make them make the decision where it's their money that's at stake. When you do that, you'll suddenly notice people skipping the degree mills and just going to small local schools that actually give a degree worth something"
