It's up to him to provide for himself. Hiring a hitman(Govt) to steal for him is not moral. Just because you have modest skills and work full time doesn't mean you are increasing productivity and filling a customer need. That is why it's up to a free and mutual agreement between two people to determine your income. This will grow the pie and increase standard of living for all. Otherwise if we steal from an engineer (who increases productivity) and give it to a modestly skilled full time dog walker (doesn't increase productivity) then people will just walk dogs instead of innovating new things that will increase all of our standard of livings.
