"Anecodotal but par for the course for being in /all , my vegan buddy gets food from here often, probably the only fast food other than french fries. Order any item fresco style and they'll replace cheese and sauces with pico-digio. No meat, makes that vegan. It's also fairly easy to tell them what you want on your buritto "" bean burrito, fresco style, add black beans and rice"" $1.45"
