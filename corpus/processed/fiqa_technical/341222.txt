> if higher skill jobs like IT are being outsourced for the sake of saving money, you can bet your ass that the lowly unskilled labor positions will be the first to go. Guys this ain't new, and its not news. Outsourcing has been going on for decades, and tons if not all of the unskilled blue collar jobs are gone. Yet we still have 5% unemployment and a drastic shortage of skilled programers, mathematicians, scientists, physicists etc. Globalization isnt a bad thing.
