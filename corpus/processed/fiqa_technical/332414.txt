I don't see how it's that weird. If you have $40 worth of stock or $40 in cash it's essentially the same thing when measuring your wealth. The difference it that assets like stocks have more volatility in their value most the time. As for Bill Gates, it's hard to hide too much wealth. If you hide money in your mattress and don't spend it it's really not useful as money. That's an over simplification but you see my point.
