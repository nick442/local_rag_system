The taxi industry operates differently in every jurisdiction. I live in Vancouver BC and the taxi business here is archaic (think transportation before deregulation) so I would welcome Uber as an alternative. There is a reason a license to operate a cab in Vancouver is worth $500,000+ each. Monopolies, bitch.
