"Following these rules will help a poor person have a better chance to climb out of poverty or avoid poverty. Not finishing high school isn't going to help them find a good job. Having children as a teenager isn't going to put a poor person into the middle class. Having children without being married and having a full time job isn't going to solve poverty, but make it worse. You call these rules ""middle class values"" as if it is a bad thing, and speak of them as an imposition. Well, breaking these rules is pretty much a ticket to generational poverty."
