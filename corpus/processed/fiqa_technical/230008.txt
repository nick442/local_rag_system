Yeah, we had a guy do something similar at my job with a 'back problem' He kept pushing off his return date later and later because of 'new issues and new tests'. Eventually the bosses got tired of dealing with it and filled his position, so as soon as he finally comes back to work he'll get a pink slip. This is the #1 reason I can see businesses not wanting to hire women of 'childbearing age', to quote the article. It's an expense they can easily avoid. Why pay thousands of dollars for an employee who isn't there, when you can hire someone who (probably) won't leave for as long/cost the company as much. Logically they have no incentive to hire the women, because the company sees them as a liability.
