"Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Ever dealt with a scummy lawyer? A greedy real estate agent? A sketchy car mechanic?? Ever had a relative get their computer ""fixed"" by geek squad? Ever heard of a crooked cop? Did you ever elect a politician to do something.. that they then didn't do? Ever have a girl turn psycho on you and accuse you of abuse? Ever seen a guy lie and cheat on his girl? And we haven't even discussed plain old ordinary criminals that rob you with a smile as you simply try to go home one night. Hint: people of all types routinely display poor judgement and morals. Honestly people, think about what your typing. I'm in Finance and I'll be the first to call out all the crime and BS. But stop pretending the rest of the world isn't just as corrupt."
