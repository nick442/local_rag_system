Yeah, so both of those are not true. Cutting funding for these things drastically alters their ability to provide services, and the Department of Energy, Department of Education, the EPA -- they all provide urgently needed services. Its not just budget cuts either. Changing policy to reduce efficacy, purposefully understaffing, eliminating the scientists ability to convey findings to the public. It's gotten noticeably harder to access govt data since this administration started dismantling these orgs.
