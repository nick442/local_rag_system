> He risked a lot in the beginning.. You avoided my question. Your position is that entrepreneurs deserve great reward because they take on great risk. I disagree. When failure means moving out of your mansion and into a suburban neighborhood, I think that hardly qualifies as risk. Compare that to a single mom who only makes enough money to pay for food or heat. That seems like risk. Now consider President Trump. His companies filed for bankruptcy four times but he was able to insulate his wealth from those failures. Is that really risk or just being rich?
