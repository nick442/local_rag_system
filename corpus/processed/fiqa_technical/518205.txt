Seconding u/AgentScreech, I would suggest to do some serious research and putting together a business plan before engaging in a venture like this. A bowling alley is not exactly an agile business, there are plenty of fixed costs. You have to know exactly why the place is closing, and figure out a way to reverse the situation. In addition to leverage you local community, you can also try to diversify the business model. Find new streams of income from products/services, change the place to engage new potential clients, etc.
