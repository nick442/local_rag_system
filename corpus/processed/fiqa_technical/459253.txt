I think you definitely have a shot then. There are people who come from a wide variety of backgrounds at my firm, not strictly finance people and not strictly programmers either. We have statistics majors, folks with experience in machine learning/natural language processing, and so on. Find a proprietary trading firm or a hedge fund looking for someone with a hard sciences and quantitative background. You might have to go for a slightly junior role, but it will certainly take advantage of the skills you bring to the table and I'm sure you can come up to speed on the rest (things like P&L attribution, portfolio modeling, transaction cost analysis etc.).
