All of those approaches will help you establish upper and lower bounds for a valuation. The amount of uncertainty you have makes the upper and lower bounds insanely wide.

Why would they waste their time with a DCF? Sure, you can calculate incremental value saved or a hundred different metrics but at the end of the day this is a bet that you only get to make once, it would be very tough to gamble with any degree of statistical confidence here. If they got to buy 100 whatapps' they might be able to do something but in this context it's a clear bet on strategy and it's that. Forecasting future cashflows is notoriously difficult even with stable firms, trying this with a new firm that's practically a venture bet would be a waste of everyone's time. Zuckerberg made a $20bn bet that this company would allow them to stay in peoples lives online and that can be sold to advertisers."
