From what I understand, Japan has a great consumer goods industry and a sealed off food industry (they do not import rice and I seriously doubt anyone can supply seafood in their domestic market cheaper than they can) so it could be that they don't even really need to import that much at all. At the end of the day, that stockpiled wealth is still wealth we don't have that the Japanese people can rely upon I'm not talking about a voluntary financial constraint like the arbitrary 90% debt:gdp policy! I'm saying let's actually figure out a method for determining our constraints scientifically in real time, and adapt our policy accordingly!
