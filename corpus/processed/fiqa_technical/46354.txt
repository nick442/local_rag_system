"> This seems like correlation and not causationâ€¦ somebody who'll never overdraw their account won't bother getting overdraft protection. I would actually say that makes it a causation rather than merely a correlation. Why? Because people who sign up for overdraft protection are LESS likely to be careful/conscientious about their account balances or their spending habits (see they have ""overdraft protection"" so why worry?) .. and therefore more likely to overdraw their accounts (and to do so frequently). By contrast people who do *not* have (or reject) overdraft protection are more likely to monitor their account balances and control/limit their spending in order to maintain a healthy balance. BTW, I highly doubt this is ""news"" to the banks: they are almost certainly well aware of the phenomenon.. which is one reason they promote their ""overdraft protection"" thingees."
