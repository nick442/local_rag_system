"I wrote the whimsically titled ""The Density of Your IRA"" to discuss this exact issue. In the 25% bracket, your pretax 401(k) would have $18,000, with a future tax due. But the Roth effectively took $24,000 in pretax dollars, and put the $18K in post tax money in the account. Since the limits are the same, the Roth is a denser account."
