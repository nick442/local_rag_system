It sounds good on paper, the problem is licensing fees paid to foreign subsidiaries for IP and trademark use. That's how Apple makes 80% of it's revenue in the US and still makes 80% of it's profit in Ireland. If the US doesn't take foreign income into account, every multinational would offshore their profits the same way. Many do it now, and the loop hole isn't as big as people are advocating for.
