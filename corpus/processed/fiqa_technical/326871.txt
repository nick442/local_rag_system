"Paul calls it unanimous. The government site does not. What does a unanimous voice vote even mean? [Here is the govt site where the votes are viewable](http://oversight.house.gov/markup/full-committee-business-meeting-30/). Note at the bottom that the **postal bills** have the statement ""Outcome: Favorably reported to the House of Representatives by **unanimous** consent"". Note that **bill 459 does not** state that. Watch the video and you'll see that Ron Paul has a little bit of trouble with reality."
