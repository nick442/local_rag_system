Exactly, the way you phrase the question makes it too vague to explain. Futures are very complicated instruments, and you should not be going after futures contracts if you are not educated in exactly how they work. I recommend getting a text on [derivative markets](http://books.google.com/books?id=6fNJGQAACAAJ&dq=Fundamentals%20of%20Derivative%20Markets%20McDonald&source=gbs_book_other_versions) and learn all the ropes before jumping in at all.
