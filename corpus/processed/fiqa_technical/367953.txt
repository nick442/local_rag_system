As much as you would like to believe in American exceptionalism, I am afraid it is has come to an end. The Jews you love so much have taken over your government and sucked it dry, all you have is debt between your Treasury and your Jewish Fed. They will tax what little you have left. And then eventually history will replay its self in its inevitable cycle. What does America export, beside financial goobly gook and weapons, little else that is not made cheaper and better every where else and thats why you have a trade deficit. You can't even build a decent fucking car anymore. Your youth is no longer educated and your nation is now perpetually so stoned they don't have a fucking clue what is happening around them. You are involved in wars you cannot win, paying with money you do not have, trying to destabilize the Middle east and Muslim countries because the very same Jews that have infested you Political and economic system want to annex more land. You have no moral , religious, social or ethical structure left, in fact you no longer know whether your children should grow up as men or women or neither or either. Every world leader is laughing at you and openly making fun of you and now that you are exposed as supporters of ISIS and ISIL and whatever you want to call them, are leaving you and your alliances. Your government is openly corrupt and takes bribes from lobbyists and in the end the Biggest fucking moron that your country could produce has been installed as your president, regardless of who you voted for or wanted. Your President has only one fucking skill, declaring Bankruptcy and that is why he was chosen, to first insulate the Global economy from your Fed driven soon to be hyper inflated dollar and then bring the abomination straight down in another controlled demolition. You think you are coming out of this . . . .now that is wishful thinking
