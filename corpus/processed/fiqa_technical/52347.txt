If that's what you're into, then yeah. Having a deep interest in it or whichever discipline you follow is probably the most helpful aspect. I learned that the hard way by spending too much time trying to become a quant (the wall Street definition) and wish someone had told me about things information science, data visuslizatuon, or even something like ecommerce or search optimisation. All of which seem to be in even more demand that being a quant. I reccomened talking to some people in the field. Maybe your academic advisor could help with that. It's also good for networking.
