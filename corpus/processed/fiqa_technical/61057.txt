What subsidies are you talking about? From wikipedia: >>'The USPS has not directly received taxpayer-dollars since the early 1980s with the minor exception of subsidies for costs associated with the disabled and overseas voters' More like small businesses are grateful there is a service they don't have to pay excessive administrative taxes to use and are sad the greed in the US is going to wreck yet another piece. The value of privatization is such a horrible scam.
