Just found your comment as I was searching for 'judicial dissolution'. Depending on your state, your partner (by starting another business which is in direct competition to this business) has committed a breach of fiduciary duty, a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and maybe fraud. I am currently dealing with a similar situation. The solution that I am pursuing is judicial dissolution. I will say, does the business own the web domain name, or do you personally? In my case, I purchased the domain myself, and I am simply going to redirect to a similar (but different) domain, and claim it as a rebranding effort. It sucks. A lot. But it's a valuable lesson learned (for me, anyway). Best of luck.
