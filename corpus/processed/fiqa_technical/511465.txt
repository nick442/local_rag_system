Sprint is the cheapest of the top four providers because they offered a special plan called SERO that many people took advantage of. I have a SERO Premium plan that includes plenty of minutes and unlimited 4G data for $50/mo. The same plan would cost at least $95/mo with any other provider, including T-Mobile. The only way for Sprint to move forward is to dump their SERO users or greatly outnumber them with normally priced plans.
