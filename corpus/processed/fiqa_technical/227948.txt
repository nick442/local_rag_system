You should do it. It really can't hurt. But you really need someone young-ish (35-45) that is already successful and knows what the hell they're doing to read thru and critique it. Anyone can write a business plan, but that doesn't make it good. That said, if you can just DO, then just DO. Most entrepreneurs I know never wrote a business plan, they just focused on making the best thing and working hard at it. And providing good customer/client service. Try networking, too. If you are passionate and can present your idea in a good way, someone with 10k should stake you (like an angel investor).
