"I guess I should explain a little in detail since you really don't seems to understand why sometimes anecdotal evidences are not useful and why sometimes they are. It has nothing to do with economy sub or not, but rather simplw logic. Anecdotal evidences can be useful to refute universal claims theories. For example, if anyone claims that ""all swans are white"", then all it takes is one anecdotal observation of one black swan is enough to disprove this theory. There is no need to bring additional statistcally significant evidence in order to prove ""Not all swans are white"". In fact this is how lot's of theories were disproved by contracting observation. A lot of people keep hearing things about ""anecdotal"", but never truly understood why they are not significantly important in certain situations, thus making the mistake."
