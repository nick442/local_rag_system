Loving the discussion. I can't argue that new areas of the economy will open up and allow for some offset for those jobs lost through increasing productivity/efficiency, but I have a hard time believing that they can fully offset, but certainly anything is possible. Do you think that this push toward self employment can happen as fast as losses due to automation, or will there be some lag time? That lag time is where we (as a society) will feel massive pain, which, I argue is at least part of what we've been seeing in the last few years.
