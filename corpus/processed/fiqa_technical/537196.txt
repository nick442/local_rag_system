"I can't speak to this particular process, but I'm very well versed in putting together RFP (request for proposal) and Tenders (a term more frequently used in oil & gas). Basically, the customer puts out a document that says ""I want this widget constructed and built to this specification"". Then qualified bidders submit a proposals for the widget. Using this process is almost ubiquitous for large projects and for government contracts there is generally a legal process that must be followed. Within my organization, nearly every project >$100,000 must go through an RFP. For example, we just put our audit out to bid. 5 accounting firms responded and our Board's audit committee will select one of the bids. Aside from performing some diligence regarding the solvency of the accounting firm, the profitability of the contract for the accounting firm is not part of the selection criteria. And while we aren't under any obligation to select the ""low bid"", we will absolutely give additional weight to bids that provide the best value (aka cheaper). if you are curious about the generalities of the RFP process: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_proposal"
