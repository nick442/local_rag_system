"How can you dismiss this argument as political? That's not even a consideration when thinking about this. I think this based on what I've read--you keep saying ""look at the government data""--what the hell kind of vague BS is that? For example, Seth Klarman in his book ""Margin of Safety"" talks about the dangers of deregulation from an investment point-of-view. Perhaps even better, James Montier in ""Value Investing"" has pages and pages and data that show a clear pattern of widespread deregulation and the following bust. Going back to the late 80s S&L crisis, you do realize that banks were't able to invest in such speculative securities prior to the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act, right?"
