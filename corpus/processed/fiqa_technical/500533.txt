This is the sad fate of essentially all mature businesses under the conditions of American financial capitalism and, indeed, Whole Foods' executive team — led by its founder John Mackey — has been under intense pressure recently from an activist hedge fund that bought shares and has been agitating for cost cutting and more payouts.
