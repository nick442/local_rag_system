"Yeah, I understand that is a nebulous term, akin to stopping ""pork"" in various bills. However, getting back to that Economist article, this really stood out to me: > Americaâ€™s corporate tax has two horrible flaws. The first is the tax rate, which at 35% is the highest among the 34 mostly rich-country members of the OECD. Yet it raises less revenue than the OECD average thanks to myriad loopholes and tax breaks aimed at everything from machinery investment to NASCAR race tracks. Last year these breaks cost $150 billion in forgone revenue, more than half of what America collected in total corporate taxes. I'm not clear on where they got that number, but assuming it is true, there are certainly plenty of places we could start if we were to lower the tax rate to a sane level. Also, I still don't see how just lowering the tax rate and removing the repatriation tax on foreign earned profit would truly disincentivize inversion. If there are countries like Bermuda still out there with say, random number here, a 5% corporate tax, wouldn't the incentive still exist?"
