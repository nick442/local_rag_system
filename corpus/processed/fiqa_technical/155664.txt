I know, I also didn't do it justice. The guy came up with an attitude to start something. Like he was going to show us. I'm not the one to flip out on service people. I also have worked my entire career over 20 years in the service industry. So I know what it's like to get shit on as a service person. I just have little tolerance for uncalled for hostility.
