"> The system is designed.. Wouldn't that be more ""The union is designed..""? Why not just end the union's contract entirely and hire from outside the union? Or find a different union to negotiate with? Maybe someone wants to form a union of ""teachers who want to teach"" that focuses on job security for the best teachers, not the longest serving. I mean.. If I was negotiating for myself, I'd want merit based pay increases rather than seniority based. I'd probably also be asking that my health benefits be the same as the district administration. I might ask for a clause saying that I can't be fired unless all worse performing teachers have already been fired. (yeah.. about measuring that.. haven't figured that out yet.) I might also ask for some sort of third party policy for representation in the event that there's a need to lawyer up under circumstances where a conflict of interest exists between myself and the district. (the last of those -- the lawyer issue -- I've been told by at least one teacher that they feel that's the primary service the union provides. They hate the contract negotiations because they always seem to go to threats to strike before being resolved.) I guess it just seems weird to me that, once a union has formed, the union has a monopoly on providing the services. You'd think that some could join the union, while others could choose to operate independently. If the advantages of being in the union outweigh the advantages of being independent, then you'd expect everybody to join. A 51% vote to unionize seems like a terrible reason to bring the rest of the employees (and any new hire) along for the ride. It should be an individual's choice to be represented by the union and whether to accept the union terms or negotiate on their own."
