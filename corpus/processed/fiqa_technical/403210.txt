Many companies and careers there are no rungs. If you hire 20 roofers and 1 manager not all those 20 roofers will get to move up to management, it just can't happen. And being a good roofer does not make them a good manager, it is necessary to understand the job of the people you're managing but management is an entirely different skill set on it's own.
