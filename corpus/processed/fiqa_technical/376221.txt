> Owning an expensive home Why do people seem to think owning a home is expensive? Not everyone that owns a home is rich, or has an expensive home. Home ownership has many more benefits to renting, and the government should absolutely encourage it. It encourages people to take ownership in a community and brings down housing costs for everyone. People don't only rent apartments in high rises, you understand that, right? People rent two flats, houses, cabins, mansions, condos. Your view and knowledge of this is narrow at best.
