"You should come to Europe and learn the realities of those countries, not believe the narrative of the USA progressives. The nordic european countries started the XX century quite de-centralize and free market based. Over time they became more social-democrat and ended up suffering a systemic crisis during the 80's. Since then they have been de-regulating and de-centralizing and they have recovered. For example, in Sweden 30% of the roads are private or most of them have a system of voucheurs for education. Norway is an exception since they have petrol and can get away with stuff ""normal"" economies can not."
