>then employers will likely defer to candidates that they deem to be more mature. Recruiters go for fresh idealistic faces at college campuses, not jaded 30 somethings who probably won't *attempt* to give 110% their first 2-5 years on the job. That's how my industry (Accounting) works at least. Public Accounting likes to get them while they're young and idealistic, burn them out working ridiculous unpaid overtime, then discard the 98% who aren't deemed partner material. A 30-something who has worked a bunch of dead-end jobs for low pay isn't going to be as enthused to work a job where you get used and thrown away as they've been there and done that and know it doesn't really get you anywhere.
