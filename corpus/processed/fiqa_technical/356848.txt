"It's called ""rebadging"" the staff. Take them into the new outsourced company, cut benefits and have them train their Indian replacements, then layoff the us staff. I managed 66 developers around the world. India was the worst. They charge about $25k/for fully loaded fte, replacing someone at $100k all in."
