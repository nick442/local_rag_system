"You lose out still.. if you have a very disruptive student in the classroom who takes all of the teacher's attention just to deal with, the instruction of the other students may not be as good as the teacher could have delivered given a different set of students. You also need to account for things like engagement of the parents. Not all learning happens in the classroom, and some reinforcement of that learning needs to happen in the home. A student who refuses to do homework of any kind and who's parents accept or encourage that behavior is going to do worse than a student who's parents actively encourage doing homework and reward good performance in school. Oh.. and some of the implementations of ""No Child Left Behind"" encourage pacing to the slowest student rather than challenging all of them at the level they can be challenged. It's pretty broken."
