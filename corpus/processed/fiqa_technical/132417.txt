Aside from the averages mentioned by Jahlapenoez, it may also be useful to group depositors into different categories based on account size and transaction history (# of deposits, # of withdrawals, size of each, etc.) then track how those numbers change on whatever time periods you need to capture. Analysts can use that to see what's going on with outliers as well and assign profitability metrics for the different groupings. It really helps to have the data structured in a way that allows analysts to ask these questions and retrieve them easily. So the data discovery process will be helped or hindered a lot by the maturity of the bank's data warehouse as well as the tools used for data analysis.
