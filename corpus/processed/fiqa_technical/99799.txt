"As I said, I try to eat local. Instead of going to applebees I'll hit the diner or hole in the wall burrito joint. Twice the food for half the price, and it's orders of magnitude better, both in terms of freshness and flavor. It also supports friends/neighbors/local economy. There are a number of local establishments that get my business over big box / national chains. I don't think the ""applebees"" food type is below millenials experience-wise, I actually think it's not up to their standards from health expecations, tbh - maybe I'm missing what you're saying though. Millenials in general have been raised to have higher food standards and expectations (the entitlement gen?) where quality and health matter. At least, that's how it is in my neck of the woods. A CiCi's pizza opened up a few years ago, and we visited often. Pizza was eh, but all you can eat for 6 bucks? Sure, why not. A Saladworks opened next door around the same time. Guess which one is still there.. hint - it's not the pizza, despite it being more product for a lower price than literally anything at the salad place."
