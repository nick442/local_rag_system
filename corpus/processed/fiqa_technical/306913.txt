"Not insulting your part of Scotland, but that is exactly what happened in Detroit and the surrounding area. It used to be one of the richest (IIRC *the* richest) metro area in the US. Now look at it. Those who say the unions had nothing to do with it just have to look at what is happening. The US has states called ""Right to work"" states, this is where union membership is not mandatory. Caterpillar is based in Illinois, but just moved a factory from Japan back to the US. Illinois wasnt even in the running for it. They were all southern states that are right to work. You also have to look where foreign manufacturers build things. Toyota, Honda, VW, BMW, Mitsubishi, etc., etc., all manufacture in Southern ""right to work"" states. They still have unions, but they have less power because a lot of people chose not to be in them and pay the dues. In my opinion, the people working at the new CAT factory are probably happy the plant moved from Japan to their town. Also, all of the people working at all of those plants are glad to have their jobs instead of being unemployed. I see these massive union protections Northern states and European countries have as a negative. I think the fact manufacturers almost exclusively choose ""right to work"" states for new factories only reinforces this."
