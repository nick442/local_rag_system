Pensions should be held in an arms length trust independent trust and the company should have no access to it. All workers should be paid before executives or creditors see dime one. This is why unions need to get their shit together and break these laws for the rich, by the rich. When one of these execs walks away with millions of worker's earnings in their pockets, protest at their house, protest at the next company he works at so companies will avoid hiring them. If you let them steal your lunch money without a black eye you'll starve.
