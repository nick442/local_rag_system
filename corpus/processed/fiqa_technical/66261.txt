the spite machine thinks capitalism determines the best price for society or whatever people think society should be. People seem to be confused, without regulatory authority, if there's an extra dollar to be made, capitalism will go for it. The same can be said of things such as letting 1000 people die or getting tax breaks. If they're economically equivelent choices, capitalism will just flip a coin.
