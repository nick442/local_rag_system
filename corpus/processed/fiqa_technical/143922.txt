I would like to avoid this, so what I'm thinking about is to open a bank account abroad, and use Transferwise to transfer my HUF to that account. Do you think this makes sense? It does make sense. The challange is to find a Bank that will allow you to open an account online. Are there any more effective way to save money? Try prepaid cards. You should be able to get these from normal Banks in Hungary or other reputed financial institutions. You will have a visibility of the rates and it would be one time conversion.
