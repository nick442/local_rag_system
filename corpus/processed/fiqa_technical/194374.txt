Understood. There's no way to tell what enhancements will be available or what they'll cost, though. They will probably be too much for almost all of the world's population. They could be widely available to the middle class, but what if only the 1% can afford them, and they offer significant enhancements? Look how much power and money the 1% have now; imagine that they're also enhanced such that nobody in the 99% can keep up?
