"They will show up ad they will be given the money when the time comes. The central message out there right now is still ""don't buy a house"" especially while the smart money investors are still buying. Messaging will change when the time comes. Wait til housing prices are soaring and the media is completely in the tank with it. Yeah I know it sounds crazy but when banks want to sell loans, they will market aggressively and people will buy. Just like last time."
