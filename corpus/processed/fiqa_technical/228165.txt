"Never forget there are two kinds of people. Those who believe what they say, and those who do not believe what they say in public. For example, if my assignment were to prop up the role of the USD as world reserve currency, it would be silly of me not to be fully informed as to any possible threats to it. However, what I say in public would be designed to maintain the role of the USD (assuming that's my mission), not to actually inform others about everything I know (unless it furthers my assignment in some way). When Hillary says that the Egyptian government is ""stable"" - it's not that she actually believes it's stable, but that her role is to prop up a regime that has close ties to the American military. Calling a faltering regime ""stable"" is merely an attempt to discourage any movements trying to bring it down."
