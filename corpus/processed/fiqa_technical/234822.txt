Millionaires, by definition of being millionaires (having a million dollars), save more money than the poor. That means more of the unemployment check will go to savings rather than being spent in the economy. Which means that it will not stimulate the economy as much if given to a millionaire. The whole point of unemployment is that it gets spent into the economy immediately, and that is why it is one of the most effective forms of stimulus. The money would not be spent on the economy immediately if it were given to a millionaire. >You want to withhold unemployment insurance from rich people because you don't think they are worthy. Tell me where I said that.
