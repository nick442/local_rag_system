Yes, but the size and extent of a crime is very important in deciding what to do about it, whether or not it warrants taking resources from other crimes to fight it, or how to legislate or protect against it. Presenting incorrect data makes it difficult to allocate resources in law enforcement for the best outcomes for society. Getting caught lying about relevant data makes those catching you less likely to take you seriously. Never cry wolf, after all.
