You won't get a meaningful answer on #1, partially because it's politically charged, and partially because there are too many unknowns. To begin with, the policy itself is not fleshed out. Even if it were, its impact would be open to debate. Lowering the corporate tax rate will be accompanied by closing certain loopholes, more companies paying US tax instead of shifting income abroad, and it will also impact the level of economic growth. Each of those assumptions will have a massive impact on the ultimate effect on the debt.
