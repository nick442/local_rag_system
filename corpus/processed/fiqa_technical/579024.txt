That's the big debate. Whether or not there is an employment crisis. I don't believe there will be an Armageddon as so many are claiming. The question you're asking is the same question that's been asked for 100s of years. What happens when these jobs are gone? What happens when the majority of society is agrarian and we invent the tractor with GPS? The comparisons to previous technological advancements ARE valid. They DID replace humans. The US economy was largely agricultural. 50%+. These people were REPLACED and now only 1% of jobs are agricultural. These was no economic melt down. People said the same thing about the computer - we've lived with computers for over 40 years. Here's the thing - when you are able to produce things more efficiently, their prices go down. That opens up room for other spending in people's lives. Did you know that in the 1900s, food was 45% of the household budget? Now it is around 15%.
