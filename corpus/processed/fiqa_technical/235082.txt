"Profitability is not magical. It's not a mystical thing that requires a 4 or 8 year degree in business to understand. Twitter will never make money. You cannot make money with Social Media. All of the steps necessary to make social media profitable are the same steps which will drive your users to other platforms that remain free. Twitter is already losing users to a new software called ""Mastodon"" which is not controlled by any single corporation, it's open source and anyone can operate their own federated server. It allows much larger 'posts' which enables people to have actual, valuable conversations on it, instead of brain-vomiting. Twitter's largest mistake is probably their reluctance to abandon the 140 character limit 3 or 4 years ago when they should have. But it's too late now. It would take a miracle to save them. Social Media as a marketplace is saturated. there's 4 or 5 sites you've heard of and 5000 you haven't and they're all free. How can anyone make money in that market? You can't. And if all of the social media sites suddenly became subscription based, users would stop using them, they'd set up their own blogs using services like Wordpress.com or self-hosting them with software like WordPress.org or Ghost, and they'd use free open source software based on protocols like RSS or ATOM which have been around for a very long time to achieve the same sort of ""Friends and follower"" networks that Social Media giants want you to believe require their service. Social Media has always been a bad business model, and it will always be a bad business model. Facebook has only found success because of their puppet companies and side-projects, the social media part of their business remains unprofitable."
