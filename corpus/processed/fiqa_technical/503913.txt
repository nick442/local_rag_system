> The legal system is not meant to reward people for being screwed over **but to restore people to their rightful position** and to punish wrongdoers. Condition 1 (bolded) has not been met, yet the lawyers are profiting wildly despite that, hence the outrage. Coupons which cannot be redeemed without the wronged parties (the customers) giving Ticketmaster even *more* of their money do not constitute restitution or restoration to the position prior to the wrongdoing. Nothing short of cash being sent to the wronged parties is sufficient restitution in this case.
