This is one of the unfortunate flaws of democracy, a Demagogue can convince people to choose what is in the longer run bad for them. I would consider my self a democratic socialist and when I see what people vote for in some countries, like rising corporate tax to an insane amount that no companies will invest in said country (the opposite is ofc true).
