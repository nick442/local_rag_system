"I agree with this argument. Finance, legal, and tax compliance industries are bogus and add dubious value at best. The creation of more wealth helps those that created the wealth the most, but it oftentimes also does help everyone else as well (think: Steve Jobs & his company's many creations). But I also believe that if you had a ""full equalizer day"" and redistributed all the wealth in the US so that each of us had the same amount of money (we'd each roughly have $255,000 if my math is correct), then within 1 generation you'd already see a similar wealth distribution to what we have now. Most would consume more- rather than invest- and it would only be a temporary fix. It's a rarity to find people advocating for changing the system that creates inequality (the Fed currently being the biggest perp) instead of simply trying to redistribute the results of that system."
