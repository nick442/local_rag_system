"Yesterday I was reading in the travel StackExchange about an Indian guy who was about to hand his passport over to his Employer in Africa. His problem was that he had taken an unauthorized trip back to India against orders, but still - he was about to hand over his passport to his foreign employer. And he had nothing on his mind other than how to please his employer to keep his job. This is the reality for a lot of people. They either don't have leverage, or don't know what leverage they do have. I'm a programmer, and I know because I've been told - reading, engaging in the community, and gaining real experience. Remember that other people can be younger, less skilled, more naive, more easily intimidated, and it doesn't make them stupid or worse people. Why would anyone let their employer stick a chip in their body? Because they don't know any better. Because the employer is an authority, or they want the job, or the are scared of the consequences if they don't. Posting that it's a bad idea is a good step to helping people. They can google ""Should I let my Employer Stick A Microchip Into My Body?"" and find this. Call out Three Square Market, and their stupid idea."
