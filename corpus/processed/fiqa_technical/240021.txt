You're conflating the amount of money the American economy makes with the amount of debt the American *government* accrues. The deficit is not 2.3% of tax receipts. Really, your story is about somebody who makes $29,000, has their parent's co-signed on a mortgage for $170,000, and spent $38,000 last year. They just put the extra $9 on their parents' credit card and ignored all the times their parents have tried to sit down and talk about their spending habits over the years. The total *American* debt is $60 trillion, which is 350% of GDP.
