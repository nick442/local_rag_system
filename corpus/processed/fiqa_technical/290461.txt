> Microsoft has done a great job with their cloud platforms, revamping the microsoft office suite to compete with google's, their entire surface line of laptops and tablets, purchasing linkedin, etc. I don't understand the economics of the cloud platforms. I've heard some people say there could be an excess capacity problem like there was 20 years ago with fiber. Is that possible?
