I agree, I buy 90% of my stuff on Amazon, but still find reasons to need to go to Home Depot. Pretty much Home Depot and the grocery store are the only two places I shop besides Amazon. I've tried finding what I need on Amazon instead of going to HD but with some things you just can't. I go to HD a lot with an idea of something I want to create but not knowing exactly what I need to buy. Amazon can't replace that experience..yet.
