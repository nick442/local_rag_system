See that's where you're wrong. It's NOT a traditional game of musical chairs. It's musical chairs where anyone with the right idea and ambition can build their own chair and take a seat! The pie is NOT fixed. That's what's so great about free market capitalism. But with that comes responsibility for your own life, which apparently, and unfortunately, has turned out to be overly difficult for an increasing portion of the population.
