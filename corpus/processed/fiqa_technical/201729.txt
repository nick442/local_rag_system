I am actively against uber and would love to send some info to other people as well but that list is ridiculous. One of the items near the top is the fact that the service tracks your pickup and drop-off location. That will make 99% of every day people stop reading immediately. That is the entire point of the service. There are hundreds of other real reasons to not use them. Stallman is great but this article is no good for the vast majority of uber users.
