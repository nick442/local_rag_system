But Uncle Sam isn't just borrowing money from other people/countires. He's borrowing money from himself... with printed money. The ostensible purpose of QE, Operation Twist, et al, is to force interest rates down largely through the monetization of government debt. So to reference interest rates as if they were some neutral barometer of America's financial strength is a bit spurious.
