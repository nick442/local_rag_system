I remember walking into Sears with every intention of buying an expensive TV. I waited for 15 minutes for an employee to notice me and come help. Nothin'. I kept catching their eye and giving the eyebrows-raised, hey-can-you-help-me smile. Nothin'. I ended up walking out and going to London Drugs, of all places, where the staff was super helpful.
