"Talk about some serious hardcore overreaction. I merely made a comment on how Uganda should want to be more like Spain, not less. You argued with me. Then I cited development status. That was obviously what I meant. You're spewing nonsense. >coming in here to discuss how a third world country is generally less well off than a member of the EU and a first world country and you're going to quote the HDI. In other news the sky is blue, water is wet, the snosberries taste like snosberries and you're wasting my time and yours. Wait, I didn't want to ""discuss"" it. I made a comment with an obvious meaning, **you challenged it**, so I had to bring in facts. Now you're going completely mental on me and deleting all your comments. Not sure what kind of strategy that is, but have fun. PS: I have no idea what ""flame baiting"" is supposed to be, but that is not the first bizarre accusation you're making here, so I'll ignore it."
