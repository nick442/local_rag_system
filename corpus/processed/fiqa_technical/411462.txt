It's so wonderful. Through the magic of fractional reserve banking, a bank the vast majority of the time is loaning out money they created from thin air. And if you don't pay the obligation, they get a yacht, personal jet, or racehorse in return! Now, of course having to repossess something might be undesirable in an accounting context, but it still beggars belief that basically the entire economy and money supply of the developed world is based on obligations backed by nothing, by private parties, created out of thin air.
