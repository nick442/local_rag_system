"A pyramid scheme is a form of fraud. If someone came up to you and said: ""If you give me $100 then get two of your friends to give you $100 each, you'll make $100."" it would not be fraudulent but it also wouldn't be very successful. If that same person said ""I have a great investment that will return 100% but I need you to help by getting your friends to chip in."" they might be more successful but, given there's no actual investment, they would be lying. Multi-level marketing is notionally selling products through a pyramid-type arrangement. It is not hard to see that 1) if the product is good, this is typically a silly way to do business and 2) one could use such an arrangement as a thinly disguised ponzi scheme. Hence, MLMs, while usually legal (unless the ""product"" is clearly misrepresented), are often a vehicle for bad actors to part fools from their money."
