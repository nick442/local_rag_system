I completely agree that there are experts that recognize it as a very serious problem, and I agree that it is a serious problem that could cause a large recession or crash (my large chunk of remaining loans definitely agrees). My point is that this article isn't looking at economic data. It's looking at a survey of recent college grads and asking them to rank the risk of student loan debt vs the risk of North Korea. I wouldn't consider that a very useful indicator.
