I'm sure Nintendo made that statement to stem what will clearly be an upset during the next quarterly report. This statement was simply a reminder to investors to avoid the stick price climbing ever higher only to crash when the financial situation of the company isn't significantly different from the prior quarter. This is just spelling out the reality of Nintendo's involvement with the Pokemon brand and Pokemon Go game and the fact that the games release and associated income was already included in the guidance released last quarter. Nintendo's stock has just about doubled and there likely won't be associated income to support that come the quarterly report.
