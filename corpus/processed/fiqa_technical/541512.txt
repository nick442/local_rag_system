"From the article, hueypriest says >You canâ€™t have democracy if people can rig the ballot box. You don't get rid of elections in that situation! You ban the people who are ballot stuffing (not rigging)! I can think of many other ways to punish people/sites who are trying to cheat. IIRC, you already can't submit more than a certain number of links in a certain time-frame. I wouldn't want to limit the number of times someone can submit per day, but how difficult would it be (I really don't know) to check out the top 100 submitters to see if they are ""real"" people? That they're not submitting the majority of their links from the same sources? Instead of banning quality sites like The Atlantic and Business Week, I'd much rather see a DEFINED time period in which only x-number of links to their sites can be made per day. Or even per hour. <-- might make more sense so that not only articles from early in the day show up. I strongly support efforts being made to make sure reddit doesn't become Digg, but I don't think this is it."
