"> It should go without saying (should being the key word) that you must pay employees enough so that they stop thinking about money. I agree with that. At my retail job I would often think, ""I don't get paid enough to do that, so I'm not going to."" Now I'm in a tech job and money isn't even a thought. I just do my work."
