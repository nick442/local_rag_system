The answer is in [this graph](http://www-tc.pbs.org/prod-media/newshour/photos/2012/12/06/Andrew_Smithers_chart_blog_main_horizontal.JPG). Compare inflations rates to that graph as far back as it goes and the correspondence is better than the Phillips curve or NAIRU can provide as an explanation. Of course historically increasing employment drove up the labor return ratio more than it does today making it an indirect indicator, just not a cause in itself. Labor returns, as a ratio, are now at an all time historic low.
