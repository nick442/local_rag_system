It's so short sighted. It is a yuuuggge, gift-wrapped present for China. Now, China will step into the leadership role that the US just ceded. With that role comes huge economic opportunities as well as massive political points at home with their own people (who are the real drivers behind China's desire to reduce emissions). You can deny climate change exists, but the market has spoken folks. Green energy will be transformative to the economy. Thus, Trump's push to hold onto last century's technology, energy and jobs is a bad move and one that will ultimately cost all of us. Meanwhile, China will push further and further ahead in that space and benefit from the economic gains that come with being the defacto leader in the climate change fight.
