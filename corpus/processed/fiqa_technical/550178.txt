I think it will work out ok in seattle, but here's the thing.. A policy that works ok in a quickly growing city won't necessarily work well in another economic environment. Think rural town or even a slowly growing city. So really it doesnt tell us shit. Other than maybe the fact that we could use economic data to help us target better minimum wages at a local level. Thats too complicated though for anyone to care about imo.
