big banks are not the only Big Money out there. In fact, big banks have way more oversight than most other businesses. Everyone uses banks for most things. It's kind of hard NOT to these days. But banks are built to handle money. That's what they do! Of COURSE banks are almost always involved in everything that requires money. I don't understand why you brought this up at all. It doesn't really support your point, and has little to do with my point.
