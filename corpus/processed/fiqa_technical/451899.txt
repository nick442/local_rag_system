Leave your money at home? I don't carry cash therefore if I make a purchase I make it on plastic and have to explain myself to my spouse. It isn't that either of us is particularly brutal about it, but we have agreed that neither of us wants to waste money we don't have. The downside to my plan is that the guilt comes later, after the damage is done.
