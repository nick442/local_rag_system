"No, it's not fair usage at all. Maybe meets a legal definition of fair usage, but it's not what we'd consider a ""straight faced"" claim. Any amount of chicken added to a recipe is ""100%"" chicken. A molecule of chicken in a recipe qualifies it to include ""100% chicken."" It's tautological. It's designed to make you believe the product is more wholesome or free of additives than it actually is. It's a psychological scam, like pretty much all packaging and marketing."
