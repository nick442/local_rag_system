It depends. If you’re a lowly peon, bankrupting is bad because you deprive the hard-working bourgeois who have worked very hard to give you some debt, and by not repaying your debt to them, you are punishing their business success and depriving them of their rightfully owned interest (and principal). And this is not moral at all, as this is highly frowned upon by the lord Jesus Christ himself. However, if you’re a big croporation, bankrupcy is good because it enables you to restructure your financial environment to insure a better efficiency in maximizing the debt-to-equity ratio of your stakeholders without tying them up with excessive liability that would be detrimental to their cash flow positivity.
