If you're talking about the guy I worked for then you're fucking stupid. This guy started off by going door to door and b2b and started his marketing business from scratch, after a couple of other endeavours. If you think this guy earned his bills from his daddy like trump then your nothing but an ignorant fuck by definition. I have more respect for this guy then most people on this planet. If I hadn't had some personal issues I'd still be working for him.
