According to the Credit Union National Association (NCUA), in recent years there has been a noticeable trend of credit unions lending money to credit union members for business. Some of these credit unions have already lent billions in business loans. The size of an average loan of this type is approximately $200,000. It appears that this trend will continue since credit unions seem willing to lend more. In some cases credit unions have even gone as far as creating new divisions specifically to work with small business owners.
