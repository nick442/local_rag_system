I'm confused. Were those among the emails Don Jr provided freely and openly to the public, or were those among the 33000 emails that Clinton erased with no DOJ review? Or was that email data contained within the phones and computers Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Awan, and Clintons staff smashed with hammers before they could go through DOJ review? Its awfully difficult to keep all these emails straight y'know. Could you lend me a hand by telling me where the emails you speak of came from?
