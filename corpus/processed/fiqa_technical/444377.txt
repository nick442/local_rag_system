I don't have as strong of feelings as others here do. I actually like tipping in restaurants. Servers get paid more than they would getting a higher flat wage, at least if they do a good job and I think it does encourage better service. I do however dislike when people try to get tips out of every profession and especially something like this where people are and were already making pretty solid money(at least in my area they do) and now because a competitor offers it I should start tipping. I'd rather Uber decided to give a larger share of the profits to their drivers or even to very slightly up the prices. Fact of the matter is there isn't really much of a difference between Uber drivers in my experience. With the rare big fuck up driving or terrible attitude, most people are fine and driving someone from point a to point b doesn't leave a lot of room to provide exceptional service worthy of a tip. Very much unlike being a server or something.
