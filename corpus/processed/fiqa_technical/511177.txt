"I never said Wall Street enjoys paying taxes. But that is only because they are short-sighted and arrogant. If they were to take a step back they would see that a functioning society is more in their interest that a few extra mil and social upheaval. If this is a reasonable argument (not saying it's true, but that it's not immediately or definitively wrong), then we can say that it's not unreasonable for Warren Buffet to hold that idea, which would invalidate your premise. Requiring a level of proof beyond that is absurd and you're just obstructing the conversation, what are we going to do, hack into his brain to find out his ""true"" thoughts? Just to be clear, I do not think government bureaucracy will solve this problem, and I agree with your analysis of how that would play out. I don't think a solution to these types of problems exists within the state-market paradigm. But at least now we're agreeing that there is a market-failure at work, rather than your previous statement of ""it is ridiculous for Bob to think he is entitled to 5 cows if John sells Jim ten thousand heads."" My question then is why do you espouse such simplistic nonsense when you understand that the situation is much more complex? Is it because it is easier and more psychologically comfortable to ignore these injustices than to admit that your model does not have an effective way of dealing with them? > Why do you think this, exactly? Because things like this require collective action or you run into the free rider problem."
