"Wouldn't be advisable, it's not a bank account. However, some plans have emergency ""hardship"" provisions. Some that I'm familiar with would only be allowable if you are ineligible for a loan. Some of the reasons are purchase of a primary residence, college expenses, funeral costs, or to prevent eviction. Hope this helps."
