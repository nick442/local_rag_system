Someone really needs to shake up the car rental industry the way Uber shook the f*ck up out off the taxi industry. Just cut out the middle men. No need to deal with any employees; just Open your phone in a huge parking lot of nice cars at the airport and choose the car that you want to drive yourself for the next few days. Just walk up to the car and open it with the app. And you're off.
