I'm very aware of what a non-profit is. I understand there is money to be made as an employee of a non-profit. What I would like to do is make money as the owner of the company. I would also like the possibility of stock options in the future. My partner's ideal path would be to establish a non-governmental organization and I see it as a loss of income opportunity. What I can tell you about this business is that it is a website. A social media platform. The possible revenue from ads would never happen for a NPO.
