"Accretive means additive. When someone says ""accretive to EPS"" it means that it should theoretically add to EPS. The problem is that the models they're using to determine pro forma EPS are filled with bullshit assumptions that may or may not reflect reality. I remember working on merger models as a young analyst and having my MD tell me on multiple occasions ""those accretion numbers aren't good enough, play with the assumptions"""
