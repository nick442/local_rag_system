A) Wrong subreddit. There's probably a legal advice Canada one you should check out. B) You're a cashier. No one cares about your involvement in taxing products/customers. Unless you're directly pocketing money the most you could be is out of a job. C) If you're part of a chain store there is a REALLY good chance they have their inventory/sales numbers looked at regularly by extremely qualified people. Conclusion: Customer was being a dick for no reason.
