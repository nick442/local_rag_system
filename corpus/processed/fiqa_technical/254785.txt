"Well, you mentioned McKinsey earlier and that's a consulting firm. All of them draft from the Ivy's (plus the other top tiers) but it also helps to come from a school that is well known but not an Ivy. (NYU comes to mind) My friends from CUNY Honors Baruch got jobs in accounting pretty easily as CUNY Baruch has programs set up with different companies and a fairly established network in the accounting field. It's pretty good if all you want to do is accounting. In my experience, there's less of a ""prestige"" focus with IB's and accounting firms. The top consulting firms, on the other hand, are quite ""prestige"" focused. (worked in one that hired 80-90% from top tiered schools) It's hard to put an umbrella statement over everything because there are exceptions. And, networking can trump everything. You should be less concerned about schools and more about grades. A brand name won't help if you have an average GPA. To that point, take a major you'd do well at. Statistics, computer science, mathematical engineering are in demand but your major won't help if the work is too difficult/uninteresting leading to lower grades."
