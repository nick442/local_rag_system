Just remember, the biggest difference between a science advocate and a science denier is the ability to separate emotion (aka bias) from an objective assessment of reality.

Can you imagine journal articles filled with this preposterous nonsense? Of course not. Thats been how stupid your side of this argument has been. Soak it in.
