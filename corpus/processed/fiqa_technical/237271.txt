How is everyone doing in their day to day lives? What is affordable and what is not? Often I find myself reading news that I find is disconnected from my reality. Unemployment numbers are good. I am employed, yet I can't help the feeling that many are getting the squeeze, especially amongst my peers; the new reality of employment being less livable than previously. Perhaps too much zerohedge? Housing is expensive, saving for retirement seems futile? Stocks are seemingly very expensive?
