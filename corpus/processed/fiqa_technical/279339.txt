Yes, but how does that compare to those with multiple houses? I build homes in the Seattle area for a living and one lifestyle who own several rentals.. One thing them do is use equity for their 4 homes to purchase another. Writing off the the interest paid on the loan(s).. I'm not saying it's a deduction normal people don't use.. I'm just saying that it strikes me as a deduction that the wealthiest landlords use more with better results..
