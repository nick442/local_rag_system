I'm a database guy who got his education in economics. Economists use non-cooperative behavior to model short term, individual benefit chasing behavior by actors. People are selfish. *shrug* You can make life a lot shittier for everyone if you opperate on the assumption that they can be made better. Hundreds of millions of people have already been killed in that pursuit. Capitalism works because it monetizes and rewards contribution. The greater the value your contribution has, the more reward you get, generally speaking.
