You must not be from around these parts. AT&T & Verizon have really done an excellent job at nothing. I mange 25 lines for the company I work at. having that many lines, I see some fun things. We have at times been with both AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile. Of the 3 only T-Mobile has the honor of more than 3 consecutive months without a billing error. Infact our 2 years with T-Mobile, there was only 3 billing errors. AT&T had errors monthly, Verizon was as bad. Signal, of course varies from one local to another, but here all 3 suck the hind tit. I have nothing from my experience with AT&T and Verizon that I could say positively about the quality of the service.
