"Get fucked with that idiocy mate. You can cut the data seven ways to Sunday. >""Americans absolutely confirm they believe America is the land of opportunity and that people should have equal opportunity if they have the skills,"" said Diana Elliott, research officer for the Pew Charitable Trusts’ Economic Mobility Project, in an interview. ""The data fly in the face of what Americans have believed and what they say they believe in our polling work."" >Pew found that economic mobility is largely an accident of birth. Currier points to the fact that 66 percent of people born in the lowest two income levels remain there as adults, and exactly 66 percent of people born at the highest two income levels stay there as adults, a phenomenon called ""stickiness at the ends."" http://www.pewtrusts.org/~/media/legacy/uploadedfiles/pcs_assets/2012/pursuingamericandreampdf.pdf >In particular, previous analyses of economic mobility in the United States and other industrialized nations reveal that the United States has less, not more, mobility than its northern neighbor. That is, one's family economic background is more likely to influence one's economic outcomes in the United States than in Canada. http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/reports/0001/01/01/chasing-the-same-dream-climbing-different-ladders >One way to think of the estimated elasticity of children’s income with respect to their parents’ is to ask how much of a given income advantage observed in the parental generation is preserved in the children’s generation. Miles Corak exem- plifies this for the difference observed in the United States for families with children under the age of 18.15 The top fifth of such families have about 12 times as much income as the bottom fifth. If the intergenerational persistence of income was equal to one, that income advantage would be transferred in whole to the next generation. That is, the children of the richest fifth would have 12 times as much income as the children of the poorest fifth. If the intergenerational persis- tence of income were equal to zero, none of that advantage would be present among the children of these groups. Corak reported that U.S. estimates of the elasticity vary in the range of 0.4–0.6, corresponding to an inherited income advantage of between 2.70 and 4.44 for the richest fifth compared to the poorest fifth. Elasticity at these levels means that the children whose parents were among the richest fifth (i.e., parents whose income was 12 times that of the poorest fifth) grow up to earn about 3 to 4 times as much as the children whose parents were among the poorest fifth. Thus, their income advantage was roughly half that of their parents. http://www.irp.wisc.edu/publications/focus/pdfs/foc262g.pdf All you logic 100 students can go Fuck a duck with your idiocy"
