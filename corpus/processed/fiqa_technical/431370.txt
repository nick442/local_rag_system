From a moral perspective, this would be so great. From a marketing perspective, all it would take is to 'leak' more videos that show how industrial meat production actually looks like to turn a large number of consumers to something that's ethically better (and probably can also be argued to be healthier). Excited to see this, less from an investment perspective, but because this could really change how humans interact with animals in a significant way.
