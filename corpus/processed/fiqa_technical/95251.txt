Just to clarify my statement. I don't believe they would use UPS for the whole trip. It is likely that they get enough orders at any one time from the US to be able to fill a container and ship to a UPS hub in the US. From there UPS takes over distribution to individual customers. (Source, one large account I worked on had a similar arrangement. We handled getting the containers of stuff to Sweden and then distribution companies like DHL took over and distributed to individual stores etc.)
