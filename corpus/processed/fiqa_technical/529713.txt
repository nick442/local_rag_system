That's a double edged sword though. You can't just allow an economy to rely on that forever. At some point the U.S. has to stand on it's own feet. The fed can't support an entire economy indefinitely. They've already started taping, for good reason. Plus, you don't really know how bad inflation is when it's being masked by QE.
