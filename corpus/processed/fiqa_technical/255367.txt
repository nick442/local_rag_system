Is this RRSP through your company? If not, then you should be able to transfer the assets from GWL to CIBC using an RRSP transfer authorization form initiated through CIBC. Once your SD RSP account is set up at CIBC, use their transfer form. There is also a universal form T2033 if CIBC doesn't have one themselves. Beware of transfer out fees at GWL.
