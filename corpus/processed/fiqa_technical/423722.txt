If it's easier for you to believe that I'm lying and keep waiting for that *lucky* break, good *luck* with that. A 90 hour a week schedule is hard but not impossible. It was the hardest two years of my life, and that's counting the first two years of parenthood I'm getting though. Had a baby on the way for one of them which may have provided me with more motivation than your average slacker college kid, but I was already a year into my insane schedule before my wife got pregnant.
