> Don't you think the fact that most of the world's wealth is concentrated in that top 1% has something to do with that? Poor people have far, far more children than the rich. Rich people have on average 1.5 children. Some countries in Africa average 7-10 children per woman. There's absolutely no way to not end up with crippling poverty and inequality with breeding habits like that.
