The point of unemployment insurance *from a governmental spending perspective* is as stimulus. The government is interested in keeping society working properly for as many people as possible, it is not concerned with giving *you* money between *your* jobs. Unemployment insurance helps make sure that recessions do not turn into depressions, because the economy won't grind to a halt as soon as people get fired.
