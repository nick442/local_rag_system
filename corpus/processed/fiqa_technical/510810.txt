Ok so apple doesn't store money over seas because we now have a no loophole 25% tax. You're so smart, this benefits anyone how? Now they're magically going to build factories because they pay the exact same in taxes it's just not over seas? They're going to pay more to their employees? How much did intel pull in 15b? What are they going to do now that they save a few billion or pay the same? Sorry but if you don't do anything now you won't later on.
