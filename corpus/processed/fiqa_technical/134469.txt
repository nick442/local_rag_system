You can't blame businessmen for wanting to run their operations more efficiently. As much as I dislike overseas call centers, and severely question their trade-off (low cost for low quality) - the cost benefits can save a business from going under; e.g. 100 man call center possible over there, 100 man call center locally not possible due to costs. In many cases, the business is forced to use the less expensive option, both by necessity and common business sense. I'm not going to run the numbers, but after you add all the taxes and regulatory requirements; the difference is significant. As for president; I dislike all career politicians, but would prefer someone with extensive business experience if I had to make a choice. From a business stand point, was Romney successful with investing his money? It certainly seems so; now contrast that with Obama's own equity record of investing taxpayer money, and then check out all that red.. ..and indictments ..and bare benefit. Seems pretty obvious to me who has the worse record here.
