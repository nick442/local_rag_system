Work for a bank (ultra high net worth individuals). We will do advised lines of credit (we have to approve every draw) secured by a portfolio of art. Slightly better pricing than if it were unsecured, but we will do higher loan amounts. I haven't done wine-secured, but have seen guys with $1mm+ wine collections on their balance sheets.
