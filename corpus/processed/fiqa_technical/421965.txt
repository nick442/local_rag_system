probably forgetting some but off the top of my head:MIT, Caltech, Berkeley, UCLA, Duke, Stanford, Chicago, NYU, Northwestern, Michigan, Notre Dame, UVA, and top LACs like Amherst,Williams,etc. At a target school you would see many of the following names come to your school for OCR or resume drops: Goldman Sachs, KKR, Blackstone, Morgan Stanley, JPM, D.E. Shaw, Jane Street, Blackrock, Two Sigma, Citadel
