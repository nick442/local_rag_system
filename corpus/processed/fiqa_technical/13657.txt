In short: yes, as long as you have Internet access. See, for example this question or this one about opening a brokerage account from outside the US. Your sister could even open an account here in the US and provide you with access. However, I'm guessing you're not a registered or even formally trained financial advisor and if you make bets with her money that don't work out well, she could get pretty upset with you. You might consider doing research from Bangladesh on good financial advisors and picking one (or a few) to recommend she go see in the US. EDIT: OP hopes to be a financial advisor in the future. Given that comment, I'd recommend looking into becoming a Certified Financial Planner (unless CFA suits your goals; you indicated that process is already underway), as a step towards that goal. Information about the certification in the US is here, in India here, and in some other countries here.
