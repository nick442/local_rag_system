"You're perfectly correct, but it's kind of weird to me. I *kind of* get the point behind the result of the USADA ruling, which would presumably be that ""if you cheated at one sport, you'll cheat at another"", but it's just a little strange that just because you doped as a cycler, you can't run a marathon or try to join the Pro Bowlers' Association."
