"Home Depot, Lowe's and Best Buy are all ""big box"" stores which sell appliances. One can also buy appliances at smaller stores like Ace Hardware or True Value. Sears and HH Gregg are not the only places to buy appliances. Wal Mart even sells smaller appliances. I wouldn't be surprised if selling large appliances were their next move in retail."
