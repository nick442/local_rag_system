"The atavism that you suggest is ludicrous on its face for, among other reasons, it only applied to cuisine: ""Athenaeus, writing in the third century CE, mentions that in 500 BC, in the Greek city of Sybaris (located in what is now southern Italy), there were annual culinary competitions. The victor was given the exclusive right to prepare his dish for one year."" *See* M. Frumkin, ""The Origin of Patents"", Journal of the Patent Office Society, March 1945, Vol. XXVII, No. 3, pp 143 et seq."
