"You're welcome to hold any opinion of my writing as you like, but after actually typing my name ""Amy Hoy"" you still refer to me as a ""he""? Amy is a girl's name and my picture is obviously of a woman. The culture I'm complaining about is everywhere, not just in b-school. Look at Hacker News, TechCrunch, or any kind of startup event. Or the VCs who got together to lament ""dipshit companies"" as anyone who doesn't swing for the fences: *The VCs, for their part, fight back more quietly. They point out that very few angel funded startups end up very big or interesting. “An entire generation of entrepreneurs are building dipshit companies and hoping that they sell to Google for $25 million,” lamented a venture capitalist to me recently. He believes that angel investors are pushing entrepreneurs to think small, and avoid the home run swings. And you don’t get a home run unless you swing hard, he says. When you play it safe you nearly always lose.* http://techcrunch.com/2010/08/15/venture-capital-super-angel-war-entrepreneur/ If you (anyone, not OP) don't think this attitude is rife, you're not paying attention."
