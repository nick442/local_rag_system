He gets upset if I insist on bringing an extra person to help him out but then he complains about his work load and how he's running the company alone. Why complain if I offered him an assistant? I wish my boss would've offered me an assistant when I worked at companies. He refuses to take paid vacations. If he does take a vacation he'll tell me 2 to 3 weeks in advance. My red flag is he never ever takes a paid vacation. If he does take a paid vacation he plans it out a few weeks in advance. This is the perfect way to cover up anything.
