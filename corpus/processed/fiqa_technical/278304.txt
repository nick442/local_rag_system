tv advertising is getting cheaper and helps you building massive brand equity in a short time, which is the main reason why ATL advertising actually works even better for online brands.. plus, as someone as already pointed out, they're trying to get themselves known to a segment which necessarily does not know them yet. btw, some insurance companies are moving they're budget away from ppc to tv. Since the huge increase in average cost per click for insurance related keywords, due to high competition, the cpc of a visitor coming from tv (saw advert on tv, typed url or accessed to the website through brand seo keyword) is actually cheaper than running ppc campaigns aimed to acquire new users. probably this is not the case for fab, however there's a still a lot to learn and improve in terms of media plans, considering on and offline media.
