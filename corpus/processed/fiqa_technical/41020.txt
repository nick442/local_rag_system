You don't understand how global warming works and where most emissions sources come from (hint: transportation is a huge one). Never mind local air quality. Neither of these things mean we must live devoid of petroleum products. Just that we don't need to burn it and live with the exhaust it creates and the consequences that arise from it. But yes, wind and solar are already becoming the cheapest forms of electricity available. The price point for renewables no longer requires heavy subsidies and is now becoming cost competitive.
