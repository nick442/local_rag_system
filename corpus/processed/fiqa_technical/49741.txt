"> would anyone have viewed the success of the iPhone differently if its launch was delayed by a few months? OK, Mr. Financial 'journalist', why don't you look up Mr/Ms ""Depositor #455,000"" and catch their reaction when they find out when they can expect their Model 3? How many tail-end Charlies are going to wait that out? Not to mention what ""tail-end"" will end up paying; the [current](http://insideevs.com/when-will-the-7500-us-credit-expire-for-the-tesla-model-3-and-everyone-else/) phase-out schedule for that $7500 tax-credit puts it to our recent 'depositor', *hard*. At the Model 3 price point, this is going to make the car about 20% less 'affordable for most of those in line. With almost 10% back-outs already, another few 'below-expectations' quarters will provoke some serious pitchfork waving."
