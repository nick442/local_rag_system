>Im suggesting if they break the law they go to jail, just like every one else Actually above you were complaining about the monetary penalties, and said nothing about criminal penalties. Which is it? Hundreds of millions of dollars is hardly light fines. As to going to jail, it depends on the law. Speeding breaks the law, yet it is not often a jailable offense. If *individuals* broke laws that result in jail time, they will likely be prosecuted and sent to jail. [The Justice Department and New York County Attorney Generalâ€™s Office, which together have handled the high-profile cases that Mazur criticized, said they will always bring criminal charges where evidence permits.](http://blogs.reuters.com/financial-regulatory-forum/2012/06/20/record-setting-bank-forfeiture-at-ing-ignites-debate-over-lack-of-banker-prosecutions/)
