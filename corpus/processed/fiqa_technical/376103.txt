In any business keeping your customers happy is one thing, turining them into advocates for you is another. On the other side of this I knew a person who happened to be the owner and CEO of a multimillion dollar business he built from the ground up. He was incredibly loyal every firm he did business with and expected to be treated with respect. As it turns out he also enjoyed working in his garden on weekends. One Saturday, while working in his garden, he realized he needed to do some banking before the bank closed. He quickly runs out to the bank to do his business and is denied service despite having all the proper ID because of the way he looked (dirty from gardening). That following Monday he went in (In his suit this time) and transferred every penny of his business and personal holdings amounting to 10s of Millions to a different firm. Treat cuastomers well and they will generate business for you, treat people poorly and you will lose customers. Lose enough and you are no longer in business.
