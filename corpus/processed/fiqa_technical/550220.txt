No. Because, while it's not meat, it's also not fake food. It's labelled Vegan and the people that buy it know what they are getting and, I believe, try it out of curiosity and because it's better for them and the environment (not sure about the last two, but curiosity for sure). It's offered as a tasty option to replace dead animal flesh. Edit: I'm sure that their product is better for people than animal flesh and better for the environment, but I'm not sure if carnist are buying for those reasons. Hopefully, that's part of their decision process.
