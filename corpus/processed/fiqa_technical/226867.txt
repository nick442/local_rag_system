Italy has some real problems including a debt it can't pay without higher taxes or new sources of revenue. Looks like they are going to force the pension funds to buy their debt. I bet more governments follow their example and grab their people's assets. I remember when the democrats controlled the congress they held committee hearings on replacing 401k savings with a federal pension program. If they had done it, then it would have been worth $3.5 trillion in new money to the politicians. The people would have gotten another ponzi scheme like social security.
