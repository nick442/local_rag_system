Money is a means to an end. If you see it as an end, of course you're not going to be happy, but so long as you utilize it to maintain a stable lifestyle which will allow for you to do things like spend quality time with loved ones, develop skills, and pursue interests (things that actually do tend to bring happiness), money is a good tool to have.
