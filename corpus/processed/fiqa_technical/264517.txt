"It is very hard to find any ""tough math"" application that isn't already packaged nicely in a library or app. Unless you're out to break grounds, you don't need to do any math beyond knowing what function to call and what button to click. After went through and understanding a bunch of the option pricing equations, I forgot 99.9% of them already. Why? Because in a day to day basis, all I needed to know is which function to call in quantlib and trust whoever wrote quantlib know what they're doing."
