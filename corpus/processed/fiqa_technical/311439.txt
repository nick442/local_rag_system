"While the techniques are well known computer science results, at least in academia they havent been exhaustively applied to everything yet. So LDA and NMF text analysis and stuff are somehow ""cutting edge"" in academic research only because not many of the older more established professors can get on board as quickly as new students with a programming background. I agree it seems weird, but in the literature these applications are ""new"" and ""hot"". source: finance phd student doing research on machine learning and text analysis."
