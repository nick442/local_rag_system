"Or doing work, that has value, but with an experienced employee looking over their shoulder for more total time than it would take said employee to just do the work him/herself. In which case they're learning something, and ""doing work that has value"", but at the cost of a similar amount of value from elsewhere. That's pretty extreme, though, and at least in a field like programming where the pros get paid quite a bit..so say it takes the pro 10hrs to do something, and it takes the intern 40hrs and 5hrs of help to do the same thing. But if the pro gets paid $80/hr, and the intern only gets paid $10..haha that works out perfectly. Even if it hadn't the point standsâ€”the intern can get paid something as long as they're doing _some_ useful work, even if it takes them an exorbitant amount of time to do it. If they actually need as much help as it would take the pro to just do it..consider another field, dude."
