"The reason Comcast (I'll just say ""Comcast"" when I mean ""TV providers like Comcast, DISH, Cox, etc."") bundle channels is because they get to sell advertising on those channels. Each channel (or group of channels, like Disney) _charges_ Comcast for the privelege of broadcasting it. That is, ABC and HBO and so forth ask Comcast for a certain $$ per year/month/fortnight, etc. Comcast then takes really popular channels -- like HBO, and ""bundles"" them up with shitty channels, like VH1 and the Oxygen Network. Comcast then sells advertising based on _those bundles_. So if you want to advertise to middle-aged white women in the mid-morning (Oxygen), you have to also pay for advertising on HBO at the same time, which drives up the price Comcast can ask. The popular channels are, essentially, loss leaders. In turn, however, Oxygen can say, ""Hey, you're making a crapton of money advertising on our channel, Comcast. Pay us more or we pull the channel!"" This cycle continues and is part of the reason cable TV prices keep going up. (Some other reasons are retardedly over-the-top greed) For your model to work, a single subscription fee would have to replace the income earned from ads _and_ maintain the same price paid to each network. Since Comcast can no longer force people to pay for Oxygen when all they want is HBO, the prices for the non-popular channels skyrocket as people stop paying for them. The shitty networks aren't willing to take the risk of cutting their revenue streams off and will most certainly write into their agreements with Comcast, ""And no streaming!"" The super-popular networks don't need the extra income and feel like streaming would diminish their brand, so they add in similar ""no streaming!"" clauses."
