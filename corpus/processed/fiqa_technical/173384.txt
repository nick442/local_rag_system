"I found google policy regarding public domain content: Content comprised predominantly of public domain material is not accepted due to its widespread duplication. Multiple versions of the same book confuse our users and provide little distinguishing value. We allow select partners to submit curated editions of public domain books to ensure their availability, but we're not offering this exemption to others at this time. They allow ""select partners"" to sell public domain books that most times are identical to the original version (usually sold for 1$). Other book versions feature notes or a critical introduction and the price goes up to 10 $ . Also, you cannot list books for free in google play. The minimum price is 1$ ."
