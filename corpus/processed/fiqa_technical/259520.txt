"I agree with you in that I think social pressures can contribute to the abandoning of STEM subjects at a young age. However, I would argue that these biases are experienced by both young men and women. I can't recall there ever being a situation where a subject was viewed as ""neerdy"" or detrimental to the social standings of female students but not male students. What I think holds more weight is the idea you last mentioned, which was the need for female students to be encouraged. Personally, I believe that the outdated chauvinistic views of older genrations is still spilling into younger genrations (in the form of parents and teachers/counselors). While the article is quite lengthy, a big portion of it discusses how male students were encouraged to ""tough out"" classes/subjects when they began to face difficulties. Whereas female students ""receive fewer arguments from their parents, teachers or guidance counselors if they drop a physics class or shrug off an AP exam""."
