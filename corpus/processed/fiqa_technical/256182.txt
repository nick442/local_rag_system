I worked in supply chain at one of Toyota's plants, and making cars is an incredibly difficult and daunting undertaking. My hat goes off to Tesla and Elon Musk. The odds are stacked against them: the big players have huge cash reserves and competing against them isn't easy. However my biggest concern is that Tesla base their very existence on the premise that electric will be *the* method of propulsion for future cars. Hydrogen isn't out of the running yet, and if it ends up becoming feasible and suddenly becomes the preferred method of clean propulsion then Tesla will be blindsided, while the big car makers can simply start a new department for such engines. They're flexible, Tesla is not.
