Couldn't have asked for a better response. As for my courses, yes I had various group projects in different classes, with my capstone finance course being entirely group project based, so that would definitely put a dent in the required hours. But still the whole thing seems a bit arbitrary doesn't it? There's no real way of keeping track of hours, then again I haven't done much research on the program yet and if it comes down to the wording I can probably make it work as it is. Regardless thanks for pointing me in the right direction, I am for sure interested in the PMP and in the mean time ill check out what you suggested. Appreciate it.
