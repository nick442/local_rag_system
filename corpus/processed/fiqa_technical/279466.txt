"There are a few things that trader Joes sells that can't be beat by any other chain: They sell fine cheeses at prices far below what I've seen at normal grocery stores. Their wine/beer selection is huge and often sold at an incredibly good price. Their liquor is good too, their white label ""Joe's"" brand liquors are usually really good and taste like double what you paid. Their produce is not great, but noy bad. Their snacks are awesome and oftentimes exclusive to trader Joes. I also think their coffee can't be beat."
