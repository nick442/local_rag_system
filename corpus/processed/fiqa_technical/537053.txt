A debenture is a security document. This means that the bond is secured over assets. Under English law, you can issue bonds which, if defaulted upon, you can enforce your security against the issuer (i.e. the company), which means you can attempt to get your money back by getting hold of the company's assets. As for a floating charge, I'll first explain what a fixed charge is. Say you're a bank (a lender) and you lend Â£1000 to X. You take security by way of a fixed charge over X's photocopy machines. X is unable to dispose of the machines without the lender's consent. This means that if X cannot pay up the loan, you can enforce security by taking possession of the photocopy machines, sell them, and hopefully get enough money back to cover the default. A floating charge works the same way but over assets which fluctuate, e.g. X's stock of potatoes. X sells potatoes to supermarkets all the time so you can't just take a fixed charge over it for practical reasons, you can't just ask the lender each time you want to sell a potato. When an event of default occurs, i.e. you don't pay back the loan or breach a condition of the loan agreement, the floating charge crystallises, and becomes a fixed charge, thus enabling the lender to sell the potatoes to get their money back.
