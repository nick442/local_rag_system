That's a nice idea, but it isn't likely to happen at any point in the near future. Reddit is a bad example as it is a collection of links to websites. I agree I'm here mainly for the comments, but they're nothing without the links to the websites that we need to be able to read first. And what of other websites that don't rely purely on comments and user submitted content? Should they try donations (which doesn't really work) or. something else? The brilliance of the internet is that it is free. Someone in southern Sahara can potentially watch a YouTube video showing how to fix a generator, or build a water generator. That is great! Sharing of information is so important. Assuming a whole new internet is off the cards, what then?
