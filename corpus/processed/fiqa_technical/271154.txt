I know everything I need to know about you. You are in favor of a tax system that doesn't apply to you. You don't think on a macro level of the inherent effects it would have on the market, people's 401k's, investments, and property values. You think short term. No thought on the viability or future health of investments. They don't apply to you, so why would you care? You care because you are a self serving narcissist that deems it acceptable to raid other people's prosperous endeavors. You have selfish interests in the guise of altruism.
