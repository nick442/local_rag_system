If you're a few decades older, your generation is mostly to blame for this reversal of fortunes in the US. 1969 was the peak of American culture. Not since 1969 have more cars been sold in the US despite a doubling in the population. The average age of a US vehicle used to be between 3-5 years now it is between 8 - 12 years old. A poorer population cannot afford a new car as often anymore. How do you expect consumes to shop at Sears and give them high profits if they don't have jobs themselves.
