Alright you seem like a pleasant guy. I'm going to continue here the conversation here if you don't mind. Referencing back to what you said about Kodak, one of my business professors was in middle management with them in the 90's. He cited the monolithic culture and adherence to chemical photo processing as the main reasons for their downfall. They refused to embrace the future DESPITE having developed digital camera technology ahead of the rest of the curve. In fact, they suppressed it, for fear of sowing the seeds of their own demise. Why Kodak has closed up shop has nothing to do with China and everything to do with themselves. The few places that still do chemical photo processing are countable and shrinking. It seems your anger is misplaced.
