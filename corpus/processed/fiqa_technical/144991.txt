"I am very skeptical of the claims that self-driving vehicles will change behaviors. I am on-board with them replacing drivers in taxi/Uber, buses and freight. I don't see them changing the convenience or ""pride of ownership"" for individuals at all. Especially in mid-sized and small cities and rural areas. We can already see this with things like city bikes. They haven't reduced the rate of ownership for bicycles at all. People want their own stuff. That won't change just because a car can drive itself."
