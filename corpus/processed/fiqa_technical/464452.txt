interesting and good points BUT, 1- the S&P e-mini has plenty of liquidity for me and all of us here at reddit. idont think that we could move/influence its price with our trades. 2- i dont have the historical of bid-ask or tick by tick, it is backtested on 1min chart, entering the trade at a close of a 1min bar and subtracting a commission/slippage of a tick or two per trade. your thoughts ?
