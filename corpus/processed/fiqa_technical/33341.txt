"It's like people think the definition of fascism is ""a thing I don't like"". Let say, as Robert Paxton did, that fascism is ""a form of political behavior marked by obsessive preoccupation with community decline, humiliation, or victimhood and by compensatory cults of unity, energy, and purity, in which a mass-based party of committed nationalist militants, working in uneasy but effective collaboration with traditional elites, abandons democratic liberties and pursues with redemptive violence and without ethical or legal restraints goals of internal cleansing and external expansion."" What does that have to do with minimum wage or a livable wage? I'm not saying you can't push for some lassiez faire paradise but everyone who disagrees with you isn't a fascist."
