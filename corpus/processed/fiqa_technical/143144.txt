"Here, a sample conversation. ""Wow, these meatballs are fantastic. What's in them?"" ""100% Beef."" ""They're all beef?"" ""No, but the beef I put in is 100% beef."" 'Uhhh, ok. How much of it is beef?"" ""I don't have to tell you."" Is that person being straight with his guest? Or is he being a coy fuckhead?"
