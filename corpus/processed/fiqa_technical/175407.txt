"Economic slavery is telling her to fight for $15/hour so she can work the same shitty jobs at the same shitty hours for the rest of her life. And even more tragically is that people are telling her she'll be better off with a higher minimum wage. If the minimum wage is $15/hour, then everything will be priced accordingly. You can't beat the market by price fixing, it has never worked in history and will never work. All those ""experiments"" of raising minimum wage will never tell the true story if they are isolated by a city, or even a state, because too much is supplied from places that won't reflect a $15/hour minimum wage. What nobody wants to say is that Fran needs to take a long hard look at why she has been in the fast food industry for 22 years and is still making minimum wage. Managers at McDonald's average $43k/Year (according to Glassdoor), which is more than most teachers make and is more than base pay for most enlisted ranks in the military (it also doesn't include their benefits)."
