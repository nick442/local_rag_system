So in a ten year history the company makes one misstep (one which makes perfect sense; it was just an error in timing) and we want to throw out all the leadership and take control? Where is this kind of uproar at investment banks that leveraged themselves out on a limb in stormy waters? Or at Microsoft that routinely pours money down product holes without marketing and advertising support? Or any of a dozen other companies that make stupid decisions driven by the ego or short-sightedness of the CEO? No, let's beat on one of the best executives on Wall Street because we're whiny about short-term losses in pursuit of long-term gains. We need more honeypots for stupid investors like Facebook - maybe if enough idiots get burned they'll just get out.
