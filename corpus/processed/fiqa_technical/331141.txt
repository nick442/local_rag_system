As an attorney, your proposal would result in fewer attorneys taking on class action cases. Typically in class action lawsuits, the consumer is unable to afford to pay the attorneys their hourly rate. So the attorney gets paid 0 up front, dedicates all their time and resources for free until if, and when, the judge or jury rules in their clients favor. Then the attorneys collect for all the time and up front resources expended for the past x amount of years spent fighting in court for clients, who up until that point have paid 0, by earning a percentage of the total award. The attorneys deserve to be compensated for their time and effort and taking the risk on the case. Letâ€™s not position it as if the lawyers are doing their clients a disservice by finally getting paid a percentage of the total recovery at the end.
