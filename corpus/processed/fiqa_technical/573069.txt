Surprised that no one has mentioned **Dun & Bradstreet** yet. A lot of small businesses require a D&B number for various reasons (getting an extended verification SSL cert, applying for government contracts, etc). D&B numbers are *free*, but the D&B sales guys will lie and threaten you about expensive up-sells over the course of many phone calls before you can actually get it. Then once you have the number, they send this bullshit spam saying that your credit report has changed, but you got to pay to know what they're saying about you. Sorry for the rant, just D&B is the scummiest company I've dealt with in a long time.
