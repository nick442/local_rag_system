If you want to work within that constraint, then I sincerely suggest you find a credit councilor. It may take you a while to dig out of debt, but with a little help from someone that knows the ropes, you can do it! Remember, even though you want to pay back those debts, many times the sky-rocketing interest rates work against you. Most of the good councilors know how to work the system to get these rates reduced, and sometimes even get the interest you've already accumulated reduced.
