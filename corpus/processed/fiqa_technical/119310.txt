I'm interning right now for the state and it gets boring but I like to ask around for work. I tend to be a multi-tasker and take on several projects at once to keep me sane. They even recruit me to work for other departments outside of mine. The more stuff I do, the better it looks on my resume even if this isn't what I want to do. It benefits all parties to take on more work and responsibilities. If it's engineering, just work your tail off where you are right now and apply for other positions for the school you're in. Network with professors and such to see if they can help you out or with your career service center to see if there are some positions in other places. Best thing you can do is always keep your feet moving. It keeps depression away and benefits you in the long run.
