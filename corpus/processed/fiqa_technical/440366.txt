"I have them and they screwed up signed me up for a $25 a month internet plan then when my internet wasn't working on the date it was supposed to be activated I called them and they suspended my account till a technician could come by. I live in a super old house so I expected problems. That's fine. A week later I had internet but my bill was changed to $50 a month and a different account number. And there is apparently ""no record"" of $25 a month even or account even happening."
