I mean, look at how he reacts to deaths caused by muslims/immigrants vs his reaction to this incident. He speaks off the cuff with respect to Korean nuclear weapons/muslims yet carefully chooses his words precisely to avoid condemning bigots. Almost seems like someone else is pulling the strings here this time. You have to be kind of an idiot/trump fanatic to not see whats happening here. Also, look at how he talks about the victims of muslim attacks/mexican immigrants vs the lady that died here. Eventually, amid immense pressure he comes out and condems racism/bigotry and then minutes later goes on to complain about how despite doing that he doesn't get any credit for it. Only this manchild can somehow turn this all around to making him the victim.
