"Um, okay. Sorry for being in a different place than you. Fuck me, right? I'm in my 30s, grew up in a dilapidated trailer, dirt poor, no ""big screen"" TVs, no AC in our car (if it worked that day), alcoholic/absent dad, started working under the table when I was 14, didn't go to college, didn't get a loan or some other financial windfall -- and worked my fucking way up to reserving the Mustang or Charger when I travel for business. So go fuck yourself. Good luck with everything in the future, though."
