Chiming with my experience, because I hate generalizations of an entire country. I'm Indian, born and raised, but came to the US to do my undergrad/uni and now work out of the US. I had a lot of the same qualms about working with my Indian peers, but I've found that it also depends on the support structure that companies offer. High turnover is definitely an issue, but that seems to be because companies focus more on hiring and less on retention (offering signing bonuses but then little to no continued progress, limited growth opportunities, rigid hierarchy, terrible working hours). I have someone who reports to me in India now and it's an experiment on how to better engage them, and it's worked better. Turns out you can expect more when you also treat them like an American employee while expecting american results. There are definitely still cultural clashes in work ethic etc. but they can be overcome if you get people to stick around long enough. Of course, this is anecdotal but that's my two cents.
