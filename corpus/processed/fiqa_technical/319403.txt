As a recent college graduate that's my main piece of advice to every incoming freshman.. Take gens eds.. If you want to be a paleontologist you are not going to take a semester in Africa to dig up bones your first semester. First semester you are going to take English 101, biology, geography and college algebra so that the rest of your classes make sense.
