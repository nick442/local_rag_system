Oh dear, this corrupt toad and his family were most beneficial for the Indians, rumored to have sugar mills and financial interests in India. His departure and weak leadership aimed at increasing his own personal wealth will be quite a blow to India. Ahhhh . .Pakistan . .always in the thick of it, with nuclear weapons. Soon, after the example of North Korea and Pakistan, which would long have gone the way of Libya, Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, but for Nuclear weapons, it seems inevitable that the Middle east beginning with Iran will go nuclear, it is the only viable option vs the US Israel nexus. Then I guess Zionism will move to California, it already has control of the white house.
