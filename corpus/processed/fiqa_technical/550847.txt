"Right now we're producing enough food feed everyone on the planet 5359 kcal per day ([FAO](http://www.fao.org/docrep/015/i2490e/i2490e03a.pdf)), around twice of what they need. In the US we're throwing away around 40% of the food we produce, and we're not using all available land, haven't even tried optimizing land use, and not all land used for animal farming is usable for growing crops. And meat isn't a problem for emissions, I posted this in [another thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Documentaries/comments/558vdq/trailer_before_the_flood_2016_documentary_movie/d89jvuu/): --- Global GHG emissions from animal agriculture, including deforestation, is just 14.5% ([FAO/IPCC](http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/197623/icode/)). And in the US where you don't have deforestation issues *all* agriculture, including crops grown for human consumption, is just 8.1% of emissions: > In 2012, emission sources accounted for in the Agricultural chapters were responsible for 8.1 percent of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. *Environmental Protection Agency*, [""Sources of Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Agriculture""](http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/Downloads/ghgemissions/US-GHG-Inventory-2014-Chapter-6-Agriculture.pdf). The 2015 draft also shows that this is declining, as a percentage, to 7.6% ([chapter 5](http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/pdfs/usinventoryreport/US-GHG-Inventory-2015-Chapter-5-Agriculture.pdf)). Meanwhile we have 31% from electricity and another 27% from transportation: [Sector emission chart](http://imgur.com/r9qavFg) *EPA,* [""Sources of Greenhouse Gas Emissions""](http://www3.epa.gov/climatechange/ghgemissions/sources.html). Switching to clean energy, solar/wind/nuclear, and moving to alternative fuels would make a huge impact and address the actual problem far more efficiently. Blaming animal agriculture is just a [red herring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_herring) pushed by groups with other motivations than climate change, it's not based on actual science."
