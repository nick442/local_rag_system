Because, without the govt backstopping/guaranteeing that your local liberal arts degree student will have money to pay for their education, banks who make loans would have to worry about the student's ability to repay those loans. The likelihood goes up dramatically for STEM majors so ergo, there would be fewer non-STEM majors because those majors would have to be, more than now, self funded.
