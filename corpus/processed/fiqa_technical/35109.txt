I'm finishing up a PhD in econ this year. I did a similar route to you. M.A. in finance / econ - split with business school and economics department then moved into a PhD. If I had to do it over again, I would go straight into the PhD program. I'd say skip the MA, especially since you have an interest in academia. The MA was more or less a waste of time and you get the MA as you're doing your PhD work anyway.
