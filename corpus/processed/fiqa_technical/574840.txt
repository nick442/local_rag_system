Are you sure these farmers sell straight to wall mart? There are always companies involved between big farms and grocery stores. They deliver the freshest produce to the higher end grocery stores first because they will pay more for it. If a particular batch is going bad or doesn't pass inspection, the only companies that take it are Walmart and juice companies, speaking from experience (family business). Once a batch has gone bad you lose all value and you don't get paid, no insurance even.
