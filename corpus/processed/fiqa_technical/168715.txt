Ok so what they list as failures are: 1. HP killing off webos and almost getting out of the next to 0 margin pc manufacturing business. This is only a failure if you think WebOS had a chance against apple, google and even blackberry, and if you think selling Yet Another China Built Laptop is a good business model. 2. Netflix raising its prices and trying to kill off its barely profitable(loss-making?) DVD business. Price increase was probably a bad idea, but the DVD thing is a good long term decision since let's be real here, DVD is fucking dead. 3. Killing Flip. Probably a good idea seeing as everyone suddenly had HD capable phones. Yeah, probably a bad idea to buy it in the first place, but at least they're not sunk cost fallacy'ing over it. And the MBAs were right. Perfect is the enemy of good. Name one fucking ground breaking gadget that wasn't broken as fuck on release. Remember the iPhone 1? That thing was a fucking turd. iPhone 4? Barely capable of taking a phone call. The first Macbook Pros? Shit chipset that had a tendency to overheat and melt. And those are products from the God Emperor of gadgets. Actually, all you need to know about the author is this: >Iâ€™ve never worked a 9-to-5 job
