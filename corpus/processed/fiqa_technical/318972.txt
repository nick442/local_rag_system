rawbdor is spot on both in terms of the divident yield and the ratings. BAC and C should have no dividend at all. They have liquidity due to the FED but they still have loads of debt that needs to be written off. For all intents and purposes they bankrupt but are kept alive as zombie banks by the FED and the market is pricing them as such. As we've seen time and again, the ratings agencies are lagging indicators regarding value. Once the market loses faith in an enterprise, the ratings agencies have no choice but to downgrade. The *only* reason the major agencies are in business is because they are a state sanctioned oligopoly. Essentially mutual/ money market funds cannot operate without these agencies by law.
