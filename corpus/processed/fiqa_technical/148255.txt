Yeah but some of the managers are complete dicks with your scheduled hours. Both my neighbors work there and he says that some night, he'll get a phone call at 1 am telling him to be at work in 2 hours instead of his typical shift. they also apparently fire people for the most trivial reasons. Very few of my friends who work there actually like the place but it's a job and in this city, it's pretty much take it or leave it. :(
