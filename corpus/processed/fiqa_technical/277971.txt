"The downside of the store card is that the ""deal"" for using the card is typically 6-12 months of ""no payments"" or ""no interest"". In reality, the ""deal"" is deferred payments/interest. The problem is, if you miss any payment, or fail to pay the computer off in full, you'll have to pay for the accrued interest -- at a rate typically 25% or higher. That means if you buy your computer for $1,000, and pay $999 at the end of 12 months, you may have to pay $250 in accrued interest. These cards can be great deals, just be really careful!"
