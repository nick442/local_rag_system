At my company, we set up a secondary WiFi for cell phones/personal devices that is segregated from our primary network. And most people have two phones, a work phone and a personal phone (although you are allowed to use your work phone for personal calls). It's just being smart - if you quit or are fired and you've only been using your work phone, say goodbye to your contacts.
