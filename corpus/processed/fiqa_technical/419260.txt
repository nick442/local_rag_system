Its also a lot easier to run an electric cable to a car than a pipe containing flammable liquid. Plus, since electricity is a utility (gas is a commodity), there is tons of room for municipal investment that will generate cash for cities down the line. Make free parking spots for electric cars only and have people pay for the amount of power they charge onto their battery. Tack it onto their home electricity bill rather than onto a separate thing.
