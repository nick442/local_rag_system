As long as tax cuts for the rich and increases in the military budget are considered sacrosanct; while universal education and healthcare are considered luxuries the deficit will increase. For their taxes Europeans get free education for life through graduate school, a healthcare system that American's would want if they were allowed to know it existed, child care, clean streets, a justice system that has the lowest recidivism rate in the world and a stable middle class. For our taxes, Americans get parasitic billionaires and fighter jets that can't fly in the rain.
