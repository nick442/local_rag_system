Considering how expensive insurance is now, We need to try single payer and any other means to lower our costs. The problem today is that people without healthcare (e.g. Do not seek healthcare when a low cost option would work). The result is that by the time uninsured go to the hospital it is very expensive. What we have today is not working, we should not have to pay 18-20% of our income to get health insurance.
