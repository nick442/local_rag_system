Maybe but would it be ruined if that 10% was merely moved from DoD money to funding local businesses or something? The downside of defense funding is that even if it provides jobs, it's not self sustainable, whereas if you used that money to fund startups/local businesses, those things could potentially eventually grow or at least not require additional funding. Then your city would not require outside funding to survive which is even better no?
