Ok I read the article and yeah I'm completely off topic. It's opening up the possibly for people to create apps etc or retrieve information from it. I guess an example would be a booking site linked to airbnb availability. Maybe we'll see a combo site including hotel space availability as well as airbnb availability. I've also heard of VRBO if that's a real thing.
