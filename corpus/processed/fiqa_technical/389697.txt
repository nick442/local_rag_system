"You realize that no matter what we need janitors right? We need cooks at McDonalds, we need those low end jobs to function as a society. So no matter how educated we get there will ALWAYS be someone at the bottom. You can't just tell them to get more education because everyone is doing that. Even if that individual does, then someone else is now at the bottom. Now, I don't know the answer to the overall question of minimum wage but your ""solution"" is ridiculous."
