I think the issue is that you're looking for it to be a standalone platform. SoundCloud for a long time has been unique in what it offers compared to other music streaming platforms. It's not primarily meant for the end user, but more so as a platform for artists to host their music. It's been the place to listen to new up and coming rappers, tons of producers and even band demos. Who knows how many artists have gotten their start from SoundCloud. Not as an end all music streaming library like Spotify. I guess it comes down to the user. But for people who love to dig for new stuff, nothing compares to SoundCloud.
