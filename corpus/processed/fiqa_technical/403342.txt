Aahhahahah Bestbuy? Are you fucking kidding me? I went to three Bestbuys in two different states this month. Both had at least 150 or so cars in the parking lot and the place was fucking packed. Yeah, I know it's cool for Reddit to hate Bestbuy, but don't blind yourself in to thinking Bestbuy has a failing business, because it doesn't.
