Well, I can tell you that most of the executive staff at GoDaddy don't even live in Phoenix where HQ is. They fly in sometime on Monday (some on Sunday, to be fair) and then work until sometime late Thursday and fly home. Long weekends, every weekend. The rest of us (when I worked there) enjoyed our quiet Mondays and Fridays.
