I closed an account with them for an unrelated reason (down payment brought account below minimum and I didn't want to switch types of accounts or pay a fee) and it was super easy. I was surprised at how quick the whole process was. That said, I didn't have a brokerage or even any CDs - just checking and savings and my automatic payments were tied to other bank acccounts.
