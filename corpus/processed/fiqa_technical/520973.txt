It bothers me how your being downvoted in a goddamn business sub. Like I get people like Tesla and think it's going to be a good company but as of right now this company doesn't make money and isn't that the whole point of a business? Sure it might have huge and amazing potential but that's all it is: potential. I like Tesla as much as the next guy. I'm kicking myself for not buying the stock when I first saw it mentioned on Reddit and I considered buying it. That was at like $70. But there is a simple fact that the company may be overvalued. It's valued like a tech company when it's currently operating like a car company. Sure you can argue they are really a tech company or will be in the future when/if they dominate the battery market but then that means news like this shouldn't even make a dent on their price. You gave your simple and valid reasons for why you wouldn't buy Tesla. But obviously people don't want to hear it and will downvote it instead of actually making a discussion from it. Sometimes I think that Elons marketing team has Reddit completely figured out and is just abusing it.
