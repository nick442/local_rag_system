Not that much money gets stuffed into mattresses, but a lot of money enters the black market and cannot be used until cleaned, a lot of money enters offshore banks to hide it, a lot of money that is intended to be trickled down to consumers for the purposes of commerce gets diverted into consolidating ownership of corporations, etc. There is definitely a tipping point at which consumers lack liquidity to participate in constant commerce, which impedes economic performance, without a doubt, depending on the extent it undermines opportunity.
