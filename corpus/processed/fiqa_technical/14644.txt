"Delta airlines like most of corporate america basically amounts to an organization of thieves. They wasted 2 hours of my time with this same bait and switch tactic this author wrote about. You hit purchase button, and the fair goes up ""due to demand"". Just like the author I went back through the website and tried to buy the ticket again, which was still being advertised at the original price only to have the same message at the end of the process, saying ""due to demand the ticket price has gone up"" Charlatans, thieves, assholes! Wasted so much of my time today! How can this be legal? I hope Delta goes out of business. They certainly wont get any more of mine!"
