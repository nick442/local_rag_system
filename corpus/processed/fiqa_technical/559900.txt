I think it is clear that this has a lot to do with keeping salaries down. The company has a maximal possible salary limit (i.e. the most they would be willing and able to pay) for what you do. You have a minimal possible salary. Both of you know that the current salary is in between the two figures. For negotiations it would be very useful for you to know the maximal possible salary (i.e. the utmost the company would be willing to pay you to stay and continue); the company on the other hand is obliged to keep costs low and hence would like to know your new minimum acceptable salary so they won't make an offer too high. But if you knew all salaries of people around you -- you could make a better guess about your own maximal possible salary. You probably would over-estimate it because we all tend to over-estimate our own relevance and competence, but it would be a better informed guess at least. The company would hence give up an informational advantage which could lead them to have higher costs. So they will ask you how much you were offered at the competitor (i.e. they will be close to your new minimum acceptable salary) while trying to prevent you from learning anything about the maximal possible salary.
