"Yes, that's all they do. It's effectively an ""automatic saving/investing"" program. Bank of America does something similar with ""Keep the Change"", transferring the leftovers from checking to savings. The basic concept here is that people are lousy at saving, so if you put money into savings/investments in some way that is not in your control, it will be better than if you do it under your control even if it costs something because you're going to spend whatever your checking account balance is - so if that balance is artificially reduced, you'll not spend that money and instead have it in savings. This may be effective for some people, I don't know. Not something I would touch with a ten foot pole."
