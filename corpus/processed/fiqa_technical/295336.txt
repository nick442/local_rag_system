"My roommate works for Regal as a theater manager so I think I can help here. As a general rule of thumb for tracking performance, they use: Concession sales divided by attendance (industry lingo is ""per cap""). The higher the ratio, the better the theater did. Most people don't know that theaters make most of their money off of concessions, not ticket sales. The majority of the money that you pay for the movie ticket is actually money that goes to Hollywood, etc. Hope this helps! If you have more questions, let me know and I'll pick my roommate's brain."
