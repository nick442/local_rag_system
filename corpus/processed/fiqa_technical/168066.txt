"Ah, I just read a fascinating comparison between *gambling, investing, and trading* on either /r/foodforthought, /r/depthhub or maybe /r/truereddit. It reminded me a lot of the ""investors"" in Trump's projects. My take on it is anyone putting money into one of his projects does so with the awareness of his track record, and is simply playing the game at that level. If they somehow haven't protected themselves against the possible loss of their ""investment"", that would be as silly as failing to carry health/homeowner/vehicle insurance. One obvious response is to sue, alleging that Trump is evil, and that he intentionally stole money from his hapless investors. Finance at that level is a strategy game. He happens to be a skilled player, and especially adapt at extracting himself from seemingly losing positions. Personally, I wouldn't play at his table."
