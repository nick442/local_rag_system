"I'm not sure that malice or 'bad people' is the true problem. Surely it will exist in small samples, but that will be the exception. I think the problem norm is boring, routine work. I'll explain: Given mundane tasks, people unconsciously start to shortcut. They begin taking normal things for granted and they lose the care they originally put into the work. When these employees first started this job, it's likely they were very ""kind"" to the turkeys and put extra care into the details of their job. They were probably also very slow and compared to seasoned employees, their throughput was low. Over time, they begin to shortcut. Their throughput increases and they start to match seasoned employees. But they've lost the detail. They get a little sloppy, they treat the turkeys a little rougher. The minute detail continues to erode with enough repetition that you wind up with employees doing tremendously cruel things to the animals, simply because they are so overexposed and desensitized to the work. The turkey is no longer an animal, it's now become a widget. A widget to move, process, and package. I won't get into solutions because there's a great number of them that'll work, but I'm not convinced that terrible turkey tyrants are running farms. The type and layout of work has evolved normal employees into this."
