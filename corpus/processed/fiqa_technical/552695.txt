"No kidding. I'm not a fan of ""sales guys"" as a whole, but being paid commission alone is just insulting. As far as I'm concerned, it's pretty much just asking to have all your customers poached by a competitor that doesn't jerk people around when said sales guy ultimately leaves for a better position in 6 months -- because you'd have to be kind of a moron to do that job without some other benefit to make it worthwhile."
