"Well again, I think you're grasping at straws to try to justify monopoly. It's entirely possible that in a free market, there will be some rich individuals who choose to risk it all and hire a small army to attack their enemies or destroy property. But the whole point is that their armies will be far less-powerful than the militaries governments currently have, and they won't have popular acceptance as ""legitimate"". I'm well aware that anarchy wouldn't be a cake-walk. The only claim I'm making is that it would be superior to what we currently have - a system whereby a monopolist extorts millions of people each year for 1/3 of their income, and educates their children for the first 18 years of their lives. That kind of centralization of power is extremely dangerous. >Your security will have to be handled somehow. Do you think calling something a ""fee"", perhaps, changesmthe fundamental nature of the payment? Of course not. We believe that people should pay for their security voluntarily, just like they pay for their food and clothes. Most people probably wouldn't even need security - just some cameras, a fence, and a small gun. Some societies are more violent than others, naturally. We don't expect Anarchocapitalism to spring up in a particularly violent society, as they tend to disrespect property rights anyway. We think its genesis will happen in a first-world, atheist, non-violent country like Denmark or New Zealand. >Again, explicitly, how are you going to handle security? I take umbrage with the way you've phrased this. I will not be handling anything. It is up to consumers to decide what is best for them, and entrepreneurs to experiment to determine the best way to do things. The market is a system of trial-and-error, like the scientific process. Here's a video of one possible way it could be done: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kPyrq6SEL0"
