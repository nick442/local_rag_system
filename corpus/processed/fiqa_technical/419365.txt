"It's not about emotions at first. Humans are easily corrupted, our systems and games easily rigged and cheated. Ideologies perverted and prophets obscenely used by ""interests"".

So, it's about your neighbor who allows the kids to get dumb on TV whole day, you when you allow others to spout retrograde bullshit, me when I cop out and do the same with my family, and so everyone else has the shared burden, some are completely unaware of course on their subtle yet important influence on our cultural trajectory. (And now you can just hate everybody for the right reasons!)"
