"hey there /u/PostNationalism -- you are relentlessly posting only from one single source, ""aei.org"". whats up with that? looking at ""aei.org"", its the ""American Enterprise Institute"": >The Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) is a advocacy group based in Washington DC with long ties to tobacco disinformation campaigns and more recently to climate change denial. It calls itself ""a non-profit, non-partisan research and advocacy institute dedicated to the principles of free enterprise and limited government. We believe that individuals are best helped not by government intervention, but by making their own choices in a free marketplace.""[1] The Competitive Enterprise Institute is an ""associate"" member of the State Policy Network, a web of right-wing “think tanks” in every state across the country.[2] > >Until August 2007 CEI's website CEI stated that it served ""as both a think tank—creating intellectual ammunition to support free markets—and an advocacy organization—putting that ammunition to use in persuasive ways.""[3] > It postures as an advocate of ""sound science"" in the development of public policy. However, CEI projects dispute the overwhelming scientific evidence that human induced greenhouse gas emissions are driving climate change. They have a program for ""challenging government regulations"", push property rights as a solution to environment problems, opposed US vehicle fuel efficiency standards, and spin for the drug industry. > >Many of its claims have been debunked. Here are a few examples related to climate change: > >Annenberg Political Fact Check, ""Scientist to CEI: You Used My Research To ""Confuse and Mislead,"" May 26, 2006. > >""Thank you for emitting"", Real Climate, May 18, 2006 > >News Bureau, University of Missouri-Columbia, ""MU Professor Refutes National Television Ads Downplaying Global Warming: Engineering Professor Curt Davis says TV Spots are Misrepresenting His Research,"" May 19, 2006. > astonishingly, they have financial ties to the Koch Brothers: > >Charles G.
