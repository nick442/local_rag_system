Get a loaf of sourdough bread, slice it lengthwise, smear some Dijon mustard and sour cream on it, place some sliced pepperoni and jack cheese and jalape√±o peppers between the bread halves, wrap it in tin foil and place it on the manifold. Drive for at least twenty minutes. Stop. Pop the hood. Remove the sandwich, protecting your hand from the heat with a rag or napkin. Unrap the tin foil. Eat. Yum!
