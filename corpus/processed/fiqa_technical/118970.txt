Nor how uneducated as to what options they have or more importantly who will pay for those options since they are probably just as broke as they were before the kid. > At what point do people's bad decisions stop being society's burden to bear? This isn't that point. > If I decide to take on insurmountable debt because I don't know any better, should everyone else be forced to pick up the tab? Not really a fair comparison, but no I don't think we should let you starve. Idiot or otherwise. > A $15/hr minimum wage would ruin our economy and cause a lot more suffering and homelessness.
