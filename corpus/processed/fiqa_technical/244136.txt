It means that supply of labor is greater than demand. Therefore wages are suppressed as people compete over the few jobs available. The unemployment rate is misleading because people drop off the statistic even though in a functional sense they're still looking for work. Many of the open positions available aren't in immediate need of filling. A lot of job ads have laundry lists of nice to have qualities and skills that most experienced people don't have. From the employer's perspective they'd rather hold out for the dream candidate and make existing employees work more unpaid overtime than take a risk hiring someone who doesn't meet their wildest dreams.
