This article leaves quite a bit of information out, I gather. Poorly written. How many corporations is he getting paid from? What were the terms of the agreement? It sounds like Kiyosaki himself isn't going bankrupt, it sounds like some small, off-shoot is taking the brunt of the damages so the rest of his assets can move on. This guy knows how to protect himself and his companies. This could be nothing more than a parking ticket for him, and this news website decided to sensationalize it. What a surprise.
