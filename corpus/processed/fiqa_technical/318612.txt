I work for Businessfriend and would love to answer these questions. Now mind you, we are in beta, so we don't expect the site to work perfectly yet, but I do hope you guys explore it. We see our selves very different from Linkedin, matter of fact we don't compare ourselves to Linkedin at all. Our site does not stop at networking, we provide common business utilities behind a social ecosystem to ideally improve productivity at work. Our tools consist of a calendar, to do list, chat (instant message), and plenty more. I went ahead and set up a demo account for you guys to use if you are interested, because this is set up with my own email I am going to only leave it live for a week. The login is Email: p.diehl@businessfriend.com Password: Password123. I have added 3 Businessfriend team members to the contacts so you can talk to us directly and let us know what you think. You will be connected with Philip Diehl (me), Nick Alesi, and Rob Rosales. Enjoy! -Phil
