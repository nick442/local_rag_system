There isn't a single career or major that US education system is unable to churn out an abundance of graduates. There isn't a software language in the USA that a USA company needs, that India has experience with, but the USA does **not** have experience with. Immigrants come to the USA for an education, not the other way around. We don't see countless Americans going to India for their computer science degree because USA schools are just not good enough. This holds true for economics, chemistry, physics, and any other discipline. The immigrants are not more skilled, and are typically lower skilled. They are just cheaper, that is all. Undocumented immigrant labor was welcomed by Wall Street for decades because it broke the working class unions. Well paying white collar jobs are also being given to immigrant labor to drive down costs, it is that simple.
