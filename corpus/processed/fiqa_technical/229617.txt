Women entered the work force en mass. And, with twice as many potential employees the cost of labor decreased. That is, of course, the non-PC version and it began earlier than the 80s but it's essentially correct--labor like any other commodity increases in value relative to its scarcity. If all the women (or all the men, or all of any sizeable group) left the labor market the price of labor would begin to increase as companies bid up the price they were willing to pay for each employee. With today's level of globalization this becomes a much more complicated equation--do local wages rise or do jobs migrate to abundant (and cheap) labor? But, it's the same idea.
