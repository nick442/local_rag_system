In Louisiana there's no law against selling any type of alcohol from a drive through. Other states like Texas, has a law limiting the sell of hard drinks from drive-thrus. This limits their customer base to on site sales and drinking. Because hundreds more customers can be served a night, there are a LOT more Daquri places in La.
