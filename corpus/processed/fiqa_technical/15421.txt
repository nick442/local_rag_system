>if the Millenials are still hard up for work), then employers will likely defer to candidates that they deem to be more mature. Realistically, they would likely think the younger one is more mature. Reason being, a Gen Y'er that has been unemployed for a while, companies make the assumption that there must be something wrong with them if noone hired them. Not special to Gen Y though. Anyone who is unemployed for a long period of time they make that assumption. The longer you are unemployed, the less likely companies want to hire you, it's a vicious circle.
