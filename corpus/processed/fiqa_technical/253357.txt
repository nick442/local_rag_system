I'll extend an olive branch here and concede that we have a lot more luxuries which is why we have more to work and pay for. But my point is we could have more or less the same amount of stuff by working 3 days a week. I've heard that millenials are less materialistic than previous generations, so it will be interesting to see the effects of that. Also, we need to take into account that AI likely will replace a large amount of jobs in the future as well. Maybe it will be even more plausible for most people to only work 3 days a week on average.
