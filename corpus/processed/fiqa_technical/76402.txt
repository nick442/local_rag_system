"I was talking to a hiring manager friend the other day and he's telling me he can't find anyone with experience in this specific steel testing software. I asked about it, apparently it was made for only in company use, completely proprietary and custom for their operations and he's scratching his head about why these young metallurgists straight out of college don't know about this testing software and how it's used and that they are ""completely useless for the role"". Jesus fucking Christ, those are smart kids they can figure out how to click the buttons in the software give them a chance."
