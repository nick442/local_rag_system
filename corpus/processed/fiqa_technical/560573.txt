"In any technical field practitioners have difficulty explaining general/abstract concepts to outsiders. They're accustomed to using a particular set of concepts and ideas that make communication fast and easy between their colleagues, but make communication difficult with outsiders who don't know that language. It's usually easy to come up with a mediocre analogy that communicates the gist of the idea, but finding analogies that capture the complete essence of the concept is extremely hard (and maybe impossible). Have you studied mathematics? Try explaining the concept of a ""continuous function"" in all its generality without talking about epsilons and deltas or open sets and inverses. You can talk about ""drawing a line and not picking up your pencil"", but that's not quite what a continuous function is. Likewise, if you've studied law, try explaining what a ""security interest"" is in its full generality without talking about liens or pledges. You can come up with specific examples, sure, but it'll be tough to find one that captures the whole concept. I'm sure you can come up with examples from whatever field it is you specialise in. Added to this is the problem that the skill-set needed to be a good translator across disciplines isn't really valued in most corporations, including banks. EDIT: I accidentally a word."
