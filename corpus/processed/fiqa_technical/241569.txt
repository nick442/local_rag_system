Put simply for me, having an 800g device which outperforms my older macbook pro, and therefore not needing to carry my heavy laptop, charger, and tablet into college or work. I could get a Macbook Air, but then i'd still want my tablet. I could get an iPad but then i'd still need my laptop. I also really really like the digitizer.
