"The best advice I can give you is that you need to start on math *now*. I made the same mistake as OP and didn't realize that going up in finance would require as much math as it does. Granted, I was undergrad finance not marketing like him, so maybe it was a little better for me, but if you really want to do upper level finance do NOT skimp on math. It's easy to fall into the trap doing cal 2 your sophomore year and thinking ""I won't really need this"" and just doing the minimum to get through it. For undergrad, that's true. For Master's you'll need it. This happened to me, and I suffered a LOT because of it. Your professors in the master's program will likely give you a crash course in what you need to know, but you won't have a real understanding of it unless you took (and did really well in) those math classes beforehand. To answer your question, 1. Maybe. You should definitely take cal 1 early. Depending on how you can hold on to the information, cal 2 can wait a bit, so it's fresher when you start doing upper level finance your second half of junior year/senior year. 2. Upper level finance is a whole different beast from lower level finance. Same with economics. If you're not good at math, if you don't enjoy math, it might not be the best choice. I'm not good at math, and the undergrad finance wasn't too bad. However, the master's program was very very not fun. EDIT: YMMV, but I don't recommend going straight into the master's program straight out of undergrad. Work (in industry!) for a bit first. The jobs you need to a master's for won't hire you straight out of undergrad, so it'll be dead weight. Experience is what you need."
