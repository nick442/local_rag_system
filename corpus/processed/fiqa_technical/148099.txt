"Modern airlines are one of the most amazing technological achievements in human history. Think about it-- you can travel across the country or even across the world, in a matter of hours, more safely than driving across town, for less money than any time in history. It's not a great experience but it sure beats a wagon train, a 3 masted ship, or walking. But the airlines can't figure out how to make money doing it. Whenever ""fees"" and other non-core revenue starts accounting for your profit, your business is in trouble. Think of the GM's financing arm, that made more money for GM than making cars. Or Blockbuster with late fees. (Btw, I have no problem in principle with baggage fees-- transporting stuff seems to be part of the core business of an airline. Encouraging everyone to stuff the cabin full of carry-ons is another matter.)"
