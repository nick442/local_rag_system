"Yes, the world was very poor, things were supposed to change and people could live better lives, but now people live at home until 28 just to try and have a home of their own. And we argue that this is preferable, for some stupid reason. If you stopped sitting on your ass and actually learn a skill, you can move out earlier than this. I moved out at 23 and have had no problems finding jobs, even with a terrible economy. Nobody is going to hand you a good job. You have to earn it. ""You did make a sound financial decision, in a warped, lopsided society that lets rich people get away with murder. Romney pays 14% of his income to taxes? pfft, this IS class warfare, and the lower and middle classes are losing."" How many jobs did Romney create? All of those jobs = tax dollars going into our economy. The rich pay more than anyone else and you still complain!! 50% of the US population don't even pay federal income taxes. It's class warfare because you have this fucked-up mentality that the rich are somehow doing something wrong for earning more than everyone else."
