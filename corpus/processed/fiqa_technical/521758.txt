the crude estimate of missing jobs rises to about 75,600. You think 75k jobs is a blip? And that is out of a -0.2 employment elasticity. As people continue to ask for higher minimum wage, by law, that elasticity will undoubtedly increase. There is no question about it. I mean, sure those who keep their jobs are better off, no one doubts that, but there will surely be more unemployment. EDIT: Sorry I took so long to respond, had to do some other things and I wanted to make sure I gave the article you sent a good read.
