I think its crazy seeing the comments here. did nobody thoroughly read the article? business owners have to make sure that their businesses succeed. drugs, even marijuana, are not a risk that insurance want to take. when the costs of operating a business go up, the money left to hire people goes down. if im spending 5 million in insurance to cover marijuana medical bills, instead of say, 1 million to not cover marijuana, then thats 4 million i dont have to pay workers better wages. people need to get a better balanced life view. i understand that people want their liberties to do as they see fit, but in doing so they fail to see that other people are under no obligation to hire you if you are making choices that have the potential to hurt the business bottom line.
