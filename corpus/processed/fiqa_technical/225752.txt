I have everything you have and a nap room, coffee bar, game room and a whole bunch of other good shit. You can have both. It doesn't have to be one or the other. My boss is awesome too and also lets my coworkers work from home on a regular basis. My boss also had a talk with me when I worked a lot one week and offered me flex days (extra PTO days). I also work under 30 hours a week and only hit above that a handful of times a year.
