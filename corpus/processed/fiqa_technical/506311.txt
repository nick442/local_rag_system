i've had a few friends who tried it out for shits a giggles with a very small amount of money (a couple hundred at most) and with enough diversification, they basically broke even, or lost a little bit. With enough free time, i had a friend look into very specific companies that were offering cheap stock, and guessed on if they thought these companies would be successful given market potential, and yeah, it really was a crap-shot on whether the'd make a damn thing.. After fees for making the trades and the crazyness of penny stocks, ultimately, they wasted time and lost a small amount of money.
