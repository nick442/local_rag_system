You do realize we won WWII not by having the most advanced technology, but by pumping out SO DAMN MANY that the War Machine required. The Russians did this as well, while the Germans were obsessed with developing superior technology or having mechanically elegant solutions (like their tanks). We made simple jackhammers. By the bucketload and literally out produced our way to victory.
