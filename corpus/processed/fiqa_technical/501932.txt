"I'm just really getting sick of these ""omg, free market"" bullshit arguments. These regulations didn't spring up all over the country without reason. Discrimination, red-lining, and rate gouging were all issues the taxi industry faced at one time. Taxi regulators put these rules into effect to protect customers and assure that people using public transportation could get to where they needed to go. The difference between Uber/Lyft and taxis that follow the law is that there is regulatory body that impose fines on companies and cab drivers that violate them. And with enough complaints, the regulators can completely revoke their ability to serve as taxi cabs in a city. Instead you want this free market where the cab drivers can tell their passengers to get fucked if they don't like it. Go read the wiki page on taxi regulation: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab#Regulation I can't find a single instance on there where customers benefited from deregulation."
