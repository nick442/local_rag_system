"Clinical Pharmacist here, not talking out of my ass at all. ""Opioid crisis"", you sound like you're just relaying what you read on CNN and snapchat stories. People addicted to opioids are miniscule compared to the number of people that it's helped. Fact. I see people everyday on Fentanyl and Oxycodone and Hydrocodones. Once you see and realize the type of pain they are in, you understand that this class of medication may be one of the most important ones out there."
