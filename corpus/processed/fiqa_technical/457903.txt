Big mouthed dickhead writing big mouthed childish rant. Uber's a fucking running business, with operations in more than a 100 countries with huge penetration locally in all of them. It's going to take more than its founder and a couple of investors quitting to take it down. It's a system that is in place. Only if the investor money dries up, which I doubt it will in the next 10 years, it will only grow, and maybe it will become better with sexist/incompetent top level executives leaving the company.
