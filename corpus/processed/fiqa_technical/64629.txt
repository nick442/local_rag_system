No, I'm simply saying that there must be some things that no majority is allowed to do, such as throw someone in jail without due process, or outlaw the practice of a minority religion, or seize property without trial. I'm referring to restrictions like those enumerated in the bill of rights.l, which everyone is supposed to abide by. That's what makes a republic different, and better than a democracy.
