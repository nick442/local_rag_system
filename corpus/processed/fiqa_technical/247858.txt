">tax cuts for the rich cause economic harm to the public. and >the Republicans constantly use the stimulus of deficit spending as cover for them. Cracking open a thesaurus and finding synonyms for the word ""bad"" doesn't address the issue. Whether you say tax cuts are bad or harmful, it is the same statement. I agree ""tax cuts are bad"" and your next statement which amounts to ""Republicans are bad"" are different conclusions. They are not necessarily related any more than a bad carpenter choosing a bad hammer explains why each is bad. Fair point if slightly.. irrelevant. It is irrelevant because it does nothing to address the problems with a one-sided narrative or to shift focus from evaluation into fact-based analysis."
