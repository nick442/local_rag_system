"There are few cases where trades were reverted because of a ""technical issues"", for example: When BATS did its IPO its price went down to a few penny due to a computer glitch, because of that the regulators allowed the trades to be reversed as if nothing happened. I think that some trades during the flash crash of the 6 May 2010 were reversed too. However, if the act is clearly fraudulent, they can try to sue the responsible. If a tribunal were to condemn him to reimburse them and that he has enough money to pay for it, they could get their money back. But think of Madoff, the people that invested with Madoff didn't have their investment reversed as Madoff didn't have the money to pay them back. The sames goes with most of criminal, crooks and even rogues traders. Finally, before thinking of reverting anything, there are laws about financial firms to make them implements proper checks to avoid that kind of fraudulent activities as they are responsible for most of the operational risk, especially when it could impact both the firm and their clients. And if the firm doesn't comply with those laws, they are unlikely to get the tribunal on their side if a problem arise."
