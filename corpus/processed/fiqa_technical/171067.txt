LOL!!! Another clueless Trump hater. I will ask again: > **What does Trump has to do with failing of OBAMA(!!)care?** Those issues just started when Trump became a president? > Trump is a shit negotiator, Sure! Obama did a great job negotiating Obamacare. **Let's do this: we will wait for the fixes done by Trump to this failed Obamacare, and we will talk after that?** Ok? > Trump is creating a lot of jobs in criminal defense legal service LOL!! LOL!!! Trump is not under a single investigation, while Hillary was and is under several investigations. Trump is a winner, and liberals like you are losers!!
