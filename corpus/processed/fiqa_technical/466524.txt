I remember buying my first computer from Sears, a Compaq. How things changed blazing around on a 56k, 300 MHz K6, back before Napster was a thing, Yahoo was wrecking AOL, and A/S/L was at the beginning of every chat log. Keeping my computer on all night to download funny wave files to save on floppy, oh yes, times were a changing. I can still imagine the dialup sounds burned into my memory, and dreamt of ram upgrades.
