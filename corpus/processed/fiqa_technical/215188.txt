They shouldn't be bound to them in the first place because you can't delegate a right to someone else that you don't already have yourself. I can't tax you and you can't tax me. It's just theft. And you can't use taxation as justification for ownership of things if you're also using ownership of things as justification for taxation. That's circular logic.
