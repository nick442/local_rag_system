">What's the difference between inheritance and being born with money? Just because someone is born into a rich family, does NOT necessarily mean they will inherit the wealth. Many things can happen along the way between their birth and potential inheritance, everything from the family elders blowing the money, or making bad investments, to divorces/lawsuits, elders being pissed and just disinheriting their heirs, etc. And then of course, just because one reached the point of inheritance, does not guarantee that the money will last. Plenty of ""spoiled rich kids"" end up being impoverished by the end of their life."
