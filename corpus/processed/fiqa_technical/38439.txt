With interest rates as low as they are, you could lock in to a very low rate for 30 years. If rates are higher in, say, 10 years, you could conceivably be earning a much higher rate on the money you're not putting towards monthly payments. All else equal, the payments will be lower on a 30y than they will be on a 10y, so you'll have more cash for other things. But I'm just looking for downsides -- being paid off in 10 years versus 30 sounds nice to me.
