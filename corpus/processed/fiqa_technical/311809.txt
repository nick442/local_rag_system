For sure, a thirst for experience is absolutely a positive thing that will benefit you. I think the lack of ambition might be prevalent in all aspects of work, however. There were definitely the high-achieving people at my office and the ones that couldn't have given two shits how they were performing. Just recognize who's doing a great job and who's really dragging down the team and adopt the habits of the high-achievers. That's how I've always viewed it, anyway.
