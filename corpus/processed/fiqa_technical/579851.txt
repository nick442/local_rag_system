The biggest value driver we identified were staff costs. If Amazon implements their Amazon Go technology in Whole Foods' stores(which I assume is their current plan) they would be able to cut a large chunk of staff costs reducing COGS significantly. With Jana Partners buying up shares and an already large institutional share of ownership we saw the likelyhood of success of a deal to be quite high. The new technology is exciting and we believe interest for shopping at Amazon will be high the first years which brings revenue synergies to the table. I'm on mobile right now(at work) so maybe I can give a more detailed answer later.
