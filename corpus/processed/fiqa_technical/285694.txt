"You are asking if getting a mortgage nearly 4X your income has the potential to make you ""house poor"". $2500 Of your $9000 gross is not too much according to the bank, but the bank only looks at a few ratios, not your entire budget. Is this house appropriate for your needs? At 3X the median home price, are you reaching too high? Note - this board has had multiple ""budget"" discussions recently. For many people, the mortgage is just where the trouble starts. The other house related budget items just multiply up to make things worse."
