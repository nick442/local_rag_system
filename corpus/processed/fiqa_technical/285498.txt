Come on man, the reason Walmart workers are unionizing is because they can't get their employer to follow the law and if any of these workers try to stand up for themselves alone they will lose their job. This is much more about respect then it is about money. Do we really want jobs where your boss can cut your hours in half arbitrarily because he didn't like something you said, or where you have to come to work sick and make food all day because you are not aloud to take sick days? I'm not saying unions are perfect, but they are the only way workers could possibly attain a sense of respect and security in these low paying industries.
