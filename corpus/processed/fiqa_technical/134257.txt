> Yelp told Desloges the good reviews were taken off her main page by an electronic system that uses an algorithm to sort reviews. She was told that's not because the reviews weren't genuine, but most likely because her customers aren't regular Yelp users. uh, that's how yelp works and it makes complete sense to me. she's just whining because she wasn't able to game the system the way she wanted to.
