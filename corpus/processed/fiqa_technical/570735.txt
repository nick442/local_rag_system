So you don't have any trouble with FedGov dictating *national* labor and union-relation laws, and throwing out the differences between various states? Because *that's* the reason this administration is acting in this manner, it has very little to do with franchises; the end result is national dictatorship of wages, hours, and unions by the executive branch. As the article says; if this policy is really what's necessary, why doesn't *Congress* implement it?
