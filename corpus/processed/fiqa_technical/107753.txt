I am suggesting that, on a macro level, a wage increase of 2% would offset a 1% increase in unemployment. More spending power equals more demand, and more demand creates jobs. While hard in the short term, Bob's job will come back but with a higher wage. If your goal is that no one lose their job, capitalism is not the economic system for you.
