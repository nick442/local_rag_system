Hey it’s me, your professor. I’m requiring this book that I wrote, you can purchase it through the publisher only and all previous editions are obsolete. It’s only $250. Along with that you’ll have to purchase the online access code to get your homework, it’s $150. Sometimes you’ll enter the correct answer on the site and it will count it wrong, this is not my problem. Finally, if you have any questions please email me and I’ll be happy to answer them the day after you needed the answer. You can ask me after class, but I’ll just tell you to come during my office hours. On that note, my office hours are by appointment only, email me to schedule one. Oh, and our class that started 5 minutes ago is cancelled. Hope you check your email religiously or else you’ll be waiting for me to show up! Have a great semester!
