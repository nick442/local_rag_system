Yes, I think the undergrad books alone are sufficient to get a general understanding. On the other hand, I would never discourage someone from pushing themselves and you may find reading the grad level books to be quite stimulating. If you're considering grad school sometime in the future then it will also help you get oriented to the language used in those settings. Hull's book is definitely on the less-dry side of material I've read too (well, at least no more dry than the subject matter itself lol), so that shouldn't be an issue. Try the grad book!
