Sounds like Yelp is promoting businesses that pay the highest dollar to get the best results. Filtering positive reviews for people with just one review is understandable (self reviews) but that's NOT what I'm seeing. My site, topfiveawards.com will go local eventually and I won't let it go to the highest bidder. Fuck that.
