The average CIO I've encountered is technically incompetent to the point of not being capable of even self sufficiency with e-mail. They have never worked a day in IT in their life. They are generally an accountant or something and slashing budgets is all they know. IT is a cost centre, blah, blah, blah. They do this without being able to understand the significance of their decisions. They get their opinions from Forrester or Gartner reports they barely understand and which are often echo chambers of what other non-IT CIOs are doing, a.k.a. market trends. Add a sprinkle of whatever turds some smooth talking salesman can throw over the wall. They get bonuses for racking up technical debt under the guise of saving money. Support costs eat the savings and then some, which gets hidden under a mountain of bad bookkeeping and robbing Peter to pay Paul. An army of non-technical project managers spring up under them because of the mistaken belief that non-it people should run IT projects. Costs rise, morale sinks, tech debt skyrockets. People who could provide significant competitive advantage instead spend their days and nights lashing increasingly fragile infrastructures together with duct tape and bailing wire. The solution is obviously labour intensive management frameworks where IT people are made to generate mountains of processes that will amount to nothing when management and the business fail to follow through on their part of the commitment, in the complete absence of any accountability. After they fuck up any advantage to in house IT then it's time to outsource to achieve big savings.. for one year, then prices go up, but they already cashed that bonus check. When they've irrevocably screwed up one company then they move on to a better position, to make a bigger mess. Lather, rinse, repeat. At least I'm not bitter.
