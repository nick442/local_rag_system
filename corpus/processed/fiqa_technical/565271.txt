No. I believe members of congress are passing bills that enrich the rich in return for favors. The type of favors change to avoid being seen as bribery, but it is still bribery. But not every member of Congress is corrupt. Some members are just selfish and irrational, some are clean. We haven’t cracked down on this crap because they’ve done a great job dividing us against each other. They have escalated fracturing to ensure lack of cooperation for those who wish to improve the nation over self-interests.
