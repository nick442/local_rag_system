">I think you mean: 60% of all mortgages on homes in Nevada are underwater. Not every home has a mortgage, so it's not 60% of the homes, it's 60% of the mortgages. Spot on. In the US typically somewhere around 30% to 40% of homes have no mortgage at all (i.e. 100% equity by the owners). So.. *IF Nevada follows the US average* (which it may not, having a lot of new developments) then 60% of 60%/70% would be somewhere between 36% to 42% of homes. That of course, is still HUGE -- if even 10% of homes in a locale are ""distressed"" sales, it is enough to drive prices down. But another caveat is that just because a place is ""underwater"" does not mean that it has a HIGH negative equity -- point of fact is that ANY home bought with an LTV mortgage or a really low down payment (i.e. 0% to 10% down payment) is probably underwater from day one and remains pretty close to that for the first couple of years. Why? Because typical realtor fees are around 6%, and closing costs are easily another couple of percent, add in that with a self-amortizing loan that very little equity is built up in the first few years, and any loss for aging and owner ""cash out"" equity can easily be near zero or negative. (That's one of the reasons you shouldn't buy unless you are planning on living somewhere for at least 5 years, because it takes that long to ""recoup"" the realtor & closing costs -- ergo the whole ""flipping"" phenom is in and of itself a sign that a market is in a speculative bubble.)"
