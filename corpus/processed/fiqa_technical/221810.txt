I used to buy black bean burgers from Costco as occasional quick meals on the go. Reasonably tasty, reasonably healthy and super quick to microwave. Then I ate three in one night in the middle of moving apartments. The smell coming out of me almost made my roommate change his mind about moving in with me. Haven't eaten a vegetable based burger since.
