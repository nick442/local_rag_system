"Yes please! Or maybe 6 months on, 6 months off. I'd be happy doing that until age 70, whereas right now working 12 months a year with only a little vacation here and there .. I just can't wait to be able to retire, keep doing the math every week or two - ""can I live on X for Y years"". I have tons of friends that age as well that are all really disenfranchised by work and dying to retire. This would make life SO much more worthwhile. Problem with retirement being 65+ is that by then you're no where near as able to enjoy the world (imho and just stating the facts, not a diss, and heck this starts happening when you hit 45..)."
