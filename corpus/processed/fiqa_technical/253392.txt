"You did not answer my question: Where's my advocate in the negotiations? Why should I believe the negotiators have my best interests at heart? What's the point of negotiating a treaty that doesn't have the people's interests at heart? You can't just say ""The US Gov is doing it and they have the US Citizens interest at heart""--the whole point of the US Constitution is that citizens of the USA do not trust people in positions of power, and want to make sure those people's interests are aligned with the interests of the population without needing to believe in their benevolence. Every US publicly traded company, for example, holds their shareholders and executives interests far above those of their employees. So giving the companies I mentioned the ability to ""work deals with those jobs on the table"" doesn't sound like it is much of a benefit to those (far greater in number) employees. Do those people get a chance to affect policy decisions too?"
