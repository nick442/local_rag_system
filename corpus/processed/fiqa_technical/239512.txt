Well quite a few countires have tax breaks on the first house you own .. this is typically to promote people to have atleast one house of their own .. having a house of your own provides lot more stability in the long run .. and without tax breaks it makes it difficult for quite a few to own a house .. the tax breaks form a motiviation as well .. There are at times other effects of this breaks, people buying houses beyond their need [bigger house than required] or capacity [buying in a central / expensive location] by maximizing the breaks ..
