Presumably, some of the selling pressure could be from insiders who have been locked up for a while and now that they've gone public, they're cashing out. The problem with snapchat is that unlike when facebook went public, it does not stand alone. Facebook wasn't really fighting anyone for dominance when it went public - it had already won the war and just had to prove its ability to generate a profit. Snapchat is directly in Facebook's crosshairs (instagram) which makes it a tougher situation because not only do they have to prove profitability, they have to fight facebook while doing it.
