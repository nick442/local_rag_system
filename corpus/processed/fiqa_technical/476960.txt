"My wife and I are paid every two weeks. I go on line see the exact deposit, add it to register, and see what checks cleared. In effect, I reconcile twice per month, and the statement can't be different that what their system tells me. Since the online site shows ""last statement balance"" I feel there's no need to bother with the paper, nothing left to reconcile."
