The cable companies are not stupid ALL the time. They realize that every time a household pulls the plug on cable service they will need to work extra hard to get them back. Once people establish a habit getting them to change again is hard (which is why streaming has only begun to take off recently). As such, though the cable companies continue to loudly proclaim that online TV is not costing them (and it may not be yet) each little drop in the bucket will add up over time until the ship is too hard to turn back around. Data limits on internet are just thier first attempt a curbing the mass exodus from cable that is currently underway. Let's not forget that even Hulu is owned by Universal and Netflix, being a publically traded company can be purchased if they make the cable companies REALLY nervous. This is a fight that the cable companies will eventually win unless some other disruptive force intervene's (enter the DoJ)
