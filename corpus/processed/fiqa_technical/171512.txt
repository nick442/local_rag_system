A friend from Shell (Indian by blood/South African by nationality) told me a couple of months ago that China, India, and Russia had a long term plan cooking to run crude through to China from Russia; thence to India via pipeline. This is a real showstopper deal. When I looked it up online, there is evidence it is coming. Who knew about the big gas deal with China? Who knew about this one with Iran? Carnegie.ru (Dmitri Simes) says this whole thing is about control of and regime change of Russia by the US through State Department policy. Notsomuch Ukraine as Russia! Given the US' record with regime changes, if Carnegie is right, this is a huge FAIL. DOOMED!!
