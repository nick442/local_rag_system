Unfortunately, nothing is ever that simple. Do you have any income in the country where you currently live? The US has tax treaties with many countries, and though you may not have tax on the income generated by 401(k) withdrawals in the US, that income may be taxable in your home country. Your best bet at this point is to hire an accountant that is familiar with US tax treaty issues and pay for some advice.
