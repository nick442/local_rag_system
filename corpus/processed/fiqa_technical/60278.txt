True, but I don't think that's our only problem. It's a complicated issue, but we've seen the militarization of police, many people fear the police too much to report serious crimes (which might be reformable, but not if Internal Affairs corruption is anyone's idea of reform). Both of these issues stem from a fundamental lack of respect for the populace at large on the police's behalf, a natural response to seeing society's worst day in and day out. There's also the benefit of having one more level to escalate your issues up. If the insurance company doesn't issue a fair decision, the courts may, and while a police officer doesn't have a legal duty to protect and serve (http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/28/politics/28scotus.html?_r=0), an insurance company has a contract and a service you paid. Also, though I'm not sure how relevant it is in the insurance industry, companies are competing with each other and thus have an incentive to report their competitor's illegal activity, unlike the blue code of silence. These problems may be fixable, but they certainly are not easily so.
