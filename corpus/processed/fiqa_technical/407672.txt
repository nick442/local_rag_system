Both, I own and utalize a ton of Google products but anything outside their advertising or data is lacking long term vision and listless. Reminds of a kid getting bored with their toy in 15 minutes. Makes me fearful for their 20 year+ dominance if their advertisement business slowly gets more competition. They won't be going anywhere, but I don't think they will continue to take over the world.
