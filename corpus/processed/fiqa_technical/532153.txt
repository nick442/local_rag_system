I've been mostly out for a while. My husband and I are worth around $2M. Trade wars, exorbitant rent, tuition debt, unaffordable health care, massive government debt, wealth inequality that's going to explode under Trump, automation, globalization, isolationism, stock market bubble, housing market bubble, lack of real banking reform, record household debt, Republicans controlling all three branches of government. Take your pick.
