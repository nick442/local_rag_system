Lets start off with this: You already know you don't like working with the guy and he doesn't give two shits. >Last month he came to work to tell me he was going to China and that when he comes back he will pump a million into it the business to build a warehouse etc. but he then wanted me to shut this business down, restart a new business with a ridiculous name he has decided on and give me 20% to run it for him. Get the money. Sell your business for whatever you can. Get the 20% from him. See where you are and what you want to do next. Just don't take any risks with him.
