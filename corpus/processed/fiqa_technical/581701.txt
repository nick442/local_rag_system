Yes it is. The government already controls the banks. The fed sets reserve amounts. It is about 20% but they can make it 99% if they wanted. A bank that doesn't meet its reserves loses its charter and is seized. I believe it is Office of Thrift Supervision or something. The president appoints the Fed chairman and congress oversees the Fed. The Fed gives 90%+ profits to the Treasury.
