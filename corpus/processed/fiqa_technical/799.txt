I already said there's no food safety concern. The issue is it's gross. So yes, as I said, it is just my opinion that I think it's icky. That's a perfectly reasonable cause to not eat something. I'm not suggesting it shouldn't be allowed. I'm suggesting it's reasonable that people don't want to eat it.
