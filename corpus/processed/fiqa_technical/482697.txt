"The issue with your point is that government has/does move to make decisions in the markets to institute their political views or agendas. Of which these views and agenda do not often take into consideration any of the unforeseen consequences in the light of market realities. The market realities which I speak of are everything affected by government action from businesses dealing with the cost of extra added government regulation on their bottom line, employee costs, taxes, the impact of subsidies, and price controls, etc in a competitive market where everyone is looking for an edge over their competitors. However with government many times these market realities are often ignored when making broad and over-reaching governmental polices based on political agendas and the whims of the public rather then on solid and sound economic decisions. Which in turn these governmental polices effect many, many more people then businesses acting for their own needs to ensure their survival in the marketplace. Thus having a president who does not or willfully will not acknowledge how government interaction in the market place can create unintended and often negative results is worse in respects to having a president who does understand how the ""bottom line"" is effected via government action and attempts to reconcile both in light of making a decisions that effects the economy as a whole."
