In equity research as an associate. I put in (most weeks-not earnings season) around 55-65 hours but during earnings (1/3 of time) its around 80. There are always good and bad days; its actually quite manageable overall. Occasionally, I have stuff I'm told to do on the weekend, but usually I'm *highly suggested* to average 3-5 hrs on the weekend just to get ahead of the upcoming week.
