of course! Currently I am running a digital media company based in Bangkok, we produce a wide array of content, some for web distribution some that is targeted for traditional distribution. I also have equity in a number of tech startups around Asia, everything from e-commerce to smart home to big data. I also recently exited a quantified self company I had built with several co-founders.
