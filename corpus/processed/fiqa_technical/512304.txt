My friend runs a vocation school for high school students. They have a number of programs where they teach specific machines and techniques to students and companies provide teaching, sponsorship, and hire students. It is a win-win for the school, they get some machinery, a good relationship with a large company, and they get kids hired every year at a very good starting salary. It isn't so specific that the kids are useless anywhere else, the companies just provide curriculum input on what is important.
