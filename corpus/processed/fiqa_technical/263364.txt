That has nothing to do with my statement. My point is that the moves in Bitcoin value are not even *discussed* in the same way as other currencies. When the Japanese yen rises in value, everyone realizes there is simultaneously a fall in some other currency or currencies. And you can look at the other cross-currency prices to see what the real story is. A huge rise in Bitcoin means there is a huge drop in the U.S. dollar value, but that is not matched by any other dollar valuation.
