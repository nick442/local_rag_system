"Not to mention there's no such thing as an ""Economics Nobel Prize"", but to the credit of the OP the term was correctly put in quotations. The prize (propaganda coup) is the Rikksbank Prize in memory of Alfred Nobel, and Nobel himself opposed the concept of a prize in economics. The much more recently created prize was devised only in 1969 by central bankers as a way to promote economists who primarily share and promote the ideology of central banking. They co-opted the Nobel name and bribed the Nobel committee with a lump sum they couldn't turn down, and the rest is history."
