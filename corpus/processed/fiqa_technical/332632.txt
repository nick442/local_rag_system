">Except they're not. Most of human history has been dominated by these societies. Think feudalism with a few nobility on top and a massive surf class below them. But the differences in lifestyle were not as extreme as you (or others) would make them out to be. In feudal times, everyone still froze their relative asses off in winter. And the ""lords of the manor"" were only hurting themselves (and eventually killing themselves) if they attempted to starve their population of **serfs**. Besides, when the population demographics inverted after the plague (and happening in the next few decades w/o a plague) the tables got turned. >The middle class and our current income distribution is a huge historical anomaly. But mainly due to tapping a dense supply of energy, and even more due to the huge advances of technology and productivity. The luddite attitude actually serves the people on the TOP (in maintaining an establishment status quo) -- tech tends to serve the people on the bottom. The so called ""poor"" today -- provided they act and live in a financially *responsible* manner -- live a far better life now than in 1970; just as the poor in 1970 lived a much better life than those of 1930 (or 1890. 1850. 1810, etc). I really couldn't care less whether Warren Buffet craps on a gold-plated toilet seat -- or if Sergei Brin has a custom built yacht with a helipad -- neither of those make ME any less wealthy in real terms."
