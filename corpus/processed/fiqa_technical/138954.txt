"Plenty! Following are just a few: For things like RESP and RRSP which have an ""end"" date; as you or your children age, you should be migrating to less speculative investments and more secure ones. When children are young, for example, you might be in a ""growth"" type fund. Later on, you would likely want to switch that to an ""income"" fund, which is also more conservative and less likely to lose principal. Are you getting the best benefit from your credit cards? Is there another card with benefits that you would get more ""back"" from using? Is that fee-based Air miles card worth it? Is cash-back better for you? If you have regular investment withdrawals, can you increase them? Do you like the plan they are going in to? Similarly look over any other long-term debt repayment. Student loans, car loans, mortgage. What is coming up this year, what is ""ending"". If, for example, car payment will end, how will you earmark that money, so it just does not disappear into general funds. While you could go over things like these more often, once a year should be plenty often to keep tabs and not obsess. Good Luck!"
