"Since these are specific items that you don't really want to buy, it might help to figure out what you could spend that money on that you DO really want. It sounds like right now you are thinking ""Wow, I can get this widget (that I don't really want) for so cheap with this discount code!"" Try changing your thinking to something along the lines of ""This widget is pretty cool, but I could buy this doodad that I really want instead"" or ""This widget is nice, but if I don't buy it, I could have a latte every other day this month."" I've found this to be a very effective technique-- and I often don't end up buying the doodads or lattes either. It's just a good way to put the cost of your purchase in perspective. The other thing I do when I want something is to write it down and revisit it a week or so later. If I still want it and I still have the budget for it (and especially if I've skipped other purchases to save up for it), then I buy it. That advice doesn't sound like it will work for you though, since it sounds like you've wanted to buy these things for a long time. So.. are you REALLY sure you don't want them, or do you just not want to want them?"
