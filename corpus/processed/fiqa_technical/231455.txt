Maybe center-left or neoliberal would be a more appropriate term I just couldn't think of any left wing media atm. Anyway, Calling CNN left-wing wasn't irrelevant to my argument and it can be disregarded without interfering with what I'm trying to say. Do you have any actual criticisms of my argument or did you just comment to discredit me?
