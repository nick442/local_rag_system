Clearly the US isn't interested in prosecuting executives for criminal activity, and hasn't been for years. Rick Scott perpetrated the largest Medicare fraud in history, but he was never charged with a crime because his company (HCA Columbia) agreed to pay nearly a billion in fines. His lack of a criminal record and substantial net worth left him free to pursue other opportunities, like becoming the governor of Florida.
