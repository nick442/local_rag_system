I used to be a trader at a desk that sold delta-one derivatives on listed indices (think swaps, ETFs). There is a LOT to do: buy/ sell stocks according to redemptions or new orders; manage the currency exposure; indices rebalance their composition everyday based on stock corporate actions, dividends and index reviews - you need to be aware of each and everyone and rebalance your portfolio to account for it; manage your inventory to get the best repo rates possible; trade single stock swaps with foreign counterparties to get access to better tax rates on dividends; when you have a big order where certain stock orders may not get filled - you have to create a strategy for managing that risk; sometimes you hedge your positions using futures that expire every three months in which case you need to figure out the best times to roll your expiring futures; i could go on and on. Basically, since the profit margins are so low, the market so competitive for such vanilla products, and the volumes so high, you have to really make your processes super efficient and error-proof. Trust me, there is a lot to be done!
