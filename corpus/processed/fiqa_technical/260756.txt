Fundamentally, it's no different than normal. A risky entity must entice investors with higher interest rates than less risky entities. We're just in such a low interest rate environment that the rate spread now dips below zero and very low risk entities can issue debt with a negative coupon. Though I agree that this makes no sense and the world's gone mad.
