> Of course it is, but people can't live in 7.50 an hour anymore. So have 5000 people who would otherwise be on 7.50 an hour get 0 instead? The finance/economics aspect of this was clear from day one, and it's a no brainer that jobs will get cut even in a leftist city like Seattle. It's not a short term thing either - there's no reason for the long run equilibrium to be any different.
