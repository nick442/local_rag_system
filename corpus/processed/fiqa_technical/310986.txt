It's possible that a particular policy change would flip a company from profitable to unprofitable. It is even more likely that broader economic cycles put you out of business. Or a competitor gets a major business advantage. Or you make a bad management call. Our government is set up to encourage moderate decisions through majority rule. The president has a lot of power for one man, but without congress he's got real limits. Even with congress, the filibuster means that the minority has some real teeth against extreme bills. This idiot is saying hey we weathered 4 years and grew under Obama including 2 of a democrat majority congress, and the worst recession in 80 years, but ANOTHER 4 years, well we just don't know.
