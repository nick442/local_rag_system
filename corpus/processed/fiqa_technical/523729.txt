But by closing the short position the broker would still be purchasing shares from the market no? Or at least, someone would be purchasing the shares to close the short position. So, why doesn't the broker just let Client A keep their short position open and buy shares in the market so that Client B can sell them..I know it sounds a bit ridic, but not much more so to me than letting Client A borrow the shares to begin with!
