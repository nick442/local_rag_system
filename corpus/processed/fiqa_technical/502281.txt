As somebody that hasn't lived in areas where agriculture is present, I'm genuinely curious. Let's say I'm a recent high school graduate looking at jobs that are available to me. What room for advancement is there if I decide to start picking crops? Isn't that seasonal work? Could I count on a job that pays year round? My impression is that lots of labor is needed for short periods of time when it comes to picking crops but that the jobs are temporary, which I can't imagine makes them particularly attractive to potential hires.
