Unsure on your message. I like advertising if it gives me free websites - couldn't imagine a world where I have to pay to use Google and any website I may potentially be interested in looking at. If the alternative is to pay a subscription or not have the website, I'm simply not keen. I'll subscribe to some but I'm unable to subscribe to all. Internet is an education to me - if today I decide I'd wish to start a cinema and spend 6 hours researching how, it would be unrealistic to subscribe to each website I visited. Ultimately though I don't quite understand your response, but appreciate it nonetheless.
