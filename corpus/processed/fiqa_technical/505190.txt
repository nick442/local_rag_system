There are multiple strategies depending on the message you'd like to send. As far as shopping goes, you can: Claim the spouse will kill you if you buy another X. This works for either gender. Say that you are saving for some expensive vacation or other item. Go along but just seem lie nothing pleases you, be disinterested. The restaurant thing is tougher, and you might want to just avoid it. Key thing is to say you'd like to get together but after lunch, you don't want the friend(s) to think you are avoiding them. Good luck!
