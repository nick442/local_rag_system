"I could be wrong, but I do not think that's the actual question being argued or it wouldn't be at the SCOTUS. I believe the question is actually, is it a violation of ones first amendment rights to have to pay an organization that uses it's resources to support polical causes and ideals that you may not agree with. Regadless of what you feel about that statement, in my opinion, this suite like the ones before it are really only about money and politics. Companies can save money if there are weeker Unions and Democrats lose a strong power base. That's why there are groups like the freedom foundation. They don't actually care about protecting your free speech, they care about their ""doner's"" bottom line and idiology. PS - I'msure this is a shocker, but I will admit that I do have a bias in this argument. Although I am not and never have been a union member, I was raised comfortably on union salaries."
