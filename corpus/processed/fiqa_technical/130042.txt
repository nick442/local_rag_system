Rauner is just the latest version of people like Mitt Romney who think because they can run a business they can run the government, except worse because at least Romney wasn't a completely useless governor. All the financial acumen in the world doesn't count for shit in politics when no one likes you and you aren't interested in getting them to like you. Maybe it's stupid but that's democracy, unfortunately.
