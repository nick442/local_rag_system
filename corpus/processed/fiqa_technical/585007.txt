"WHY? I've bought most of my clothing from Bonobos for the last few years, I guess I'll look elsewhere now. > Partnering with Walmart — the biggest bricks-and-mortar retailer around — might have seemed extremely off brand for Bonobos. YES it is. And ""I think Walmart is misunderstood in some ways."" isn't an explanation. Bonobos and Walmart are totally different in my mind, I can't imagine I'm the only Bonobos customer disappointed by this change."
