> Then I'll pay for those services as I use them. Not before. except for the fact that you need them set up before you use them >It's not cheaper for me. I don't have kids, no public school. I work from home, no commuting. It's a lose/lose scenario for me. think about it as an investment in the future for when you do need it, and those kids skills. >I work for the government. Many of the government services are valuable. It's just seems more logical to pay for them as you use them, like every single other business works. good luck getting the cashflow with that sorta system to work >Even more reason to test the experiment. Let's give it a try and see what happens. I'm sure I'll be fine. the experiment was conducted for hundreds of years it didn't work so we changed it, and then it worked a lot better, if you try that experiment we know it was fail. >Actually you don't. You just want free shit like everyone else. honestly I do understand and I also believe in limits to what we expect the Gov to do, but the current rhetoric around it is just stupid, read Bill Clinton's last book it goes into a lot of detail around it. Now here is something I want you to think about. A truck causes 50X more damage to the roads than a car does, so according to you a truck should pay 50X the road tax of a car, now after this happens how much more will you be paying for your goods, but thats alright you save a little on your road tax.
