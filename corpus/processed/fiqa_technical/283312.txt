"The thing is, there's no such thing as luck. It simply doesn't exist. Random chance exists, but that's entirely not the same thing. What we call ""luck"" is merely the ability of being prepared for the time when something randomly good or bad happens to you. That's all. Nothing more, nothing less. There's nothing ""deserving"" about people that are paid well for being lucky. They are paid well because people with a demonstrated ability to take advantage of random events are valuable. Whether it's ""fair"" or not is beside the point. Indeed, there's no such thing as ""fair"", either, princess. Anyone that tells you otherwise is selling something."
