"Automation is an admirable goal, but I don't think we're going to see a world where there's no menial labor for a very long time. Coupled with that, there's pretty much no real way to look at a menial-style job and say, ""That deserves $15 an hour."" The two reasons above combine and make a strong argument for something like a basic income or _drastically_ expanded welfare and safety net programs. A further failing of the ""retrain everyone"" approach is assuming that everyone _can_ be retrained. There are, simply put, people that exist -- and will always exist -- that cannot do non-menial work, for a myriad of reasons."
