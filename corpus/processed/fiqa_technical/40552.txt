This is why a lot of the advice in this sub pisses me off: a lot of people in here would rather lie by obscurity than confronting issues head on to resolve them. Which I guess makes sense if you want to work your way into an obtuse, dishonest company culture (sometimes perceived as the only way to get a job to pay your bills). But I've been able to do pretty well by being honest. I don't think there is a need to buy into the bullshit. Edit: oops for some reason I thought I was in /r/jobs
