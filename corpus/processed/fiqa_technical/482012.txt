"But your idea of ""freedom"" comes with a lack of freedom that I see as being even worse. If a road is not profitable, it won't be built, right? So all of those roads in the country, that go up mountains, that I love to travel on won't exist? These corporations have the right to decide who gets to use the roads, right? You're all about the free market, but what if the guy who owns the road to my house jacks up the price or does a crappy job maintaining it? I just have to move? It will also be for-profit, which means it will cost more. You're willing to pay more to use a road because it's your choice as opposed to less for that road because someone made you pay for it? So it sounds like you're willing to accept a much worse situation just because it's your choice, and not actually because it's better. Are there any concrete advantages other than choice?"
