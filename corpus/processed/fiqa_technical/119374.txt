Except, restricting how the economy can be controlled is a slippery slope into financial control of the nation by outside interests. The real issue is that every extreme becomes a problem, and trying to block every extreme is futile. Controls should impede, but not completely stop, extremes. The impedance method should return the force against it as support or growth for the nation. Financial growth of any outside interest connected to the government or in this country should bring more and more wealth into the nation, while slowing the growth of the financial extremes, but never stopping it. Special Interest groups need to return to the country a share of what they gain through their work with the government and our people. Religious groups should return money and support of the lower class. Women’s advocacy groups need to return value for their gains. The NRA needs to return value for its gains. The poorer populace should return work for the country in return for education, health care, housing, food, and wages. Harder and smarter work, better progress through education, should be rewarded with better benefits and eventual financial “freedom” (there is no true freedom in a world of limited resources and competition, so the idea of “true freedom” is ridiculous). We should, however, endeavor to give as much freedom as possible. There should be an uncomfortable minimum below which a person may only fall if they refuse to work and get educated.
