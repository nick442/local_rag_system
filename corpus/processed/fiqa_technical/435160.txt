Financial analysis and modeling. What I find intimidating about CFA Level 1 is not the difficulty level, but the size. As I mentioned above, it's most likely that I will be asked questions on the principles of accounting, financial statement analysis. Unfortunately, my knowledge of these is rather limited. Do you consider CFA level 1 curriculum materials to be a good resource for learning that?
