"It's not something for nothing. If people need healthcare or shelter at a particular time in their life, you give it to them because they are human - that's something. Our current system doesn't properly reward ""something"" anyway. Some of the hardest workers in the economy get virtually nothing for their labour while others are rewarded excessively for making little contribution simply because they handle money and supposedly have more responsibility. You're assuming market based reward is fair and just. It's not. Redistribution is necessary to create a better society."
