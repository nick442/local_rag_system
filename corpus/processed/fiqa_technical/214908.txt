Better off making sure what ever degree you pursue has real life applications commensurate with what ever income level you hope to achieve. Most of the tech giants got really lucky being young and innovative when tech really took off at the consumer level in the early 90's. That ship has sailed for most of the lucky billionaires because now everyone with brain and commitment can write code if they want to. It's not nearly as valuable. I'm not saying you can't get rich as a dropout if you're really lucky, but I can play those same odds with a lotto ticket.
