I'd start paying off the smallest balance first. Hopefully, that can get cleared in a few months. When that happens, close the account and try to get your bank loan again. Keep repeating this process until either you pay off all of the debt. After you've paid off one or two loans and put the negative marks of your credit history further into the past, you'll be able to make better progress.
