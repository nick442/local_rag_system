Agreed. I travel 8-10 weeks a year and usually my option for a private room in a shared home on airbnb is the same as a room at a mid-tier hotel. Whole house on airbnb is equivalent to a room at a higher tier hotel. I'll take the hotel 9 times out of 10 to get the points and because I know what I'm getting each time.
