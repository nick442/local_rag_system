">Yeah, that's Obama and the economy alright. Not just regular ""being burnt out"". Making room for motivated young entrepreneurs and small business owners is such a horrible thing. Mostly related to compressed margins, but in a down economy it's even worse without adding extra liabilities. Some have been doing it for decades, admittedly with higher profit, but as the incentives to continue become less and less, its not completely being burnt out, its like if gas became 50% of your net salary. Why even go to work? It costs half your income just to GET to work. >Making room for motivated young entrepreneurs and small business owners is such a horrible thing. Well they have a ton of ""for lease"" warehouse space and thousand and thousands of empty storefronts to choose from. Room is not the issue. Successful business plans that can flourish and actually produce something is the issue. >I imagine you're seeing this trend with young business owners too right? No, I see young business owners mostly failing, they know they want to start a company but their understanding of details can often be limited. Desire is only part of the picture, you must also have discipline, sacrafice and determination. Some people do and can have those things, but most dont. >People are still starting businesses, being profitable and succeeding? Oh well, the government is still around to blame! Fewer and fewer. Want to open a competitor to best buy? Good luck. Want to open a competitor to amazon? You're about 10-15 years behind. Most companies produce nothing tangible and you can only make so much money making custom t-shirts. >Oh well, the government is still around to blame! I prefer to put my faith in people who know what they're doing and have been proven successful over decades. Not the government administration du jour who is gone in a few years whilst a new one comes in with entirely new policies."
