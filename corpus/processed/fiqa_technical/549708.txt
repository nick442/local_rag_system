If it were possible for every person in the world to run their own business at the same time maybe you'd have a point, but that's not how things work. As it stands now there inherently must be more employees than business owners and the nature of that relationship inherently favours the owner. A few laws in place to somewhat balance the scales is not a bad thing. At the end of the day, the employer was breaking the law and now they have to suffer the consequences.
