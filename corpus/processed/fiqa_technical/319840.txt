And this distinction is a HUGE difference. Both for the employees and the corporate. Even though the article doesn't say if all the franchises decided to kept all the employees who used to work for the corporate (few months down the road), as someone who have worked in the franchise business (not burger king) at different level, I will bet my money that a lot of them lost their job. The whole reason why BK sold them off as franchises because as a corporate they couldn't maintain the overhead and since fast food businesses has ridiculously low margin, I wouldn't be surprised to maintain profitability the franchise owners got rid of a lot of them. So its not too far off to say that all these people were fired by corporate but the franchise owners decided to keep (probably) most of them out of convenience for the short term but probably lost the job few months down the road.
