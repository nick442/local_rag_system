There was one nugget in this pretty bad article. Lowering taxes on the investor class - specifically on capital capital gains does not in itself spur investment if there is not growth in the overall economy. What it does do is spur short term speculation since capital gains taxes are only levied on the sale - it's cheaper to buy/sell, buy/sell, etc.
