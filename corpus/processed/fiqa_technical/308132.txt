It really depends on your usage. I multitask somewhat heavily, and I often can't even switch back and forth between two apps without it having to reload one of them and wiping the state (ie I have to navigate back through the app again to get where I was). This is especially annoying with things that are network dependent. I'm running a custom ROM that has helped a lot, but it's still noticeably worse than my Evo 3D even though both have 1GB of RAM.
