The reason we are talking about Saudi, because they are the biggest oil exporter. Their political stability-oil supply has direct impact to US and global economy. i doubt any of us really concern about actual saudi economic well being without considering direct impact to global oil supply. Venezuela oil export is not as large as Saudi, and venezuela biggest customer (and their biggest mistake) is US. Venezuela is just US screwing a vassal state. Saudi is global oil security.
