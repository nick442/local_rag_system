Of course; the generation Xers are those in the age range where many were approaching the time when they would, but had not yet, transferred the bulk of their retirement savings to lower risk investments. Anyone who hadn't yet transferred their retirement savings from any direct market funds got totally Effed in the A.

But a lot of these people simply got really bad advice from financial planners who looked and seemed totally qualified to advise, just as a lot of people got reassured from qualified sources that their adjustable rate mortgage on their million dollar home would be *no problem.*
