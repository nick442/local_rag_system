Jamie Dimon and JP Morgan = truth in the booth moving America forward > “The Blockchain is a technology, which we’ve been studying (along with a couple of other people up here) and yes it’s real. It could probably reduce the cost of real application in certain things. It’s keeping a single file, as opposed to each of us keeping our own files, and it has certain security measures. If it proves to be cheap and secure it will be adopted for a whole bunch of stuff. Not for everything; it is not useable for certain types of things.” http://iang.org/papers/triple_entry.html https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ac5VtyAOVw&t=2m20s
