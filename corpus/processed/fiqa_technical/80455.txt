"That's interesting, I didn't know that. I'm in the sales/marketing field myself, so this is a very strange idea to me. It seems like this could help contribute to their problems though..I'd like to think that I'm a relatively intelligent and successful individual, and I would hate the prospect of entering an environment like that. Don't get me wrong, a job at MSFT is still a job at MSFT. There are few companies that can offer their level of job security. But, to know that no matter how much of an asset I'd make myself, that I'm just ""climbing"" a rigid ladder..that's a bit rough. Obviously, you always have to work your way up any where, but I could see how that might turn away motivated and ambitious talent."
