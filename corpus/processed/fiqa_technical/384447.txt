It does raise a valid point : being a doctor is a mater of studying , and can be done by anyone wiling to put in the effort , much like any profession or craft. And there are many medschools globally that take in people who weren't qualified enough to study medicine in their own country, yet after graduation from said medschools they go back to work in their home country like any other doctor who studied there . so really , since being a doctor is a matter of learning and experience , rather than innate talent , are doctors overpaid ?
