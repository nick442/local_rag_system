I suspect the real problem is that the stagnation of middle-class salaries vs. Lego being something of a premium (though worth it!) toy. Add in that Millennials are waiting longer to form long-term relationships and the dropping birth rate (at least in the US).. The durability factor surely doesn't help - folks more likely to pass down their own kits instead of buying more, and I'm guessing there's a thriving lego market on eBay as well? Figure all the above together are the problem.
