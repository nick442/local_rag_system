I suspect you were downvoted because you wanted to increase the size of the pie rather than argue about what percentage of it everyone gets. And the Fed is a bigger perp today than energy for wealth inequality. Wealth creation is a far more sustainable and commonsense way to create value for the individual. Lower energy = more wealth freed up for other things. The 1970's were the beginning of the totalitarian seizure of many areas of our economy by central planners- education, healthcare. Yes fossil fuels accelerated on their exponential cost curve but the big impacts came from gov't.
