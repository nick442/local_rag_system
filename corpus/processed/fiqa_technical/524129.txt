What people don't realize is that in many EU countries, you pay a per minute fee (even when on hold) when you call a support line. Your printer broke and you need to call in for a warranty repair? That will be 15 cents a minute. They usually cap the maximum charge but it's often not free to call. In The Netherlands, it's almost never free. Also, when you buy something and it breaks under warranty, you generally can't return it to a store and they give you a new one. Instead they ship it out for repairs. I bought a new coffee machine in Germany for 80 euros. It broke 3 days later and when I brought it back, they shipped it out for repairs and I had no coffee machine for a week.
