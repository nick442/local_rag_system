First of all, I've been out of college for over a decade, so good job on the assumptions. /s Secondly, when calculating capital gains, you have to take into account the depreciation of the asset. As you would have it, a house owned for 20 years would be fully depreciated, and so no capital gains would apply to such a case. But don't let facts or knowledge get in the way of your trolling, please.
