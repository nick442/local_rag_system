"You need a brokerage account to invest in ETFs (there are many different kinds of ETFs, not just one) and that usually means having some amount already deposited with them into the ""cash account"" in your name. Once the brokerage account is established, you can send whatever money from each paycheck to the brokerage and tell them to invest it in the ETF of your choice. There are no restrictions as to how much money you can send if you send them a check. If you want the money to be withheld from your paycheck, then of course, the limit is the amount of the take-home pay, and whether your employer offers such a service will affect the issue. If you are wanting to invest in ETFs through your employer's 401(k) plan (or 403(b) plan), there are lots of other considerations."
