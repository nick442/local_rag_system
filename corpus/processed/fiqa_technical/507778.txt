I'm not here to call anyone fake news..but I have a question for you: What leads you believe Mediabiasfactcheck.com is a reliable source on this topic, enough to use it as a source to justify your claims? > **Disclaimer**: The methodology used by Media Bias Fact Check is our own. It is not a tested scientific method. It is meant as a simple guide for people to get an idea of a sourceâ€™s bias. It's not an organization or a research group: it's a website run by a single person who is the sole judge of all criteria necessary in determining how biased a media source is.
