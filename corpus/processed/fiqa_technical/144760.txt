(Sourced from my rectum.) A good salesman doesn't just sell software, they sell themselves, more specifically, they sell themselves to the company. They will sell the company they are with that they are worth it, and that they should be compensated appropriately. If the programmers had the same savvy in the same nature, odds are they wouldn't be making the program, but, the company would likely note their ability to sell themselves, and prefer them on the sales team. Sure, without the programmers, they wouldn't have as much to sell, but, the right salesman would be able to pull in more profit for the company than having the right product would.
