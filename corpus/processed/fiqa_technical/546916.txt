Let me opt out of the parts I don't want to pay for, then. I'll gladly not pay for Social Security, Medicare/Medicaid, Welfare, Unemployment, etc. and not receive the benefits, for starters! I'm not costing the government anything by existing here and doing business with people. In fact, I'm paying taxes indirectly for services I'm not receiving.
