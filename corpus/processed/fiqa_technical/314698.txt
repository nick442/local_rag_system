"I was the one who made the beating you to the punch comment. That liquidity is worthless without an active market. That's the whole point of liquidity. An ability to sell back when needed. High volume means nothing when the fucking HFT buys all the stock and holds you hostage to his sell price. The only thing raising the price of pineapples is high speed trading. They only buy OR sell **when they see a bid.** That is not a traditional market maker. Please, tell me how that is wrong. That is not a rhetorical question. edit: If a pineapple is listed at 6.00 let's say you decide to buy and throw it in your cart. A store employee overhears you saying ""I'd be willing to pay 6.02 for this"". The employee tells the cashier to raise the price to 6.02 right before you get to the register. This is HFT in a nutshell. It doesn't provide an active pineapple market because the pineapple was only being offered once a buyer was lined up."
