From the headline I thought it was a nanny-state idea to stop people eating too much junk food, but no, it's just a desperate attempt to ameliorate one of the consequences of a mismanaged (ie centrally controlled) economy. You would think we wouldn't have to keep making the same mistakes, but apparently humans are not good at learning from history (let alone following ideas through to their logical conclusion).
