>so I am unsure of whether or not re-selling other supplier’s inventory without their consent is legal You shouldn't wait to find out after you start making sales. >Is using generic names for sale a workaround for selling inventory without their consent? That sounds like an issue concerning skirting around unauthorized resale of merchandise issues. If you're concerned that buying a company's product from a Canadian distributor might not be authorized for resale in the United States, you should first ask the reseller and then ask the Company if not provided with a satisfactory answer. *Not* getting that answer beforehand could be disastrous. Generally speaking however, let's assume you've got your logistics figured out. You need to find a specialized need in the market that bigger suppliers can't meet. If Staples is selling bulk plain/recyclable paper to get people in the door—you're never going to compete with them. You have to look for areas where companies like that can't compete. For example, a Martin Luther King Jr. Day themed line of stationary would be something you'd never find at Staples, but some people would buy in a heart beat. The trick is to find the *biggest* types of these ignored segments of buyers not addressed by larger players—and start inching your way into the market. First step is to find your niche(s) and supply. This will probably be a balancing act, in that many suppliers will could give you good rates but not have the products you need. The second step, if you're selling online, is to develop effective digital marketing strategy to target your niche's keywords.
