My first thought when I go into McD, JitB, and Carls, they have way too much stuff on the menu to be able to prepare well without it all being pre-cooked microwaveable crap. When you go to some place like In and Out and the have same number of people in the kitchen (or more), roughly the same size kitchen and they only make 3 things (burgers. fries, shakes). If McD and company are not doing it the way they do at In and Out, why would you want a hamburger from them?
