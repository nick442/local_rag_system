~~Dividends~~ edit: Sorry; misunderstood your question. Subsidiary losses. If NI is -$1000 and you own 80%, then your adjustment for year 20XX is $-200. If the accumulated minority interest is <$200, the end balance of non-controlling interest at 20XX+1 would be negative. I can also imagine a scenario due to negative value of the sub's net identifiable assets using partial goodwill method.
