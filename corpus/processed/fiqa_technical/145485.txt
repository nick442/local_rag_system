You had excellent point how **costs of production** can affect price. Final_J explained already how value differs from this. It's good to remember that cost, price and value are separate things. Usually cost < price < value for trade to happen. Money is the best metrics we have, but it doesn't give really good picture of neither, costs or value. I really kept myself as a smart dude about a year ago, for understanding what you just told us here. I like the way you think.
