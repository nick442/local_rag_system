I think a lot of people should just forego college altogether. To be clear, there are lots of valuable degrees out there. We can also always use some English and history majors, but we should make sure we get just enough to satisfy the demand. We wouldn't have engineers who could communicate without English majors who become teachers to them. But we have far too many people blindly picking majors and then realizing they are competing with a million others for a handful of available jobs.
