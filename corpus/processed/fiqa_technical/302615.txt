"I feel like he's just doing this for the kicks and doesn't really believe in it. But then I see the numerous talks, the book etc and I can't decide. His entire basis for a ""idea meritocracy"" is that everyone should be truthful or ""radical transparency"". I do not see the connection at all. You cannot build an idea meritocracy because it inherently means you can judge if an idea succeeds or fails before implementing it. If you want to bias yourself toward successful ideas, it requires nothing more than allowing people to implement what they think and then rewarding the ones who succeed. Basically, I cannot see the point of this ""radical transparency"" etc. Except for one possibility - his computer algorithm. I feel like that is his grasp at immortality and the algorithm requires stupid tons of data to function. So why not give it to the best source for such data? Top ivy league graduates and brilliant people hired by the one of the biggest hedge funds on the planet. And then sell them on this idea that ""radical transparency"" is the basis for all success in the firm, and ask them to start inputting data on it."
