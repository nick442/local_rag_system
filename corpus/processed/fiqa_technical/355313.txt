>Like I said they are a media company. And, a broadcast company with several channels, don't forget that part that makes you totally wrong. >Even tho you have not. You actually barely done any such thing. No, I have repeatedly acknowledged their faults, you disagreed with the extent of my acknowledgement. Frankly, this is the sort of behavior I expect out of a petulant or severely autistic child. You do not tolerate anyone else having an opinion. >You seem to have a habit of making assumptions and bullshit claims, should really address that. My sampling is far from limited here. I know enough to say with absolute certainty Vice journalism is on par of Buzzfeed, and has a noticeable liberal bias. If I wanted fluff pieces to read I would go to Vice and that matter Buzzfeed. But if I want actual investigative journalism I go elsewhere. Buzzfeed's scoops are about stars dating each other, political stories, etc. Vice does pieces on buying nukes on the black market, the inside tour of North Korea (you know that claim that they have the same fat kid and fake grocery stores full of fake food? That's from Vice's investigative journalism), etc. If you can't distinguish between the two, I think you're ironically making assumptions and bullshit claims. Oh, and about your sampling, you're continuing to justify a sweeping generalization which you don't even recognize as fallacious. Do you not understand that your derivative argument is faulty? That you are making a notorious mistake that is well-documented in logical academia? >lol. Your analysis is no more subjective than mine is. Claiming your analysis is objective is outright laughable. I am judging quality by the story on its own merits: that's objectivity. You are judging the quality of a story by your negative opinion of the producer and publisher's reputation: that's subjectivity. It makes you subjectively dismissive of my objective analysis. Your analytical skills are outright laughable.
