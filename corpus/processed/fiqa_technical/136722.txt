"It's sad just how uninformed most of us are be default. Even a Google search of most politicians will only bring up a barebones summary and a bunch of opinion. Personally, I just can't spend the time each election to figure out what the actual nature of the folks running might be. Stress from work needs alleviation or I'll break down, normal life stuff takes over most of the time, and at the end of each day if I try and do any political research I'll just fall asleep with it on my phone's browser read half-way through. It's impossible to look at every decision someone has made and figure out the reason *without* a swarm of editorials, so if their opponents want to wave a few ""flip flops"" around I'd have *no* way of reliably working the truth from the lies. Not to mention that Google et all filter my results, so anything positive about people I don't like and criticism of people I do like is buried beneath stuff that affirms my bias. In the end, it's a mess that makes it impossible for me to do a damn thing if I wish to be a responsible voter, so I just don't vote. This leaves the polls to those who vote with their hearts closed and wallets own."
