Right there with you. It drives me crazy watching those commercials with the cute talking babies telling the average person they can take control of their own future and open a trading account. A few months ago I met someone at a bar who worked customer support for a large company with lots of individual traders. I asked him what percentage of his client accounts actually made money and he guessed only a few. The company got paid either way (commissions). What a scam.
