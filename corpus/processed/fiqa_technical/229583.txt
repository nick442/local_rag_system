"So the ""Win state"" for the America is that Trump made up a nick name. I really don't think Trump is going to win that game because the come backs could range from Retard to PePe to OrangeMan and they are all good and true and hit home hard in the way that makes America cringe. Unfortunately the truth is its is more a sign of American impotence and frustration as its power and influence wane and the world has stopped responding to the baby talk that led us into the Iraq war and Afghanistan. Now only America responds to the baby talk and the world looks on in wonder as if the Chinese did actually manage to contaminate our diet with excess lead. There is nothing that anyone is going to do about North Korea, there is no solution except to accept another member into the nuclear club, and hope others don't rapidly follow suit. The more aggressive and abrasive the US acts, the more the motivation for others to do the same. There will be a price to pay for the name calling and it will last a lot longer that the orange baboons antics in front of un-amused world leaders."
