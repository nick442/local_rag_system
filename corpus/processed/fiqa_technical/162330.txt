"**Put aside the politics?** That's laughable for an article that is nothing BUT politics. For starters the artificially false conflation of *everyone* as if their behavior were homogeneous, when in reality it is a full spectrum (there are many people with not only ZERO debt, but substantial assets, including very productive assets). Ergo the argument that there is some egalitarian ""solution"" to this by treating everyone the same way.. is in fact a POLITICAL assumption (and a very biased one at that)."
