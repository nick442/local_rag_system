Depends.. The pricing models for exotics imo are decent because there is no alternative. So if you going to be trading exotics then you might as well go by these models. The desk VaR models aren't too bad either as long (a) Your portfolio is small (b) There aren't too many idiosyncratic factors. I view quantitative risk management models like the models predicting the weather. You know that your model will work 80% of the time, especially on mundane stuff like temperature, cloudiness, etc. However, the 5% of the time, like predicting hurricanes, your model is going to be only a very rough guess. So you should not rely on models to save you from a crisis, which exactly the opposite of what the suits and the Feds think.
