Yep, basically no loans for me for at least two years and new credit cards are at a higher interest rate then I'm comfortable with. That's fine. I have two cars that are fully paid for, just paid off one credit card last week and will have the other one paid off before the end of the year. And I have a savings account with a positive balance. All of this happened by moving to a different house where my rent is $1,500 per month cheaper than I was paying on a house.
