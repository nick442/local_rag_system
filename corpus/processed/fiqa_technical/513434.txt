You can't include cellular and satellite, the speeds aren't comparable. These figures are from from: http://broadband.about.com/od/speedissues/a/Broadband-Internet-Speeds-Explained.htm and using http://www.checkyourmath.com/convert/data_rates/per_second/gigabits_kilobytes_per_second.php but translated into gigabits per second Broadband Technology Speed Gbps Dial-up 0.000052154 DSL 0.006144 - .006 Satellite 0.0032 - .002 3G 0.0004 - .0015 Cable Modem 0.001 - 1.0 WiMax less than 0.128 Fiber up to 1.0 4G / LTE up to 0.01 As you can see from this table, there is broad range within the technologies. A low end cable modem is worse than Satellite. With comcast, i get around 40mps, which is .04 on the table, which is better than the theoretical maximum of DSL by a huge factor. Edit: I have to hand it to comcast, 40 mps is much better than the 20 mps it was 2 years ago. I just feel like the pricing model is a license to print money.
