<notahipster> We don't have a tv but we watch shows on Netflix. /notahipster That said, I loved the VW commercials that came out about ten years ago. I have vw turbo now and I love it. Coincidence? If commercials didn't need to relate to the lowest common denominator, a lot more of them might be interesting.
