"Actuaries make serious bank. If you're good at math and statistics then that is the path my young padawan. I feel you, got my BS in Econ before getting MBA and CFA because the degree is ""worthless"" from a job perspective. Invaluable from a life perspective though. Still my favorite subject, I miss econ but no way I wanted to get the PhD necessary to do anything with it. Sorry for the digression. CFA L3 (even L2) â‰¥ MFin and a lot cheaper/faster if you are smart and can handle studying on your own. edit: I have friends in corp finance, they are miserable. If you feel under appreciated now then you probably will in that field as well. Lots of long hours of modelling and template whoring. Upside is that it is better security than most financial positions."
