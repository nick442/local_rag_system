"As you use the equations do you stop and ask, ""Why is this option better than using something else?"" In physics I have to do this all the time. Two different equations can give the same solution, or something similar, but along with the solution one may give interesting output along the way and the other may give no meaningful output other than the solution. A physics example to highlight my point: do I want to use sin(x) or the series expansion of sin(x)? I apologize in advance for my ignorance if this follow up questions is not applicable."
