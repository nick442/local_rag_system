"I don't want to sue them on my own. I don't want them sued in the first place. Anyone could see that this was a typical class-action suit with minimal merits that companies usually just pay off to make go away. Fucking ambulance chasing lawyers are fucking us all over, and those idiots like yourself who cover up for them. If only the judges would get some balls and say, ""Hey, this so called 'settlement' doesn't benefit the class at all and is basically a payoff for the scum sucking lawyers, so I'm going to deny it"". Good luck with that happening."
