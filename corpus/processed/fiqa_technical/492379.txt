I'm not sure where you are from, but I'm American. I believe strongly that people should have the right to do whatever the hell they want with their body, money, etc. unless it infringes upon the rights of others. If people don't want to pay for roads because the use of the roads is not worth it to them, then they shouldn't have to because the government forces them through taxes. Having the freedom to make a decision is always better in my mind.
