If you're fiscally responsible, go ahead and use a megabank. Honestly, in all of the horror story experiences I've seen where someone went into honest details, they were trying to skate by with pointlessly risky decisions at the extreme bottom end of the financial spectrum. Nearly all of the complaints boil down to overdraft fees for people who run their account down to less than $10 and then get upset when something unexpected happens. For example, when banks re-order purchases from largest to smallest, so that users would have to pay a larger quantity of overdraft fees..that can literally only happen if you've tried to spend more than you have in the account. It's mathematically not possible for that to happen any other way. So yes, I think everyone can agree re-ordering is shitty, but those overdrafts are also 100% preventable by *not trying to spend more than you have*. Most people just want to jump on the gripe train, and they aren't going to share the real details of their situation, if they even understand them.
