Where do you draw this line.. isnt it lucky that you simply survived child birth? Arent we all lucky that an extention level event hasnt occured on earth? Arent you lucky that a specific sperm fertilized the egg that created you out of thousamds of others? Luck in the manner being described is typically held for scenarios that are all or mostly luck. Since it takes much more than ONLY luck for economic success - luck is not the only factor that plays a role. It is really that simple.
