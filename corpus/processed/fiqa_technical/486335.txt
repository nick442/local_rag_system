Call the credit card company you used to fund the account and file claims against each transaction used to top up the entropay account. File it either as merchandise not received, or in your case it sounds like unauthorized transaction would be appropriate as well. Your (real) credit card company will lodge the dispute and get your money back, usually will credit your account back within a couple of days. Be sure to follow up with your credit card company, as they usually send you some forms to fill out and sign before they finalize the claim.
