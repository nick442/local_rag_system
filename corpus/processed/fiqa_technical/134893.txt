Those are valid, but I think you will see banks move into fintech, as they already have, and they are also moving into blockchain. One thing that banks have, is money, and that allows them to move into new spaces in the economy even if they are late to the party. When you have institutions that have been around for more than a century, they don’t just go away. I think you start to see trading revenue comeback, eventually. The passive versus active investing is a cycle. As more and more people jump into passive investments, it will inevitably change the market because suddenly everything becomes more correlated. Once there is enough volatility to scare people out of their passive investments, then the indices are going to fall. Then you’ll start seeing how active investing is better and people start to move back. Passive investing is good when everything is up, but on the downside active investing (if you have the right managers) will outperform. Once this occurs, you will start to see more volatility in the markets again, and a return to active management, until inevitably people start to move back to passive again.
