If I am interpreting the information in your post correctly, then you are completely correct that NYCERS is by no means worth it--there is no dilemma here. In fact, I think NYCERS a worse deal than you are giving it credit for. NYCERS contribution costs you 6.2% of your TOTAL income because of the tax implication. The value of contributing to it is only the difference between what you can earn there and what you would earn in your 403(b). It's not clear whether that is even a positive number. Even if it is, it is only some small percentage times your contribution amount, which is 4.5% of your total income. The benefit of contributing to NYCERS is minuscule or even nonexistent. There is no way on earth that it makes up for your tax loss. Remember, the 5% interest you get in NYCERS (is that annually or total?) is compensation for the time value of money. It's not as valuable as an immediate 5% gain on your contributions and nothing near as valuable as a 5% increase in your income. If you keep your money out of NYCERS then you can earn capital gains on it elsewhere, like in your 403(b) or in an IRA. When it comes to investing, legally avoiding taxes is pretty much always top priority. Choosing among investments is also important, but not nearly as much. In your case the answer seems quite clear. Stop contributing to NYCERS immediately.
