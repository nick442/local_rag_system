I mean I have no criminal record, I don't do drugs, and I'm a stand up employee (no missed days, no write ups, outstanding on every review) but they did do a Credit check. I have a bankruptcy on my report from a couple years ago, but I'm not going to have a job dealing with money, so I'm not sure they'll even look at mine. Maybe it's just a universal thing? Should I just tell me boss that I accepted an offer and to expect their call, however I'm NOT putting in a notice at this time?
