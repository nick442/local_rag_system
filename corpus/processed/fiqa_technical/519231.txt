"It depends on whether the loan is written as a non-recourse debt and what collateral was pledged. ""Non-recourse"" debt means that the issuer is limited to seizing the pledged collateral but cannot extend beyond those pledged assets. A ""recourse debt"" allows the issuer to seize the collateral and potentially other assets of those signed to the loan. In your example, a non-recourse loan would stop the issuer at seizing the property pledged as collateral (for instance the land remaining after the golden condor took your house), and it would stop there if that was the entirety of the collateral pledged. In the case of a recourse debt, each of you who signed loan are most likely going to be held responsible for the rest of the debt. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonrecourse_debt http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recourse_debt"
