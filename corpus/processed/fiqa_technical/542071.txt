"Industry hates: The mandate to consider ""natural"" nitrites as not nitrites. The mandate to label many ingredients as ""natural flavors,"" rather than what they are. Many deceptive standards of identity, which are often out-dated. Mandated serving sizes, based on out-dated census information. And so on, and so on, and so on. You're making assumptions based on how you feel. I'm making accurate statements based on over a decade in the industry."
