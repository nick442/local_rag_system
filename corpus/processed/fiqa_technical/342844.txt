This is a great response, thanks. I appreciate Dale Carnegie, Sun Tzu etc, but after reading them I felt they didn't offer anything really specific towards running a business. I've just ordered the personal MBA after reading a bit more on it so thanks for that too. Prince2 methodology looks pretty in depth so that's going on the the 'later' pile for now!
