"From the Op's comment below re: the ""audit"" http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d11696.pdf, the first paragraph states that loans outstanding peaked at just over 1 trillion in 2008. So you'd look at the Fed's balance sheet of loans outstanding over time, and perhaps subtract amounts reported as more normal operations."
