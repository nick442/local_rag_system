"Rational in the economics context means making expected utility maximizing decisions with known information. That's it. See those red berries? You were hungry and rational, so you ate them. Turns out they're poisonous. Now you're dying. Still rational. Footnote implication: unless you're already doing it, the phrase ""I'd rather be [fishing]"" is necessarily untrue. That you're not, means that you'd rather be doing what you're doing."
