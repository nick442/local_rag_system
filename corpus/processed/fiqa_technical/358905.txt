Oh Yay! . what a recovery, was not AIG the insurance company that was left holding its own dick when the whole world defaulted in 2008. If memory serves, it was unable to pay out on all those credit default claims and had to get a massive bail out just to keep the banking system from imploding. The Fed must have bought a shit load of crap from them. Ah . .October cometh and the Great Unwind . . we cannot very well rate a Systemic Risk AAA now can me. Smart move gramma . .nice try . . . didn't fly
