"Interesting point to raise; but lacking in background.. the condition is [self-inflicted](https://www.forbes.com/2009/08/25/american-medical-association-opinions-columnists-shikha-dalmia.html); and we've known that for some time. Immigration has been a life-line here; but anti-trust action is what's needed more than immigration policy. But to paint immigrant doctors as ""injecting fragility and dependency into [our] healthcare system"" is misleading; it's more a blood donation keeping us alive while we figure out how to recoup our bone marrow.. stopping the blood donation won't cure the marrow; it will just make everything worse until that root cause is addressed."
