I took the Greyhound home for Thanksgiving. It would normally be a 9 hour drive, but with stops the bus trip ended up being 13. There was more legroom than an airplane and the tickets cost less than gas would have, but my favorite part was the scheduling. I was able to work Wednesday and take an overnight bus. I actually slept pretty well during the 4-hour stretches between stations (I brought a flask full of scotch to make sure). Unfortunately, they kick you off the bus and make you wait for an hour in the loud, brightly-lit stations while they gas up / change drivers. On the way back, I got to hang out all the way through Sunday and still made it to work Monday morning. Overall, a much better experience than I was expecting.
