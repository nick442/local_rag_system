How many ways must I point out that though the classical methods accomplish a lot, they are failing now? The embrace of Capitalism has reached the point where the failings become much more obvious. This doesn’t mean we throw out the whole thing because part of the model doesn’t work. Which, by the way, also seems to be the popular response lately! “Part of it doesn’t work? Throw the whole damn thing out!” Surely the fact that this issue is such a sensitive and popular topic points to real issues that haven’t been addressed, yes? So the current system IS NOT working as we’d like. No matter how much data you gather, if the information fails to account for the situation we are observing (our unrest, income inequality issues, falling labor worth, rising cost of living), then data is incorrect for the full situation. If the system refuses to recognized data due to police rival or religious beliefs, or any other ideaology, the system is now at fault for putting the ideaology above reality. And I have not rebutted anything I felt was fine. Why would I? Do you think I disagree with every point you make? Should I?
