This is just the latest.. http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/02/16/samsung-boss-arrested-in-south-koreas-explosive-corruption-scandal/ The Samsung CEO, several years ago, was convicted of tax fraud involving millions of dollars. He bribed the system by giving money to South Korea's International Olympic Commission. In return, the judges in S. Korea forgave him and placed him on their board of the IOC. Samsung is not a corporation in the traditional sense. They are run like a monarchy. The corporate management is being handed down from Father to Son. Rotten to the core.
