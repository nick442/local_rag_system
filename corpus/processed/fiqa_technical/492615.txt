The most depressing here in the UK is that several different think tanks have come out and categorically said that the by far the most effective tax policy is a very simple flat tax rate and high personal allowance (i.e. the threshold before you get taxed). Getting rid of all the tax allowances and other complication would massively streamline the system and there would be huge savings. The system would be fairer and would generate more cash. However, this will never happen because it will perceived as tax break on the rich, when in reality it would be a tax increase because of the lack of tax breaks.
