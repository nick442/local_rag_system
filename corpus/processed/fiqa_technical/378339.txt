Even though you can't find a job for a broadcast tech degree, you can find other jobs that suit you out of that field. A degree isn't the only thing that makes your job potential, experience, networking, certifications, and accomplishments do. You're smart enough to get a B.S. That's something most people can't do. You can go back to school and pursue another degree with a higher market value, learn a trade, find friends that can connect you in their field. I believe in ya bro.
