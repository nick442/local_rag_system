I'm not in the industry, but the point of the quoted section suggests that hybrid debt (instruments with both debt and equity features) count as acceptable capital against upcoming required capital positions. These instruments are going to be cheaper than using common equity, and provide a leverage effect that can improve the return on equity (same income/cash flow over lower required equity).
