Eh. The valuations are extrapolations based on the value of equity with liquidation rights. Which is fine: if I'm a buyer of that class, I don't really care what the value of common is; I care what the value of that class of equity is. Bloomberg tries to paint that as some conspiracy, which is ridiculous.
