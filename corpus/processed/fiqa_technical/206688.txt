She was there for 5 years. Someone brought in to sell the company is going to do it in 12-18 months, 24 max. She is probably a good #2 but not CEO material. There are many people like that who need some direction from the person above them but aren't good actually being the top person. I'd blame the board for not realizing this as much as I'd blame her.
