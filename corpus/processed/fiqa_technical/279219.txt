There's never been a good micropayment system on the internet. Credit card and paypal transaction costs are too high, and the whole thing takes too long. The hassle of a credit card transaction only makes sense if you are making a major (5$ and up) purchase. For micropayments there should be no lower limit on amounts, and contributing should take under a second. Like a button that contributes 5 cents.
