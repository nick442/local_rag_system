"I commend Chipotle for their decision, but I am a little confused on some parts. Pasture-fed beef definitely makes a difference, and I know that some farmers use steroids and some antibiotics to stimulate dairy production and growth. What I am confused about is this: My family owns a farm. Pasture-fed as much as possible - it is not feasible to do it year-round for us (Winter can be harsh sometimes). No unnecessary antibiotics used. To say that you are stopping the use of antibiotics completely is actually quite cruel to the animal. Infections can be prevalent in pasture-fed animals' feet. You can try to ""work"" the land as much as possible to prevent that, but in the end it is an inevitability. Something such as Penicillin (an antibiotic) is used to treat these infections. I have seen what happens when people do not treat the infections correctly and it can result in amputation of the infected foot. So I don't understand how **no** antibiotics at all is any better. The animal may suffer even more now because of it. Management of antibiotics may be a better solution. Anyone know more?"
