"I don't disagree that it is terrible what the current job situation is doing to people. And I didn't mean to imply that I thought it was ""good"" that in the dot-com bust people had to leave the field and find new careers. As I said before, this situation ""exists"". It's not good or bad, it's just how it is. The dot-com bust made a lot of engineers unemployable, receptionists and secretaries aren't in demand anymore, and there's nothing we can do to change the economics of the situation. I'm certain a tax credit for hiring the chronically unemployeed won't help, which is the point I came here to argue. If you're chastising me for being unsympathetic to those who dealing with this on a personal level, fine, I'll consider myself chastized. I'm still not seeing the point of your statements -- what are you suggesting needs to be done to help out the woman in TFA?"
