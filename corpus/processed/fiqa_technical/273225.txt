complete fucking bullshit line of thinking. There are far more expensive industrial development (silicon fabrication, each fab cost $3-15Billion). You don't see Samsung running around begging for patent extension do you? The pharma industry is bunch of con artist and scum. It has always been like that. (You do know Merck originally sold opium right?)
