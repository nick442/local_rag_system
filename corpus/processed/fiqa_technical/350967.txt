"Lolol. Is it ""survival of the fittest"" or ""arbitrary luck and randomness"" that fates today's worker? Make your mind up.

Really doesn't matter how passionate you are about being a doctor, if you are terrible at it, you can't be a doctor- this philosophy is not specific to ""evil, murdering capitalism"" it's consistent throughout. What you're talking about isn't a defined political or social ideology, it's Huggy-lovee-feefee Land."
