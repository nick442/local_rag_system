"> So I asked this question in /r/DebateaCommunist and got some interesting answers, mostly about how banks exist to make money out of nowhere and to fool people. What do yall have to say? That isn't what they said. Nobody mentioned fooling people from what I can see from a cursory glance. And if they did, they're being facetious. Also, they didn't mean ""make money from thin air"" in the sense of it being a magical trick. They make money from a sort of market inefficiency: they broker between people who want to invest money and those who want to borrow it. The top two answers are about right: a bank borrows money from investors (who deposit money in checking and savings accounts), and lends it to borrowers in the form of loans or mortgages. The difference between the interest rates is their profit. You deposit $1000 with me at 2% for 20 years. I give you $1485.95 at the end of that term. Where did I get the extra five hundred books? Well I lent it out in mortgages over the same terms at 6% and received $3207.14 over the same period of time. Your $1000 made you $485.95, and made me $1721.19 which I keep for the purposes of providing you with ATMs, dealing with bad debts and staffing the place. Simple, eh? Of course, they also provide other services in addition to this, and the way in which they do it is regulated, but that's all a bank is at its core. A central bank is slightly different: they issue money (i.e. ""print"" it), and supply it at a headline interest rate to the commercial banks. And of course banks borrow amongst themselves. But then we get ourselves down the rabbit hole of ""grown up"" economics and LIBOR and the like.. there are whole textbooks used to explain exactly how that mechanism works and what's going on there. But if you want to get rich, find a way to start a bank. Seriously. Doing it to the old school way is seriously profitable if you can be trusted."
