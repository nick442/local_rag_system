"Why do you keep going on about postive test results? You do realise that the drug doesn't last very long in the system, and as explained by the testimonies there were techniques to delay blood testing until it was clear from the system such as cyclists ringing each other up telling them that testers are here and to say out on the track for longer, or to dope more often at night when testers weren't around, or to simply not answer your door when testers came around. And yes there were was a test result, I don't remember which year exactly that when tested at the time was found to have no drugs, but thats because the drug he used wasn't detectable by any method. The blood was retested later on when they did have a method to test for it and they did find it in his system. Let's say I have a gun which disappears into thin air after firing. I use it to kill a person in a room full of people. Nobody sees me directly firing the gun but I do manage to use it to kill someone, and the gun disappears. Police search everyone including me for a gun but find no gun. They find that I had motive but again, no gun. Now a week later 26 of my accomplices, one of them who was the person who manufactured this magical gun, own up to the police and confess how I was able to do what I did. Wouldn't it be stupid of me to argue ""You never found a gun on me after the murder, therefore I'm innocent!"" The gun is like the drug. It disappears after use. With the drug it's not so instant but still disappears fairly quickly with regards to the blood testing frequency. Therefore do you not see how it is stupid to say ""No positive test results, therefore it's evidence he never used drugs!"" Again I'll reiterate it incase you still don't understand it. TRACES OF THE DRUG DISAPPEARS QUICKLY FROM THE BLOOD."
