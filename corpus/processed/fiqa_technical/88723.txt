The most important thing to remember about bitcoin is that it is an information technology. As you’re probably aware, information tech advances very rapidly and renders the previous generations obsolete. I too think bitcoin is in a bubble, though it probably has a while to go. Blockchain tech will rapidly improve and become more ubiquitous, meanwhile bitcoin offers nothing new and is plagued with issues. The fact it accounts for 50%+ of all crypto value is mind boggling. Imagine one stock accounting for 50% of the entire stock market of the world. When blockchain tech is mainstream, that’s essentially what bitcoin has to do to maintain its status. Seems very doubtful to me.
