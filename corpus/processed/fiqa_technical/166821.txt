"Both? Munny (eastwood) is killing bill 'cause bill tortured and killed his best friend. The ""deserved got nothing to do with it"" line is because he himself used to be a bandit and a murderer and feels like he just as likely deserves to die as the man he is killing, but that entire movie is about violent retributive justice. Least that's my interpretation of it. Oh yeah, and the guy who made unforgiven also made ""The day after trinity"" which is a bit slow paced, but is also one of the single most intense portraits of well intentioned human destruction I have ever seen. They interview all these physicists and engineers who built the A-Bomb and then flew to hiroshima and walked around seeing the realization of their work. They go full 1000 yard stare and just sort of lose it a little. It's worth seeing."
