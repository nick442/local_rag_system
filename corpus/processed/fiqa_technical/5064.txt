The Hong Kong Dollar is based on the US dollar. The Hong Kong central bank recognizes the US dollar as its reserve currency. That is, the Hong Kong central bank keeps US dollars as its main reserve. Not long ago the reserve currency of choice would have been gold. Central banks of each country would need to have enough gold to back up any currency they issued. Now central banks use the US dollar instead. This is what is meant when people mention the US dollar being the reserve currency for most countries. From wiki regarding the HK dollar: A bank can issue a Hong Kong dollar only if it has the equivalent exchange in US dollars on deposit.
