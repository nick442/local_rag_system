I've been doing healthcare financial consulting for a few years now and I was going to start studying to take CFA Level I and slowly change industries, but ended up learning programming instead. At this point in my career, I'll be way too far behind if I don't solely focus on increasing technical skills related to programming and data science. I think this is the point in time where if you don't start gaining experience and skills in those areas, any professional field is going to be out of reach in 5 years or so. For healthcare finance, no one will care that you have 10+ years of experience with the industry. If you can't turn the experience into useful data analysis, then no firm is going to want you. Right now, our firm has moved from the typical pyramid structure with tons of analysts on the bottom and a few high-level consultants at the top towards more of a balloon. Most of our staff are in the middle-tier and we are all with varying level of experience but our real selling point is how we are able to collect and process a hospital's data. I feel like I started working at a typical small finance firm and now I work at a typical SaaS style startup. So, we can feel it in other financial fields, so I'm sure you equity folks are going to have the same experiences.
