We specialise in bike sheds, but have a bespoke service and can design and build pretty much anything. We are sending two sheds to California next week, and already have one in Texas, as well as across Europe. Our website is www.thebikeshedcompany.com Being able to export without incurring huge shipping costs is our current challenge.
