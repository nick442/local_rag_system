"This answer assumes (based partly on your commants and some simplifying assumptions) As I see it you have a few options. Get a mortgage to buy your sister out. This avoids any ongoing involvement of your sister which may or may not be a good thing. It means you will be paying interest to a bank (or similar financial institution). Make an arrangement to buy the house in installments, possiblly in combination with some kind of rent. Likely to be a complex option to set up. Buy the house using a loan from your sister. potentially agree a ""private mortgage"" to protect your sister in the event you fail to pay. If interest is paid then it is likely to attract tax. Simply pay your sister rent, let her keep ownership of her half of the house either forever or until you have saved up the cash to buy her out. Rent is likely to attract tax. Whatever option you go with I would reccomend you get proffesional advice on any local legal/tax issues and drawing up the contracts. If you do go into an arrangement that keeps your sister involved make sure you discuss the what-ifs upfront and build them into your agreement. If you can't/won't pay what happens? can she insist that the house is sold and the proceeds split in some way? can she rent our her half of the house to someone else?"
