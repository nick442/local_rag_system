You read 'The E-Myth' now go ahead and read 'The E-Myth Revisited' but don't quit studies. Try to start a business while doing college, you will figure out many more things with your start-up, ups and downs both, but with no degree in hand you would never have well-paying job in your chosen education stream (something to fall back on) even if the business doesn't succeed or you find that your motivation isn't there. Whatever you do give it your 100%, that way you wouldn't have to walk as loser.
