I don't know what his problem is. IBM has been spending like drunken sailors on acquisitions for years now. IBM is being managed by half-wits who think financial engineering (stock buy backs, restructuring, M&A) is as good as actual engineering. Meanwhile the company has missed every significant technological shift since the 1980s. So if they make a massive, huge, great big acquisition you can be sure they'll pay too much for it, be unable to integrate it, and end up writing it down. After all, they are consistent in their incompetence. IBM shareholders have to fire the board. Once a new board is in place they can fire all of senior management and replace them with people who have at least a degree of competence. Most likely the company will just continue on its course to oblivion.
