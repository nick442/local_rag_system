So let me get this straight.. The CEO of Sears did a deal with another company he runs, his hedge fund. So he gives Sears a $200mil line of credit with a 9.75% interest rate. So, the only winner here is Eddie. Either he saves Sears with the line of credit (zero chance of that happening), or worst case, Sears fails and he still makes his 9.75% on the $200mil. Somehow I have a feeling this debt is going to be the first to be paid by Sears each month.. This is basically a $20mil gift from a bleeding Sears to Eddie.
