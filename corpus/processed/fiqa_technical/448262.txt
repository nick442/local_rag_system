It really depends on what part of finance you go into and where. As others mention, investment banking can be a grinder. When I was working for a large global financial institution in consumer lending, average for most people was probably 45 - 50 hours / week. But my last year there I spent about 65 hours / week but it was largely due to my position and regulatory compliance pressures. Now I consult for financial institutions. I'm gone from my family 3 - 5 nights a week but love both the work and my firm. When I'm home, I'm home and get to focus on my family. In the past, I would be so tired from the week that I wouldn't want to do much on the weekends. Now I spend my weekends devoted 100% to my family and friends. My wife and I are sure that the total number of quality hours I spend with my kids per week has actually increased now. Also, there has been some mention here about going outside the US - from my limited experience, financial firms within Europe are far more interested in employee experience than domestic ones.
