I never intended to get into a big debate on taxation. My point was that a buyback is the sane as a divided. Would you agree to that? Here's an interesting test. Does he have the same problem with dividend producing stocks? If he does then how else are firms supposed to give s return to investors? (Don't even think about saying through price appreciation because I'm sure you also have a rant for the drive for stock price.) This isn't a do we tax or not. That's overly broad for this piece. Also he isn't talking about taxing away profits but using taxes to cause businesses to make investments. Wouldn't you agree that if that extra factory was unproductive if it wouldnt have had an economical case to be invested in otherwise? Issuing taxes as a blunt tool to cause businesses to throw money at random projects is about the definition of misallocation. Can we agree to this, absent a taxation debate i generally avoid like the plague? You really are in a corner on how a company effectively passes a return to those who invested in them without subverting the whole pricing mechanism. Unless that is your point to do. Government control for all investments yeah!
