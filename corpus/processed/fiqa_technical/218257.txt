>Does he manipulate the Corporate BK laws by playing a Corp shell game and filing for BK protection - Yes. Is that like how I manipulate the laws of physics when I walk across the street? All parties are well aware of securities and bankruptcy law. It's not like he gets federal bankruptcy laws changed halfway through his business deals. Companies go bankrupt all the time, just because he lends his brand to a business doesn't mean that he should be personally responsible for anything. If Nike went bankrupt, should Lebron James NBA salary be taken from him?
