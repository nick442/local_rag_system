Are there any examples of compulsory paternity (or maternity) leave in the world? Where required, employers must offer it, and it is medically necessary for women to have some time to recover from the stress of childbirth, but I don't believe it's forced on the parents. I do believe, though, that many men would take the opportunity for paternity leave if it were more convenient than spending vacation or sick days (which aren't always available).
