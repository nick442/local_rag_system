I'm not one of the ones down voting.. nor am I interesting in getting into a debate about the specifics of Title VII (that is what the courts are ultimately for). Where I take issue is with a company that sells lights and your notion that a non christian couldn't possibly be suited to work there. Being 'born again' and a frequent church goer is hardly a prerequisite for an operations manager role. I have no issue with a company asking a potential employer if they are comfortable with the religiosity of the company but the line of questioning was totally inappropriate for the job. In any case it will be interesting to see where this case goes. if anywhere.
