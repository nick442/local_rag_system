"ok I'll bite. at the turn of the 20th century, 80% of the workforce in the United States was engaged in agricultural work. Today 5% of our workforce is in agriculture (i'm quoting these figures from memory so they may be a little off) . However we produce WAY more food now than we did 112 years ago - because of technology: farming techniques, genetic engineering, pesticides, heavy equipment, etc. in other words, today we're massively more productive in agriculture than we were 112 years ago with a small fraction of the work force. the same is going to happen in manufacturing. It's faster, better, more profitable, and safer to have robots do manufacturing work. you still need technicians, programmers, etc. to manage the robots but again, you can do more with less. what will people do for work when manufacturing goes the way of agriculture? SERVICES. people will always need other people to provide services - retail stores, doctors, lawyers, salespeople, accountants, programmers, entertainers, the list goes on and on. plus there are some things (think construction) that inherently need people to work. as long as there are people being born there will be ways to make money. specialization is a reality - people will need to ""re-skill"" and adapt. if society makes provisions for workers to re-skill and find employment we can avoid a bloody revolution. this is rambling and incoherent but the tl;dr is: we've been through economic transitions before (ag to manufacturing). this is just another transition and will probably not be the end of the world."
