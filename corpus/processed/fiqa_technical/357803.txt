"> I just recently found out that you guys had pledge of allegiance every fucking day in school. :) Yeah. In fairness, they can't actually force you to say it, and I don't think most schools say it any longer. I remember saying it when I was in kindergarten. But when I transferred back to public school in the 4th grade, they no longer said it. In retrospect, that's a hell of a commitment to expect from a 6 year old, ""I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America.."" Fuck that."
