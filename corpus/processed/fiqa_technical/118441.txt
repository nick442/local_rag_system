"> You know there is a heading in big bold text that says ""My budding product empire"" that conveniently links to actual products that make money for said author. It's 2/3 of the way down the page in the same colour and format as the rest of the text. It's very poorly displayed - any product or service should be prominently featured. > I think you have a problem with the whole way the author markets herself, but I obviously it works. That's not obvious, no. Anyone can make vague boasts about how much money they make, especially if those claims are aimed at attracting more business. The ones who brag the loudest are usually the ones with the biggest shortfall to make up. > Also I don't feel like it's bragging, it's more like sharing the wealth. Sharing what wealth? As I said, anyone can make hollow claims about how much money they make. It all sounds too much like those self-help books."
