Your analogy is a poor representation of my point. My point being that finding success in life is hard, no matter what you want to do. An idea that is consistent in all ideologies. Well, it is solely controlled by s/d, kinda. The things you listed all affect s/d which controls the market. Of course there will always be waves of new graduates to fill min wage jobs, because most everyone can do them, that was kinda my point. It's not so much the company controlling demand as it is the company adjusting to it, if there are an abundance of min wage jobs relative to the amount of workers, they wouldn't be min wage jobs. This premise of s/d is in no way unique to capitalism. And even the fluctuations in compensation to mirror your contribution and skills isn't unique to capitalism. Sure capitalism favors those with more capital, which is the point. In order to acquire capital you need to do productive things, which (idealy) are productive to some degree to society as a whole. So, acquire more capital- SEE IT'S SO EASY!
