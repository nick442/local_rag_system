">The fact of the matter is, if someone is sketchy enough to help you rob a bank, their character and judgement is suspect. That's a massive generalization and a value statement you cannot possibly back up. What if one is robbing a bank because the bank stole from him/her? What if there's a sick kid and the only option is to either rob a bank or allow the child to die? What if someone's family is being held hostage, and the hostage taker is forcing them to rob a bank? >This sentence is a bit of a fallacy in of itself after reading the linked article above. That's not what fallacy means. A fallacy is a logical misstep, like arguing against a person instead of their argument (ad hom), arguing against a different argument than the other party is making (strawman) or arguing that something is true because most people believe it (ad populum). If you think someone is wrong about something, you can say so and demonstrate it, but not everything you disagree with is a fallacy. >We just read about how the return on bank robbery is complete garbage, so anyone who would think it a good idea is de facto stupid. No, we read about how the average return on a bank robbery isn't worth it. Average. Not all. >And if you think there's any loyalty among criminals, you are incredibly naive.. ""There's no honor among thieves"" is just a fun turn of phrase. It's not some philosophical or psychological law."
