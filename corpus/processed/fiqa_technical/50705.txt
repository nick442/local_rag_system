"> That is a matter of opinion. Obviously, I disagree with that sentiment. Do you have a reason behind it? No. False. ""Taxation is theft"" is an empirically true statement. It is not an opinion. It is a fact. Theft is taking of another person's property (in this case income) without that person's permission or consent, usually by coercion. Coercion is using force or threats of violence to persuade someone to do something. So a tax is coerced contribution to state and/or federal revenues. Therefore taxation is theft."
