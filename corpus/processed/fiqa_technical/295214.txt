Yeah but that wasn't the whole point behind his statement, which was offered in support of the notion that the low-height zoning was the reason for the housing shortage. The reason population density matters is that it's been necessary for Japan to build expensive, high rise housing that's earthquake resistant. Until recently, it would have been unnecessary to zone differently in New Zealand. The implication, I think, is that Japan didn't start building high rise housing until it became more cost prohibitive to build out than up. I don't care about the matter at hand, but I felt a need to referee the fact that the rebuttal did, in fact, negate his point somewhat, and you just happened to pick the part of his point it didn't negate ;-)
