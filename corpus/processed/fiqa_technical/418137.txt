"From the article: > Employment relations minister Jo Swinson said: ""Pregnancy discrimination is illegal, immoral and completely unacceptable. There is no excuse for such attitudes from these employers, who frankly are dinosaurs. Yeah, it might be illegal.. but only in the context of when the idea is spoken out loud & and the final selection is male. which is why the notion is kept internally to the mind of the hiring manager, and why the final selection is based on merit. Good thing there is no such thing as thought crime."
