I see this as the reason for the country (and world?) heading toward ever greater income inequality. More and more wealth accruing to capital as opposed to labor. Ah, so we won't need as much money to live, that's hopeful. Why don't we use these solutions to solve current high unemployment? Don't believe that prices of goods will come down as quickly as people are fired from their jobs. That will only happen when people are forced to stop buying things and corporate inventories climb too high (recession/depression). This will be bad for business as well, as those inventories were created using high labor expense from prior times and now must be sold at heavy discount.
