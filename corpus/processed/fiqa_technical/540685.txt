> At the end of the day, that stockpiled wealth is still wealth we don't have that the Japanese people can rely upon At the end of the day, the pile of real goods they worked to send us is real wealth we have that they don't. Bearing in mind that their stockpile of dollars isn't a constraint on the *issuer* of the dollar. >I'm saying let's actually figure out a method for determining our constraints scientifically in real time, and adapt our policy accordingly! Sounds good. Going back a ways in the thread, the indicators you want to look at are employment, output and inflation. Slack employment & output with low inflation indicate not enough spending, full employment with little to no output gap and stable prices tells you you have it right and rising inflation tells you it's too high. To a great degree, finding the mark takes care of itself when fiscal policy is built around strong automatic stabilizers, spending that is counter-cyclical by design.
