If you look at a few facts you can quickly understand the boom in the 1980's. Housing is the biggest driver of our economy because it drives consumption. When people buy a house the spend money. Baby boomers delayed buying houses because of a decade long recession in the 1970's because of a high price for oil. Oil price dropped from $100 to $10 per barrel. Taxes were cut for everybody. Baby boomers went on a seven year housing binge. Did corporate tax cuts help, sure, were they the primary reason for the growth, not even close. If anything they gave businesses a taste for how much they could save by cutting taxes and set loose the lobbying to cut taxes leading to huge federal deficits and debt.
