Good points. I'd like to add some more: 6. Automation is deflationary 7. Low birth rate is deflationary 8. Declining educational level is deflationary 9. Migration of uneducated people is deflationary 10. Declining EROI is deflationary The printing press only inflates the valuation of assets, causing the inequality to rise. For people who do not have assets, life becomes more and more unaffordable. Redistribution of wealth cannot solve this problem, as the financial markets require a growing money base. Otherwise, Hyperinflation would be an inevitable consequence. Economic decline is merciless.
