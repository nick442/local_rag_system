(I'm a bot) ***** > The researchers, using a massive government survey of Americans over age 50, estimated in a new working paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research that living with chronic pain makes people so unhappy that they&#039;d need to earn between $20,000 and $50,000 per year more to be as happy as they would be otherwise with no pain. > The economists who did this study say it&#039;s important so that policymakers can decide how much money they should assign to pain treatment versus other spending priorities. > That&#039;s actually lower than values determined in previous research - a 2014 study of Australian data found people in pain would need $645 per day, or more than $235,000 per year, to make up the lost life satisfaction. ***** [**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/6stes2/how_much_is_living_a_painfree_life_worth/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ ""Version 1.65, ~187749 tl;drs so far."") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr ""PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome."") | *Top* *keywords*: **pain**^#1 **people**^#2 **research**^#3 **chronic**^#4 **opioid**^#5"
