"That depends on on the Global Macro you're applying for; your best bet is to look at their investment policy/strategy on their website. If that's not available, it's actually a good interview question (i.e. a question for you to ask the interviewer). To be clear, what I think is a good question for you to ask is ""so what's your investment strategy?"" It shows that the candidate isn't presuming anything and that s/he knows that there's an adherence to an underlying discipline. In my opinion, don't pitch anything. If it was me; even if I did know their investment approach, I wouldn't pitch an idea in an interview, unless asked. If they do ask you for your opinion, tell them your idea (assuming that you know their investment approach and what your pitching adheres to it). Interviewers sometimes ask such questions to gauge whether you have a ""finger on the pulse of the market"". So in summary: 1. Find out their investment strategy. 2. If it's not online, then ask what it is in the interview. 3. Show that you understand the strategy. 4. Don't pitch an idea unless asked; if asked, show how your idea adheres to the underlying strategy."
