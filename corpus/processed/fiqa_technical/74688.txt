"A.1 and B.1 are properly balanced, but ""Business Expense"" is an expense, not an asset. The T entries should be timestamped. The time should be equal to the time on the credit card receipts. This will make audit and balancing easier. A or B can be used, but if the the business is to be reimbursed for personal expenses, the accounts should be renamed to reflect that fact. More explicit account names could be ""Business expense - stationary"" and ""Personal expense - lunch"" or even better ""Personal expense - cammil - lunch"". With a consistent format, the account names can be computer parsed for higher resolution and organization, but when tallying these high resolution accounts, debits & credits should always be used. When it comes time to collect from employees, only accounts with ""Personal expense"" need be referenced. When it comes time to collect from ""cammil"", only net accounts of ""Personal expense - cammil"" need be referenced. An example of higher resolution, to determine what ""cammil"" owes, would be to copy the main books, reverse any account beginning with ""Personal expense - cammil"", and then take the balance. Using the entries in the question as an example, here's the account to determine ""cammil""'s balance: Now, after all such balancing entries are performed, the net credit ""Personal expense - cammil"" is what ""cammil"" owes to the business. The scheme for account names should be from left to right, general to specific."
