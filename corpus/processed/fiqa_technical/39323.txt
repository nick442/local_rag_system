Considered that in Italy even no-profit hospitals are not tax exempt, I also see no reason to exempt *any* property of the Church. However, it is not so easy. In a historical and legal perspective, keep in mind that in Italy the Roman Catholic Church is not an entity like the others. [Treaties](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concordat) between the Vatican and Italy exist.
