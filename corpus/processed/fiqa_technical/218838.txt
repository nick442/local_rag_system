I'll make sure to save this and we can come discuss it as things develop. I'm willing to bet my next paycheck on Trump resigning and being indicted while Hillary will not even being indicted. I'm not saying the email thing wouldn't have lost some people their jobs and brought on possible charges, but it's not a super serious crime and as she no longer and will not in the future need security clearance, there's not much point in going after her because it's over and so is her career. However, Trump & Cos alleged, collusion with Russia is an ongoing issue if true.
