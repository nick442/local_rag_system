I live 15 minute from the Horseshoe casino opening next month in baltimore and 20 from Maryland Live. Id still MUCH rather go to the Borgata in AC, just because it is so so so much nicer. I usually go there a few times a year, ill go to MD Live if my friends want to and Im bored. AC casino = compd rooms, free drinks and nicer restaurants . I go for little getaways though, for people who just wanna go play cards for a couple hours it makes sense.
