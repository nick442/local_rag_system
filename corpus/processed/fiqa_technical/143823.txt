So the Euro was doomed from the start because there was no provisions of kicking out and/or halting countries from excessive borrowing? I think the Euro is stronger in the long run because no single country can put inflationary pressure on the Euro due to irresponsible borrowing by that single state (e.g. United States). In the end of the day, they have to work their way out of debt with real economic growth thusly making it an attractive currency for the long term.
