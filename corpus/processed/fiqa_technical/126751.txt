"I can pretty much guarantee you that the vast majority of new small companies will NOT grow to have 50 workers (they probably won't even have 49 workers, or 48, or even 47). Once they approach 40, other ""solutions"" -- even beyond the ""part time employees"" suggested by the author (a thing I would expect will be ""addressed"" by a change in the detailed regulations -- the Federal government will attempt to stop this obvious loophole by redefining what constitutes a ""full time employee"") -- MANY other solutions will be executed (dividing the company into two or three distinct entities with slightly different ownership {for example wife owns one location, husband another, etc}, plus the obvious expanded use of temp agencies, contract and/or subcontract workers, subbing work {especially generic administrative work} out to other firms, etc). Any and all of those will probably cost far LESS than $40k a year (which is probably a woefully underestimated number)."
