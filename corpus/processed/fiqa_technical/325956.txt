I'm confused. Is it that the DRM prevents you from freely distributing the books after you've bought them or what? My wife and I share an account so we can share books. There's a lending feature with Amazon that lets you lend many books. Many libraries already have lending programs that Amazon (and other e-readers) work with. Amazon has a fledgling lending program (which my wife is actually using for the first time). DRM is really really not a big deal for me or anyone else I know with a kindle. Add to that I'm largely reading books that cost less than four dollars from new authors who aren't writing full time. I want to support them so they'll keep making content I want. Some DRM helps keep their work from being freely distributed.
