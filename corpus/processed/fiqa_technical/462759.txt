Hi all - I'm a UX designer working on a design challenge as part of an interview. I'm looking to learn more about how traders select securities to monitor and how they create alerts to track values of interest. If you could walk me through the last time you: - Decided on a security you wanted to monitor and set up a system to monitor the security - Which fields (e.g., last price, volume, etc) you were most interested in tracking for that security - If you created alerts for any fields (e.g., price) - If you did create an alert: what the alert was for, the steps you took to create it, and how the alert notified you of a change Any information you can provide would be super helpful! Please include your current role and the number of years you have experience trading. Even if you're not currently a trader or relatively new/in school any answers would be helpful!
