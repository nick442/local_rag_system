"But their economy is based on -- built upon -- the very concept of debt, just like the U.S. and most other advanced economies on the planet. Debt itself isn't the problem -- having to borrow to get capital and then *service the debt* is where the problems appear because whilst one group in the economy continues this old pattern of issuing debt and expecting payback with interest, another prominent group has been undercutting the ability of debtors to service their debt by shifting how products and services develop and are used by the public. It's the old ""watch this hand"" trick with the other hand stabbing you when you're not looking. Simply put, you can't have an economy based upon the debt/return-on-interest model while -- at the very same time -- having an economy based on make-everything-in-China/India production/service model: If you make people have to borrow money to have money, then you *must* give them a way to service that debt; otherwise, you're just a daft bastard who refuses to acknowledge that adding two and two returns four; an imbecile who insists that he can indeed have his cake and eat it too; I could go on but the point is made."
