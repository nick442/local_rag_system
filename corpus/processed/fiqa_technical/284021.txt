"Kiva.org is a nonprofit organization and does not pay you (the lender) any interest. From their website: Kiva does not guarantee repayment nor do we offer a financial return on your loan. Therefore Kiva will not improve your yield, as there is no money to make. It is intended you people who want to make ""charitable"" loans. That said, I think Kiva is an awesome organization."
