What a pointless list! It's ranked by total short interest outstanding. That's completely meaningless. For instance, a $1 billion company with $1 billion in shorts (meaning the market thinks it's bankrupt) would be ranked much better than a $100 billion company with $1.1 billion in short interest. tl;dr: pure and utter bullshit
