I am happiest on my bicycle, but money bought the sorta fancy bicycles I ride and the ipod that plays the music. It also buys the food along the way of my trip and the camera I use to take photos of the beauty I find. I am happy without the camera, but I need music for any trip longer than 50 miles.
