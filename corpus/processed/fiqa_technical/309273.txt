I believe though, qualifying experience is determined by your local society. What counts as experience in Yellowknife may not count in London. When I moved to a new society they didn't accept my past work history as qualifying (previous society did), however, I was already done the first two exams and had a front office role, so I didn't challenge the ruling or look into it any further. Maybe there was/is an appeal process.
