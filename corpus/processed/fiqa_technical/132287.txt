"Hi guys, hopefully someone reads this even though this thread has gotten kind of old. Might ask again next week. Anyway, I'm a finance student and currently an intern for a big FS company. My internship is pretty fun and I'm learning a lot, but very little technical skills (the internship is in compliance and that's not where I want to end up after I graduate). My question is, over the summer, what should I learn? As in, take online courses on coursera or by reading a book. I know you'll probably answer ""Whatever interests you"", but with limited knowledge on the matter, it all seems equally interesting to me. Should I try myself at programming? What language? Should I learn excel modelling? Does anyone have any suggestions?"
