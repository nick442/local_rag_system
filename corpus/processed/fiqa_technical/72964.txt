"And please tell me what is my agenda? By alluding banks are ponzi schemes? I never made that claim. I just saw a similarity. I was asking if the similar idea of taking money from investors and returning it (just like a ponzi scheme), but the similarity ends there apparently. In the background one is using future investors as payouts; the other uses fractional reserve banking to reinvest. To me it seems like the latter just seems ""smart"" but idk. That was my agenda. Finding out if my latter idea was possible and/or why its [not] a ponzi schem e and how does it differ. I think I got the answer w the accounting equation but getting to that point was like trial by fire apparently."
