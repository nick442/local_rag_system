"Whoops, paywall. Here's a [link around the wall](http://archive.is/6quZg). >The first offshore wind installation in the U.S., a $300 million, 30-megawatt project off Rhode Island, began turning six months ago. >But the Block Island wind farm in the U.S. currently generates power for 24.4 cents per kilowatt-hour, while offshore wind projects in Europe can come in well under 10 cents per kilowatt-hour. Developers are optimistic that, as occurred in Europe, prices will go down as more projects begin and a supplier network takes shape in the U.S. It's interesting the seas are seen as a good place for wind farms, given that land developments are already profitable. Iowa is a [leader](http://www.energyfactcheck.org/fact-checks/wind-power-isn-t-a-significant-part-of-america-s-energy-portfolio). >The levelized (or ""all-in"") cost of wind energy ranges from $0.07 per kW/h to $0.10 per kW/h, making wind energy cost-competitive with fossil fuels and even cheaper than coal energy in many areas. Of course, it's not easy or efficient to move electricity from Iowa to the coasts, hence the offshore developments."
