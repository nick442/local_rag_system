Setting aside the fears of hyperinflation and such, do you see a moral hazard with QE and increasing the money supply in general? I understand that the idea is to stimulate spending with slight inflation (i.e. spend it now while it's worth more), but by doing so, don't you effectively punish savers and thereby undermine their economic autonomy?
