>because they've reliably delivered in the past, we can assume that their promises are good. Exactly, that's one of the points I was trying to make. It's your past work that determines your status. The other point I was trying to get across is that paper money is a symbolic representation while the things we consume are material objects and services. If the production is not there money is meaningless. When people complain about the high cost of college student loans, for instance, they forget that a lot more people want a college education now than in the time their parents grew up. If there aren't enough seats in the classrooms, some people will be left without the college education they want, no matter how the financing is provided.
