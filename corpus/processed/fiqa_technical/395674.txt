"That's because college graduates are a dime a dozen and don't know shit, and insist on white collar jobs in which they do not labor. An average highschool graduate will take a blue collar job and get paid handsomely for working up a sweat. A clever one will learn a trade and get paid north of 40K/yr with less than two years experience. Give the kid an associate's degree or an apprenticeship program and you can tack half again on top of that inside five years. Getting degrees is a loosing proposition, and getting worse as everyone goes back to get a Master's degree because their Bachelor's is useless. Learning a skill is a winning proposition. If you want to stay out of debt, do not, *do not,* DO NOT ""go to college."" Get an associate's degree and get a job. Many companies are so starved for skilled help they will guarantee employment to anyone who graduates with a related degree. Work the job and take night classes to finish your bachelor's, preferably in a major related to your field of work. Gain experience and demand higher pay. Then get higher pay. Laugh at the law school students with +100K in debt who will never earn enough to repay their loans."
