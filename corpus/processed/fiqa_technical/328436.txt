>Sounds like something that should be free to me. Carry on. Google's vested interest in mapping isn't necessarily in selling the data, it's in controlling the market, building better data and correlating it with users to deliver better advertising results as well as better results for local businesses. Asking Apple to pay is a big check, but losing how many tens of millions of mobile users is definitely a blow to Google's quest, which is likely why they'll release a maps application for iOS that is free. The usage data is more important to them than charging for access to the data (at least, for now).
