"> Not all Bachelor's are the same, DeVry.. Of course! A degree in ""gender studies"" is worthless, while a degree in ""computer science"" worth more. But, with so many ""computer science"" degrees, even that degree does not give you much headway.. without experience. It's very simple what happens today, compared to the past. Today, the idea is to keep kids in schools, for as long as possible (because BAs are worthless and you need Masters), charge them tons of money, pass them so they continue to pay, get them into debt and then pay them less, because so many people have the degrees. Even require BA degree for jobs that don't need it. In the past, if you finished high school, it was an accomplishment. If you got accepted to college, it was an accomplishment. If you survived the first year in college or got your bachelor degree, it was a major accomplishment. **If you did not know, those accomplishments in the past gave you substantial(!) benefits compared to others.** It was much cheaper in the past and much better education. They did not care about money, and will kick you out of college for any fail. So, in the past to be a teller in the bank, you did not need to finish high school, but just be good with basic algebra. **Today, you need a BA degree and get a lousy salary to be teller in a bank. Do you understand what happened here?** Also, in the past, a person with lower socioeconomic background, if they finish high school or got a BA, it would (for sure) really change their lives and they become middle or high class. Today, a person with poor socioeconomic background, even if they got their [worthless] BA degree, they are worst off because they do not have any competitive advantage over other people as all of them have degrees too.. you are worst off, because you are in debt to get the degree and the ""education"" you got is bad."
