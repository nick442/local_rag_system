"is this going to turn into one of those oh-so-common cases where you demand an example, and then when I actually give you an example, you will just say ""lol that doesn't count for such and such reasons, give me another"" and we end up in an endless loop where you keep just moving the goalposts? medieval Iceland. There was no government, just various local chiefs. people could voluntarily choose to join under a chief if they wanted, who would provide them with legal protection in return for whatever form of payment/service. legal disputes within a chieftain's ""clan"" were solved privately, as were disputes between rival clans. There was effectively no government. This lasted for a few hundred years, eventually a Norwegian king basically garnered support and eventually took over. it wasn't perfect anarcho-capitalism, but it was certainly a society without a government, and it did relatively well."
