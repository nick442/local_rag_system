It isn’t that the starving man doesn’t have money, it is that he doesn’t have access to eggs! He is on the same indifference curve due to finances as the wealthy man. What has made you assume a difference of financial ability, when I already said there were none? Were he in an area of abundant resources, which you seem to assume in your counter-arguments, then he would be willing to pay for lower quality, for the lower prices those lower quality are offered at, because he need not mention his plight. I’m not that thinking the world as it should be. I am thinking of human nature as we have observed, not financial nature. Because humans create the financial systems. The financial systems do not create human nature. Financial systems DO influence human nature.
