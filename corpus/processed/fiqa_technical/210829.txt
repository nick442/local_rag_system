And this tells me you have little to no understanding. I have LIVED this life, I am black, from an inner city, my father is a deadbeat and my mother was diagnosed with MS, leaving her disabled until she died before I graduated from high school. My grandmother raised me while trying to care for a daughter that couldn't walk and another daughter struck blind by disease. Without public assistance, I wouldn't have been healthy enough to get a scholarship to a very expensive boarding high school, and really isolate myself from the shit around me. i have cousins who died living the gangster bullshit life, I know this world from seeing it. I make a fairly decent amount of money now, why, because when I couldn't find a job, I could still eat on food stamps and go to a free program to qualify for the government to pay for my IT certification. So, seeing as I KNOW how the system can be used to get to a better place, make a goddamn argument that your idea works better, not how you feel things should be. I make me decisions based on what I've seen, I have known women shafted by circumstance struggling to be able to work because they need a specific number of hours to ensure they can have child care so they can work at all. I have tutored adults that never graduated high school because they had to drop out and work years ago to help their families afford to live. I have used medicaid to help with my horrible episodes of depression, gotten treatment my family alone could not afford. I have watched my aunt recover from drug addiction using treatment my family could not afford. My grandmother is alive and still helping the down and out in our family due to medical equipment the family could not afford on its own. I do base my decisions on evidence, I have lived the fucking evidence.
