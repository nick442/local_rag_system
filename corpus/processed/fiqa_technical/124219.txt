Congrats on finishing your time and starting school. I recommend reading the Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham. Other than being a great basic investing book, it highlights a shift from actively managed brokerage accounts. If you want to be an IB, it is important to understand the market you are getting into (and the different changing aspects of it). As for further reading / prep, start learning about the Series 7, 63, 66 exams. Become comfortable with finances and never stop reading. Good luck!
