"The elephant in the room is the research. From the article it seems to conclude that the majority of the research happened in the US, but Microsoft is claiming it happened overseas. From what I've seen a lot of *initial* research does happen in Microsoft international offices, all further development to bring it to market might be done in the US but the idea sprung elsewhere. From a taxation perspective you can argue that the patent was invented offshore and profits should be allocated there, or you can argue that it was the US development investment that made it profitable and so profits should be allocated in the US. Both are right - and this makes the US so interesting to invest in. If you invest in the US and then license offshore to sell back to a US entity - thats just exploiting a loophole. If it was invented offshore, thats what the laws are trying to protect. Personally I think Microsoft is doing pretty well here, like the demo of translations from chinese sign language to english - MSR Asia invented it, but it will be US teams transform it to a feature that derives income. Where should it be taxed if it does become a real product? How many other areas of Windows, Visual Studio, Office, Azure were ""invented"" by non-US teams and should also be taxed offshore?"
