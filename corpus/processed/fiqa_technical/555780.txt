Ive said my plea, and my experience in the domain makes me very comfortable trashing that article; if you want to trust him no questions asks, by all means, just makes you as arrogantly ignorant as he is portrayed by this article. Really sounds like this article was written based on the markets of 2010. I am not crying, just pointing out how your arrogance and your insults are not backed by much, and its not the first time I've seen an academic thinking he understands the markets so well, while not understanding shit about it.
