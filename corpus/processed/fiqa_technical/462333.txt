"> Boeing's union workers are overcompensated. Compared to who? Some hypothetical unemployed North Carolinian? By that metric, we're all ""overcompensated."" I guarantee you that there's someone, somewhere (probably many someones in many somewheres) that would be happy to do your job for a lot less money. Does that mean that all publicly traded companies have a duty to demand tax incentives to not move to North Carolina, or Poland, or Cambodia? I may sound hyperbolic about this, but I'm completely serious in that question. Calling someone overcompensated means that the prevailing wage in the competitive labor market for the same quality of work is lower, not just assuming that someone would be willing to do it if you offered them $40k and a wrench. The fact is, Boeing has not been able to produce any compelling data about ""overcompensated"" workers ([the NLRB just ruled that it has failed in doing so with it's engineering union and has ordered it to back up their claim](http://www.kplu.org/post/nlrb-judge-boeing-failed-bargain-good-faith-speea)), so all you've got is a baseless assertion behind this whole argument. Moreover, the idea that Boeing ""needs to reduce wages in order to remain competitive"" is baseless as well. That's easy to say and strikes an intuitive chord with the public, but there's no evidence that Boeing ""needs"" to do this. They may want to do it, but they could save the same amount of money in countless other ways (stopping making stupid decisions to outsource large components around the world would be a great way to save money, for starters). Reducing wages is a desire, not a need."
