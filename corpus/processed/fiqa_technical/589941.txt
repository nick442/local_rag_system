"On what are you basing this theory? Google has partnered with cities like Kansas City to create or use existing infrastructure. For example, KC has waived a huge fee for utility pole use. In other cases, they buy/lease the existing fiber that the city owns for $1. They have cut through the installation barriers by working only with cities that are willing to deal. Google ""Overland Park Kansas Google fiber"", you'll find them without fiber because they didn't want to work with Google. Soon they will be a fiber-less island in the KC metro area. Google wants everyone to have better internet, assured net neutrality and make a profit. They will make a profit on this venture faster than you think. Moreover, their competition will have to actually compete which will be better for all of us. I also predict city mayors will start getting elected on a simple campaign of ""Bring Google Fiber here or let's build it ourselves"". Who wouldn't vote for that candidate in a city with a Comcast monopoly?"
