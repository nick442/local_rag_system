True on the second point. It is information based. My bad. With regard to the first point, I don't think he's Jesus returned. He makes plenty of mistakes but he does provide the return record of a very disparate group of investors following the same method. That method may not work anymore (hard to say) but I think it does. I'm obviously a true believer. With respect to third point, I don't think you were being a dick. Enjoyed the debate. Thanks for the perspective
