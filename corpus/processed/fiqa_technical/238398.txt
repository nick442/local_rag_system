Have tact. Don't outright ask for it but drop all the hints/info for him to add two and two together. If he doesn't offer it to you today, he might tomorrow so don't ask for too much at once (you'll sound pushy and needy) and just appreciate the time to speak with someone successful even if he doesn't offer you a job. During the interview, you'll want to find that right balance between being inquisitive and being stupid. Anything you can Google is probably a stupid question. Anything that asks for his opinion on a topic relevant to his field should be a better option. Career advice and any life advice and stories of how he tackled common problems you're facing are safe options. At least that's my take on how these interviews should work. Easier said than done so keep practicing like you are now. Good luck.
