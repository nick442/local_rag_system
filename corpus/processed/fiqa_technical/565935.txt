That doesn't make sense. He needs the exposure to grow his business not a product iterations that are not even valuable to customers. With that being said, I think the top comment on this thread with having the Instagram and Trip advisor presence is spot on. The only product iteration (that would result in broader exposure) I could think of, would be providing an extremely personalized experience to clients, offering them 1/2 day trips visiting interesting places, guiding them, making their experience of the trip remarkable. This would result in lot of exchanges numbers, reviews and recommendations.
