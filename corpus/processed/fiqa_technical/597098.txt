I don't think that it necessarily means they were more intelligent at all. China and India historically were always the wealthiest and most technologically advanced nations economically until very recently. Europe was mainly more advanced militarily. It's not like intelligence changes that much for a population over just a few generations. Europe was really only more advanced after the crusades and even then they were only more advanced due to their quick adaptation of gun powder, which originally came from china.
