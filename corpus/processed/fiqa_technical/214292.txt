>but it sounds like you know we won't be better off, but want it anyway, just because you don't want other people to get a better deal than you. Most people drive less than me. I wouldn't be getting a better deal than most other people. Most other people would actually get a better deal than me in a private road system. Right now, I'm one of the one's benefiting from the system we have. >I don't think it is irrelevant. If everyone is better off working together why not work together? It's irrelevant to me because I don't think the Federal government should do anything beyond protect your basic rights. I'd gladly pay more because I'm choosing to pay more than be forced to pay simply because the government taxes me.
