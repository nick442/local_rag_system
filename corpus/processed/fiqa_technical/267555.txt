To your question regarding contracts, I'd say it's like anything else. Having a contract always helps to protect both parties in the event of a dispute. Given that you both are in different countries, it may be a major headache to try to sue and enforce contractual rights. So, it's up to you and your attorney(s) to decide if a contract is worthwhile. I'd say your best bet is to use an escrow service. That would be the safest way to do it. An escrow service assures both parties that the transaction will proceed without any shenanigans. Personally, if we're talking about a high value property, I'd have my attorneys draft a contract and use an escrow service.
