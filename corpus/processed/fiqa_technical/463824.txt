Who do you think invented minimum wage? Unions did. Regulated working hours? A bunch of other things you take for granted? Minimum wage workers have to put up with a lot of bad things, including people looking down on them because they make little money(but not because they are poor, that would be classist and politically incorrect), mostly from people they work for including customers.
