So why are people still buying 15 year old Saturns or driving the same GM Denali for the last 13 years when the new cars are so much more efficient and cheaper to run? Poor people are fucking poor. Now you turn to Indonesia. How much do you think they are spending to maintain their vehicles? Next to nothing, that's what. They'll only fix it enough to get it running again. SAE certified mechanic? LOL, the guy between the whore house and the cigarette vendor can also do it. How much do you think electricity costs in the Philippines? It can cost $100 USD a month to run the AC at night to get a decent sleep..The average Filipino makes less than $10 a month.
