When a car company offering an extended warranty shows up on my front page 4 times I think it's safe to say we're beyond circlejerk and into ultrajerk. People don't even read the part about the warranty only covering 8 years, they just read the infinite mileage claim and start gagging on Techno Jesus' balls. Reddit's obsession with Tesla is beyond cringeworthy.
