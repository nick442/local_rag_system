Anyone with a computer can check out the gross private domestic investment chart that the St. Louis Fed supplies to the public. Flattening like a pancake. Doesn't take a genius to realize this is a leading indicator for the economy. I would be more worried about another recession and potential negative nominal rates before I'd be worried about Fed asset sales.
