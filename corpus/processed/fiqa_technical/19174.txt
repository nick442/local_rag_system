you should put it all down within reason. I don't think most people have any big names on their resumes when they apply, but having substantive experience to talk about is important. Just because its not a multinational company doesn't mean your experience is invalidated or anything. If you feel like any of your experience lines are not particularly important, you can either list then as a line item with no experience description, or you can get rid of them entirely. But you should definitely have your experience from at least the last two years listed, as well as anything relevant to business/finance.
