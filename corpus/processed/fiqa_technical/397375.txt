One surprising thing in your analysis was classifying Applebees as quick service restaurant. Do people really think like that? Personally I always thought Applebees as a regular restaurant just one of the cheap ones? The time it takes to eat at Applebees vs another restaurant is really not that different unless you are talking about very expensive restaurants with multi course menus. So when comparing places, time is usually not a factor and it boils down to quality and price. Unfortunatley Applebees suck at quality and their price isn't really that different from other bar restaurants in our area.
