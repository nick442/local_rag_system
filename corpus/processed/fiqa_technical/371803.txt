"I have an MScF (Undergrad Math/Econ) and I currently work in algo trading, I started off on the buy side and then went off on my own after I got a large enough bonus for seed capital,.. :) Quantitative Finance is not a ""small field"" within it there are subfields (there are much more subfields that these). Econometrics/Statistical/Research methods, time series analysis, statistics, stochastic calculus, data mining Asset Management/Trading: Building testing and implementing models, usually you have an idea, test it and implement it, requires a lot of good time series skills, statistical skills and programming and be good at research. Modelling/Pricing/Risk, building better pricing models, coming up with elegant solutions, so a strong knowledge of stochastic calc, Differential Equations, Partial Differential Equations, Monte Carlo Simulations, etc 12 Months will not make you an expert in any of the above. You may learn enough to understand it. Quant Finance is something you learn by doing, yes you need to understand the theory but its just theory until you start to implement it. Finally if you do an MFin/MscF/MFE make sure there is a THESIS otherwise it will be tough to do a PhD after. If you want a taste, grab some R/Matlab/Whatever and try and program some common SSRN papers."
