"The faster they eliminate menial jobs the sooner we can start retraining our workforce for a modern economy. You contradict reality. The study says, ""Traditionally, a high proportion of workers in the low-wage market are not experienced at all: teens with their first jobs, immigrants with their first jobs here,” he said. “Data is pointing to: Since we have to pay more, employers are looking for people with **experience who can do the job from Day 1**.”"" How many low-level jobs do we see require multiple years of experience now days? This is a problem of raising the minimum wage. ""Jobs"" is a worthy cry. Because right now, the job is being eliminated. So you have teens and immigrants getting NO income, which is somehow better than a little income? Teens don't need a ""livable wage"" and adults who do can get subsidies from the government WHILE they gain experience and work up to higher pay. NO JOB means no way to get either of those."
