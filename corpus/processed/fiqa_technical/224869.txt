I have not come across any studies that address this specifically. Personally, I would want 5 years of stability to compare to an equal period prior to 2008 and I am not convinced that we have that. I would envision such an outcome however, as a result of belt-tightening in light of the recession carrying over as business-as-usual afterwards. The pace of progress makes it difficult to make one to one comparisons but were I to draft a question for consideration it would probably be: Does salary of job description X (e.g. software engineer) earn an amount equal to the same position during 2002-2007 in adjusted dollars? Some controls would most likely be necessary.
