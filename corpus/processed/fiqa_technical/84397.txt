"> the business class replace engineer/programmer-managers. This is more true than you know. As someone who has worked at Microsoft and talked to many senior executives, the leadership doesn't really ""get"" technology the way they used to. It's been happening for a while, and the best example of it was probably the Gates/Ballmer transition. Microsoft, at best, will eventually become another GE - a company that develops technology, but no longer a company driven by technology and innovation. Of course, nothing is changing in the short term though, not as long as Windows and Office keep printing money."
