"I have a basic rule: it is the ""business"" guy's responsibility to raise the money. If they can't do it, then they are incompetent, and the ""tech"" guy should avoid them. Generally speaking, the business side needs to be able to identify and validate the market opportunity, define the product, handle sales and marketing and raise the money. The tech side needs to translate the product definition into a technical solution and build it. If you have programming skills, you have plenty of options, and should not partner with people who can't do their part. You can probably handle the business side of things as well, though there is a difference in skill and temperament. Find someone who is as good or better at the business side than you are at programming."
