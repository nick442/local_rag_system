"That all sounds very nice, but the whole point of this conversation and this thread was that a person does not choose the circumstances in which they were born. Biologically yes, you are right. We are a product of the generations that came before us. But does that mean that we can blame a poor child for being born poor? Is it that child's fault that they their families cannot afford good education, or even good food? Are you actually suggesting that it is acceptable to tell a suffering child, ""Sorry, you should have chosen better parents?"" I really hope that is not what you are implying."
