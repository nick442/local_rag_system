I would never, ever recommend that to a startup business like what's being discussed here. You're talking about a larger, regional business that's doing at least $200,000 a year in revenue, if not significantly more, for a $15,000 site to be effective. Or an e-commerce store. But, yeah. Your price is right for that sort of thing.
