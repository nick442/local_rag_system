They still got away with pocketing the cash and I got uhh DSL (shitty limited range technology) and other crummy something or other long distance options! Fuck MA BELL. Name any phone company, it's still MA BELL. Smaller competitive with someone else company my ass. They're letting it merge back together too. I still love the day our towns Main Street was being torn up to be repaved. During this little adventure they severed some fiber optic cables. It took out the cell phone network (and ONLY that network). I'll leave that there for someone to attempt to figure out.
