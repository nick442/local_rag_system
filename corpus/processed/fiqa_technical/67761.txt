Agree the hype is extreme. Still disagree that Denver is similar to Boise. Look at startup investment. Look at angel investor communities in Denver/Boulder vs Boise. Look at the general maturity of the economy. Again I agree it's hyped because incoming residents have been insane since marijuana went legal. But it's definitely a different town and economy then Boise in your example.
