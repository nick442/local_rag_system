in my experience, it's kind of how things are done in China, at least at the consumer level and probably a few steps above. For the most part it works surprisingly well, it's kinda like the street food vendors: even if they don't have as many health codes, it's really not in their best interest to make everyone sick. Same goes for doing business.
