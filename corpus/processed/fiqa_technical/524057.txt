It also depends on the firm that you work for. Some firms pay out overtime to their employees in the form of leave or cash. Either way, it is an additional cost to these firms to have their employees work overtime. Hence, you are less likely to work over and above your given work hours. Those financial firms that don't pay out in overtime and have a large client base will generally make you work like a bitch and compensate you for that via your yearly bonus.
