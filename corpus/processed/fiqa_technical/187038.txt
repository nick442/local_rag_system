Costco is great, and more companies should be great. Everybody is about squeezing every last bit of profit in the short term. Part of the problem is that executives aren't judged on the success and health of their companies, but the short term profits they can generate. When the company has been sucked dry and dies, they just move on to the next opportunity to gut and destroy value. The last few decades of HP is a great example, and now that Mayer is finished stomping out Yahoo's last breath, rumor is she might get the opportunity to do it at Uber. Costco pays its employees a living wage, doesn't fuck the consumer, and doesn't allow the company to be sucked dry by executives' payouts.
