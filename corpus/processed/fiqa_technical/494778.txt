All I'm saying is, if you're a person of color, if you're queer, if you're a woman, if you're not a christian, the hatred they're spouting isn't abstract or theoretical. It is directly targeting you and your loved ones, and they want people like us dead. Allowing internet companies to censor ideas they disagree with may be immoral (though perfectly legal) but so is spewing hatred and calling for the deaths of anyone who isn't a straight white man. And honestly I will take any allies in this fight I can get.
