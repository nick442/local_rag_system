There've certainly been lots of problems with unions, but no greater than with the businesses or agencies they bargain with. There is constant push in both directions; getting rid of them will just allow companies to run roughshod over workers like they did before, and since legislation is as much a commodity as anything else these days, they'll just stretch or change laws that impede them if they're not stopped. They're not obsolete, because the need never goes away, because one employer or another is always looking for ways to exploit & endanger his employees to improve his margins. No, not all employers will do this; but not all unions are or ever were bad, either, and unlike unions, companies actually get a short-term competitive advantage from squeezing their staffs, which means bad actors have a significant chance of crowding out good ones. In the long-term, balance between labor & capital benefits everyone; imbalance looks good in the short term, but eventually blows up. Both sides will always seek advantage- it's their nature- so both sides need strong counterbalance. Labor was strong for a fleeting while, but now the pendulum swings back.
