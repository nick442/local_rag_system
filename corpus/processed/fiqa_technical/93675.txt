"Eh, for the most part US labeling laws are pretty good. There are exceptions, but most of the time there's a reasonable argument at least. In the above example, it would need to be ""made with 100% chicken,' as opposed to ""100% chicken."" That seems fair to me. Not that misbranding never occurs, because mistakes happen, and people do also break the law, but misbranding is taken seriously. Even with no safety threat that's still a type three recall."
