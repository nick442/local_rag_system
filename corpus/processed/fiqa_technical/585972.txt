That would be fair from the perspective of the company, but hardly fair from the perspective of the victims. At 855m, it values each victims data at $6 (as opposed to $500 for the $70B lawsuit). I don't know about you, but it takes a lot more than $6 worth of my time to fix their error, so I'd argue it is not fair to the victims.
