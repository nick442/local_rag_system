Doomsayers can just buy the 5x Short ETFs instead of the 5x long, see where it leaves them. People who don't understand leverage shouldn't be writing articles about them. 3 seems to be a valid point to some degree, but why should there be a cap at 3x for ETFs when you can get way more leverage with other instruments. I feel like these are the people who blame anything that qualifies as a derivative for 2008.
