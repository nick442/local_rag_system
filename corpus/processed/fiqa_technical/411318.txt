It's a map. I used it, I got lost. It's well catalogued just how bad it was at launch. Anyone in charge of something as important as a map should not be releasing something so obviously inaccurate. We're not talking a computer game here, we're talking navigational software. Their decision to release it in such a poor state exposed their lack of interest in accuracy. There is other map software out there that I trust, so I see no reason to take a risk.
