The roofing situation is clear. H2B visas distort the roofing labor market by reducing prevailing wages with lower-paid immigrant labor. This allows companies to offer products at unnaturally reduced prices. It would be unrealistic to try and run a business with local US-born labor, that's higher priced. If your competitors can hire low-priced foreigners, you need to do it too (unless you can somehow find locals at the same price/quality/productivity). If the H2B labor supply was cut off, then it's likely that no roofing companies could find labor for $17/hr. They'd have to raise wages, take fewer jobs, or go out of business. This would raise prices. Customers wouldn't be happy, but they'd pay the price because they need roof work done. All vendors prices would go up equally. This process may take time. There's a shortage. Prices go up. Wages go up. Jobs become more desirable. More workers get trained in the field, increasing the supply of labor. This occurs until the labor supply is back in balance. On a side note, this particular business owner sounds like they need better marketing. If prospects want low priced work, they're going to get low-quality results. If she wants to sell a premium roofing product, she needs to differentiate it from everyone else. No customer spends more money just to support someone else's employees. If she can only get penny-pinching customers, she needs to do penny-pinching work.
