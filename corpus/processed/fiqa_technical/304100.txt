> But I pretty much followed the procedure I was told to, its just I don't know why we wouldn't get the money back. First, you're in the wrong spot. Go to /r/personalfinance. Second, does it *really* make sense that you'd still get paid? If someone stole your wallet and bought something for $100, can you not go to the store and demand your $100? Or do you have to go and find the thief THEN get back *that* item and THEN return it to the store and THEN get your cash back? It's easier both logistically and logically to stop the payment going to the store, and have the store consider it a theft of their merchandise.
