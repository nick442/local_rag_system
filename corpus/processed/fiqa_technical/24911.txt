Gee. Wouldn't it be nice to have that Russian car market back again? And how about oil & gas field technology services (lucrative). If only there was no regime-changing US State Department led by meddlesome neocon Victoria Nuland on too long a leash together with such bit part players as ^the ^former ^US ^Ambassador ^to ^Honduras, everything would have gone along swimmingly. Farcical.
