">For IT departments internally billing is essential for managing expectations. Otherwise they are treated as an endless pool of free resources. It -- chargeback/internal billing -- can (and I have seen this in action) also work the opposite way; it can allow IT to ""tax"" other departments inordinately and continue to operate inefficiently. The devil is always in the details; and the chief problem with chargeback systems is when things are ""genericized"" (for example charging ""set rates"" to each department based on CPU count {regardless of whether one unit in one department is a high-power CAD station, or file-server, and the equivalent of a ""netbook"" in other departments} -- or likewise by the number of printers {regardless of type, charging a massive workgroup printer the same $500 per unit annual ""support"" cost as a label-printer that only cost $50 retail, etc.}) And likewise with the ""IT shouldn't actually charge-back labor"" -- you still create the ""endless pool of resources"" problem, just in the form of labor rather than equipment. Basically internal charge-back systems CAN function -- *if they are properly constructed, and PROPERLY adjusted to take into account different (and changing) costs* -- but far too many companies ""implement"" such a thing, and then let it fossilize (where it ends up creating the same kinds of unnecessary and troublesome distortions that it was purportedly put in place to solve)."
