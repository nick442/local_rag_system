>Which one is Citibank I literally *just* told you retard. >Those CEO's (including this prick) were responsible for it. No they werent. CDO's / MBS's are *not* from depository banks. The financial institutions that are responsible for the financial crisis are primarily Lehman Brothers, Bear Stearns and AIG. AKA 2 *investment* banks and an insurance firm. So as I've said, you don't understand the difference between a depository bank and an investment bank. You also have 0 idea on how a collateral works. And again, tax payers didn't lose a single cent. You're brainless.
