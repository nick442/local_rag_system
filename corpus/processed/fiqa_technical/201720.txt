This is the worst part as far as I'm concerned. I fault Congress, not Apple, for failing to halt expatriation; but the fact that all of that capital is parked in cash equivalents while the national and works economy recovers is unceasingly painful. Imagine if $117B of found capital went into munis, what effect that would have. Pipe dream, though.
