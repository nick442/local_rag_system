i think 150 hours of practice is enough for level 1, im taking level 1 in december and i have a bba in finance&investments, work on buy side for equity fund. while a lot of the material is conceptual, being in the industry i already knew almost half the stuff pretty well. the way i study is by consistently doing practice questions(this is key for level 1, make sure to get the schweser test bank and do all 4,000+ questions!) after every section going back to the start so i dont forget anything along the way. i avg about 85% score and have studied so far for about 100-120 hours. hope that helps
