I'd be surprised to hear that any of my colleagues have a difficult time explaining the basics.. I'd guess likely they didn't want to start down a long explanation, as explaining exactly what you do, for example, as an options trader, is very complicated. Sometimes I think explaining what you do in a concise amount of time is more difficult than the job itself. Trying to explain the specifics opens up a Pandora's box of questions to those who aren't familiar.
