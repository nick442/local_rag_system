> Why are you bringing in Hillary or Obama? Because if you are against Trump, you must(!) be for Hillary or the DNC or both. > My argument was that Mitch McConnell and congress killed it. Even if it's true, it's what Trump wanted, what he would have done, what he has done, and the GOP did it, for him. All this, despite the wishes of the DNC, Obama and Hillary. Am I right? yes or no? > How can I .. take President Trump seriously Because it seems that you are not opposed to anything that Trump does. Ok!!! Tell me of something that Trump did that you do agree to or do not like. Let's go this route!
