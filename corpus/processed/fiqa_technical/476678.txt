I took the exam and passed the first try. Although I did entirely self study with no exam prep course, I do not recommend that method. Dalton is the best option. It's very pricey, but they guarantee a refund if you don't pass. Don't forget that in addition to the Dalton fees, you will have the exam fee as well as if you pass, the CFP dues up front.
