Part of the reason things are so ramped up here is that we'll be under the total occlusion, and historically we have over an 85% chance of clear and sunny skies, making it ideal. A lot of people are banking on decent weather here: personally (it's in the mid 60s here today) I'm hoping for snow just to fuck with people.
