There is no way that someone on this site can tell if they overpaid you. So for the purposes of my answer I am going to assume that the company is correct that you got overpaid somehow. I think the answer is pretty clear if they DIDN'T overpay you. If they overpaid you then Yes you owe the money. Why would you think otherwise. If they underpaid you, wouldn't you expect that they owed you money? Why should the opposite be any different? Finder's Keepers isn't a legal defense in this situation.
