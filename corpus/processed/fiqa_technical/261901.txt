For those interested in projected social security shortfalls, solvency, and methods of reform, I highly suggest: http://www.actuary.org/pdf/Campaign_2012_Soc_Sec_120327.pdf http://www.actuary.org/pdf/SocialSec_Trustees_2011_IB_FINAL_060111.pdf The American Academy of Actuaries is a nonpartisan governing body of actuaries in the United States, and these issue briefs are relatively easy to follow overviews of the issues with Social Security. The thing I am surprised the OP article glosses over is that, while social security isn't going bankrupt by the author's definition, benefits will have to be instantaneously reduced by something like 24% in 2024 if we do not reform the program and allow the trust fund to be completely depleted. This is something we should be fixing now, not 2 years before this happens. Unfortunately, as is somewhat typical, the government will kick the can down the road because no one wants to be the guy that voted to raise the retirement age, reduce benefits, or raise taxes.
