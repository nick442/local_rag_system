"Wikipedia-level definitions are not an argument. You're also conflating terms you don't understand. Obligations issued by the US government are backed by the full faith and credit of the government, as is its physical currency. This is not the same as every electronic dollar in every bank account comprising the money supply. Money is accepted by convention, and by government fiat. Now, I know you don't understand the nuance of what I just said, so I look forward to your confused and strenuously mixed up answer, which will be a blend between whatever white knighting you can lift off a Money 101 website coupled with a C-level community college education. Hahaha but seriously thanks for letting me know about fractional reserve banking by simply elaborating on its definition. True insights there, my friend. Anyway, when a bank lends out money, funds above the reserve are created out of thin air. The bank gives you a whole lot of ""full faith and credit"" apparently by your understanding, and if you don't pay them, then they get your car, house, non-exempt assets in bankruptcy, etc. My point is that it is an exorbitant privilege which if thought about for more than two seconds, and without an authority-worshipping, boot licking attitude, is pretty fucked up. The reserve ratio isn't just about the assets kept on hand. It's about where the 100% of those assets come from. Ultimately they come from the Federal Reserve, and not even the Treasury."
