There is no limit on how much money you can bring into the USA, in Cash or through electronic transfer. You only need to be able to proof or convincingly show that you earned it legally and paid all potential US taxes that you had to pay. If you chose to bring it in cash, you need to tell customs when arriving (and again, be prepared to proof the legal sources). Wire transfer, cash in the suitcase, whatever you like. There is no tax for bringing the money, and the tax for making that money supposedly is already paid. Once the money is in the US, and earns more money, you will owe taxes on the gain (not on the capital itself, just on the amounts it increases by) I hope you understand that if you live in the US, and you have money anywhere in the world, you might need to report it to the IRS; and if your money makes interest anywhere in the world (including of course in India), you might be are required to pay US taxes on the gains. That is independent of your question; but if you don't do it, you are cheating the IRS, and they will ask this when you bring the money back.
