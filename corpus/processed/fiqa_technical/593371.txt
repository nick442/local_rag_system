finance is far from a useless degree, as a whole the business school will have one of the highest employment rates for your college and within that school finance/accounting/maybe some sort of business information technology will be the 3 highest employment and starting salary. You may not be driving an audi and wearing a nice suit while watching the market everyday, but a finance degree in competent hands will give you an extremely high chance at not having to work some retail or food job. Degrees don't equal jobs, not hard to major in finance or CS and get a minor in something related to the other. Not only doubles the job pool u can look at, but gives you a more specific set of skills that certain companies will be begging for
