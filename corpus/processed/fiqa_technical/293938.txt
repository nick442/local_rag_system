I read it. It's fair. But just because Mr. Buffett says that's not true, doesn't mean he's right. As you can see, he still isn't backing up claims with numbers. >Most of the evidence suggests they are semi-strong form efficient. But that's not even the case. It doesn't say markets are 100% efficient, it says they reflect all *available* information. Which they almost always tend to do, especially ensured with HFT. I think if you look into statistical analysis you'll find the trend 99.99% of traders lack access to any special information, making the markets effectively 100% efficient. Gains/losses are proportional to the amount of risk taken. >Now you've made a promise you can't keep, because I'm not very wrong. :) I was a dick, I apologize. I still believe it, however. Have an upvote for the welcomed conversation, though.
