What is excess supervision for you? I got assigned some tasks by my managing analyst, and I might ask one question per day about the task he is giving me. Most often something very specific and niche that I have no idea of knowing, such as what drives the economy of the debt collection industry, or maybe how do I build a model around some obscure regulation. I am interning in commercial banking, without commercial banking experience though.
