"I made my statement in reference to another user saying ""there is no indication of [uber tracking you pre and post ride]"" I said that the uber app having your location when its opened pre-ride as evidence that uber tracks your location post ride and pre ride You said it's not. So unless you want me to open up uber to show that it knows my location upon opening without me ordering a ride I'm not sure what you are looking for. In other words I stated that the sky is blue, you asked me to state why I think the sky is blue. Your repeated attempts at drawing some grand pedantic argument are intriguing though"
