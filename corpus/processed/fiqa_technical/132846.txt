">.. _why the fuck are the executives getting paid instead of existing obligations being at least partially funded_? Well, first of all, how do you define ""executive,"" and how do you differentiate between executives who had a hand in ruining the company, and those that didn't? Are you going to withhold the salary of the executive responsible for boring securities compliance, just because you're mad at the strategic business planning? Second, ""executives"" tend to be flexible, mobile, and have ""fuck you"" money. Turn off their salaries, and they'll just leave. I know Reddit has this fantasy where executives don't do anything but golf and drink all day, but you can't run a company with an empty C-Suite. Top management walking out the door would grind everything to a halt - *including* the pension plans and severance you're worried about."
