Shifting money from one person to another does not increase overall spending, and it definitely does not increase the amount of productive work done. New or expanding businesses create new jobs, and increase overall wealth. If rich people really sit on vaults full of cash, as you imply, it would have a deflationary effect, increasing the real wages of the poor. This does not happen, however. Rich peoples' wealth will either be spent, invested, or given away, the same as the poor do with their money.
