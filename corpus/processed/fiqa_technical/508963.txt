What I think or don't think makes no difference, what you are proposing would be a huge change for the world. It might have unforeseen negative effects because the way things often happens is that a new development makes it possible to do the job *completely* by machines, and here you are proposing to keep the remaining 10 people as virtual *prisoners* in a job where they would just sit there all day doing nothing, staring at the wall, but collecting a paycheck. Wouldn't they be happier at another job doing some high level task for which there was no computer replacement, yet, some form of pure mathematics?
