"Having worked in retail and spent a large portion of my life shopping in retail, I sympathize with the employees more than the customers. I don't think that Target Employee wants to talk to you anymore than you want to talk to him. The worst part is you, as a shopper, can avoid the ""bad"" employees, the Target dude..all he gets to talk to are the douches and idiots. All. Day. Five. Days. A. Week. And. Six. Days. A. Week. Between. October. And. January."
