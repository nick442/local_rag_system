"I always wondered that back in the days of the Microsoft antitrust rulings. This is just more of the same, ""Quit being so damned successful, Americans - I fine you a kajillion credits for, um, a rule we just made up!"" I sincerely look forward to the fireworks on the day that some company actually *does* say ""No thanks - You need us more than we need you; would you like us to leave, now?"". Sadly, this probably won't be that day (even though it's overwhelmingly true.. But hey, they could always use Bing!)."
