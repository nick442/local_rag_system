I still don't understand this, you have an option between two cars, they are exactly the same except for one is cheaper and has less battery capacity, that means the company who built it is making less money on the cheaper one, and you have the choice between the two cars. You could very easily just buy the more expensive one if you have the money then, or you can afford it now until you have the money later, always your choice. If you don't like it, buy the more-expensive bigger battery, not the cheaper car that costs the same net price after the upgrade. What's wrong with that?
