As a fellow well-educated professional I totally agree with you. It is rational for countries and people to do exactly what they do best at the most competitive wages. Economics tell us that this increases the size of the global pie. But it hasn't happened to us personally. reality is different vs a theoretical discussion. Sure the global pie may be getting bigger but that doesn't mean individuals aren't losing out locally. I honestly don't know what I'd do if my industry were suddenly automated or reliably outsourceable. Sure I'd be happy to retrain but as what? I'm interested in the next phase of human development will everyone work less? Will we have universal wages? Tldr trade agreements, outsourcing and automation are among the greyest of issues
