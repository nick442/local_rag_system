"Carly was the disaster that just kept giving. She was unqualified and had an undeserved sense of superiority. She was ""all hat and no cattle"", as they say in TX. What really grinded my gears was her propensity to promote hollow slogans in an effort to raise morale and, I guess, to establish a vision. She was widely despised within the company. In her mind, she felt all resistance to her was collective opposition to ""change"". In reality she was scorned for pushing idiotic change."
