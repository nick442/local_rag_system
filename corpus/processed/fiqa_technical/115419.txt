"> they want to lower the standards we have for goods and services Their avowed goal is ""regulatory coherence"" but its [not being done in a good way](http://www.ciel.org/Publications/ToxicPartnership_Mar2014.pdf), its an attempt to sneak through a [huge long long list](http://www.ttip2014.eu) of bad ideas that would not fly in any kind of light of day, and then make them permanent, with special [eternal entitlements](http://tpplegal.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/isds-domestic-legal-process-background-brief.pdf) for multinational corporations, so permanent that future elections can not change them, nor can states individually protect people, their laws would be preempted to the extent that unaccountable trade tribunals [can order huge fines against countries and states for merely doing their jobs](http://www.italaw.com/sites/default/files/case-documents/italaw3206.pdf), because they impinge upon new suddenly materialized ""rights"" as perceived by the trade agreements. Almost nobody knows they are doing this. often countries dont realize that they have lost their rights to determine their policies, and then countries usually lose. There are SO many problems I don't know where to begin. > in part by opening up public services to private business? Privatization often goes badly. They are hiding that and portraying privatization as the only possible future. Well at the beginning, the prototypes FTAs, NAFTA and GATS mandated the privatization of most public services in countries that signed them, with services (everything you can't drop on your foot) especially some of the add on documents to GATS. That was in 1995. It contains a ""standstill"" (they all do) which said that countries could not change anything if it was a move back towards public ownership and control, in the case of services, they frame that as bad, as a theft from businesses. So standstill typically says things like they can not create any new public services and [if there was any money involved in the market sector at all that it would have to be privatized](http://www.iatp.org/files/GATS_and_Public_Service_Systems.htm) in tiny steps. No going back to public services allowed. But of course, people dont know that and often don't believe it when told. For example, do you believe me when i tell you thats the reason US health care is so bad-? Can you see how and why they might lie about what they,, politicians, can do, can do about things because they want to win elections by promising things - like affordable health care- But also hide the ugly act [that they gave away the store](http://www.law.harvard.edu/programs/lwp/nafta.pdf) starting in 1995. The FTAs that we can read (the early ones) tried to do it by being undecipherable to non-experts- they are so complicated and ambiguous only a few people really know what they demanded, at least up until recently. Now they are top secret. Really secret. Only the 600 lobbyists have access. Now, a growing number of people, especially in Europe, seem to realize this is really scary and a red flag., but its not because the news was any help, its because of the net, the media - especially in the US, has been completely unhelpful. They dont cover this at all. TTIP is a huge controversy. But I have a feeling the worst one is TiSA, which has remained largely out of the news. Except for Wikileaks and the financial services chapter. Just one chapter is known. And its an old version. Now they want in TiSA to greatly [expand the scope of these FTAs to millions of service jobs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_pPqnbXpA4) in a huge number of countries. Countries want things, like the US wants to be able to charge more money for drugs and they want to force other countries to allow US companies into their markets, for example, insurance, or financial instruments, it seems that they are trying to deregulate banking when it should be re-regulated to avoid a repeat of the 2008 GFC. Another thing the US wants is to limit generic drugs and make it easier for companies to open factories, send contractors, etc. elsewhere. Its not always a good thing to open markets up to ""liberalisation"". In many cases, it could lead to substantial job losses, as it has in [Central America after CAFTA](http://citizen.typepad.com/eyesontrade/2014/08/central-america-crisis-belies-caftas-empty-promises.html)."
