It varies highly on industry, regulations and locale. Say you are a US based manufacturer of industrial products in Pennsylvania (as an example), you may only have 500 employees, but to be compliant with EVERYTHING, you might need 12 HR people to track everything, actually do all the required training, followup on the failures, file all the required paperwork for all the various regulatory and legal bodies they are beholden to, etc.. If you are service company out of Alabama that is the same size, you might have a LOT less to worry about and could outsource the entire thing for less than the cost of a FTH.
