In many cases, you can be temporarily out of pocket by significant amounts. Even if you then get the money back, there may be difficulties or consequential costs that aren't covered. For example your card gets cloned and maxxed out while travelling, leaving you without your most effective means to pay for necessities. You're left paying over the odds to withdraw cash on your debit card (if you can even get enough out at a time e.g. India at the moment) or you have to get money wired to you. At the same time you can't really protect your card number. You can't even keep your card in sight in some places, never mind protect against the card number being displayed/recorded locally by the card machine.
