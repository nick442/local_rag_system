Interesting stuff, but I'd want to know how it occurred to them to check for a Citigroup Bear Run. It sounds like they simply datamined for one case which fit their hypothesis. I'd also like to see (1) how other finance companies fared in the same period and (2) how many upticks were available to sell on.
