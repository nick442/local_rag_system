I would not remove the current social programs . I wouldn't keep the current school system in the States or Canada if I was going to do this either . Public tax payed schools and apprenticeship programs only . So not qualified would not really be an issue , there would be something . Not wanting to is actually kind of the point , since apparently according to the article most unemployed men really want to do just do drugs or it doesn't say so but I suspect stay home and play video games or both .
