Cancer is on a remarkably fast rise here in the USA. My step Dad, just had a tumor removed. My Father in Law just died from it. My Grandmother had a breast removed due to it. My next door neighbor is about to have his second tumor removed. People all around me have cancer.. it seems like it's killing everyone. But hey. you know, its a conspiracy thing to mention that it might be caused by Glyphosate or BPA, etc..
