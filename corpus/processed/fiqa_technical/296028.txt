> every instinct in my body is telling me that giving Washington another blank check is a really bad idea. In my minds eye I can see senators lining up with pet pork projects for their home states and it makes me physically sick to my stomach I can sympathize with that, but there's no shortcut around the ongoing hard work of governance. Tying our own hands financially doesn't make for smarter government, just less capable and more likely to drown when the water rises.
