Yesterday, there were a pair of shoes, a deer, and a bushel of apples in the world. Today, of those three things, there is only a pair of shoes and a deer. Your legal expertise might be able to find some kind of recoverable asset to get the shoemaker back his money, but even the supreme court cannot rule the destroyed value back into existence. The economy is poorer than it was before the fire, no matter how we move the loddars around-- the loddars are just markers for the underlying value of actual stuff, goods and services that are actually useful. Analogies are problematic because they are inaccurate, but as a half-measure explanation, you could imagine that the loddars are poker chips: - Four people down to play a game of poker, and each puts $20 cash into a kitty and takes out $20 worth of chips. - A freak gust of wind comes along and blows one of the $20 bills out the window. - Now there is only $60 in the kitty, even though we each have $20 in chips. As a lawyer, you might be able to identify some person who is liable for that $20 shortage, but as an economist, I see that this little economy is now $20 poorer, and no matter how well anyone plays, the total output of the poker play is going to produce less than $80 value. Now go back and pretend that the poker chips are instead cash currency, and the cash in the kitty is actual goods and services (again, analogies are problematic). You can move the markers around however you want, but but some part of the underlying value has been destroyed.
