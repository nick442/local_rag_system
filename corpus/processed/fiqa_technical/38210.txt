See, now you are confusing me. Is it one day or 4 years? :P It's cool. I'm just giving you a hard time. I'll be honest, I'm scared to death that my 401k is going to tank worse than 2008. Overall, I think the trends for the stock market are positive, but there are points where it hurts. I know my dad is close to retiring and he still hasn't recovered from 08.
