This article is almost as bad as Fox News, but I'd expect that from a SF paper covering gun companies. Let's stir up some controversy on what this firm is doing?! Are they trying to take over the world and arm all the evil-doers?! Well, no.. Are they really controlled by a super-liberal that will dismantle them to keep bad guns away from society?! Well, no.. Turns out it is just a smart play by a firm that sees an opportunity to make money. Now let's wrap it up with a story about a sweet old man that helped out his former employees. WAIT, WHAT?! How is this considered journalism?
