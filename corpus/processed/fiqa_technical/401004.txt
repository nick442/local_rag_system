Pre-finance major here and new to this sub. Quick background, I’m 18 and I’m starting school at the University of Iowa in January. My question is: what resources are out there that you would recommend to help me get introduced to the world of finance? Could be books, online courses, videos, etc. and could be on any subject within the umbrella of finance. Thanks in advance for any recommendations!
