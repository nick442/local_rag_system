In my personal experience, and from potentially a lot of data.. anytime people repeat something a lot commonly, especially when I hear it from primarily people that havent actually worked for the company, its probably accurate and not worth further research. Of course you sir are a truthful, honest and wise individual but nay what about that guy you dont like? Is he? Of course not! We dont even need the raw data or methodology. Further the earth is probably flat, everything in the universe revolves around that earth, and the tide moves in tide moves out you can't explain that. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
