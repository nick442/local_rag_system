I shop there b/c of Kenmore. For certain appliances and high-dollar items, Kenmore offers a quality product at a very affordable price point. My short-depth refrigerator w/ built-in icemaker/water dispenser is Kenmore and we saved hundreds of dollars over the next cheapest competitor w/ similar features. Our vacuum cleaner is a Kenmore. We used to own a Dyson and were unhappy w/ it's performance on carpet and bought a Kenmore that was about half the price we paid for the Dyson and does a better job at cleaning. We sold the Dyson in a garage sale. As long as Sears continues to offer Kenmore appliances, I will always think of them first when I need to purchase an appliance.
