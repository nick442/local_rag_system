>Because something is legal doesn't make it the ethical choice. You fail to demonstrate what is unethical about minimizing tax burdens. >corporations making huge profits using the infrastructure of the region Did the corporations have an option to refuse using that infrastructure, and instead provide their own or work with others to develop a competing infrastructure? >Keep in mind that these favorable tax laws were lobbied by corporations with the intent to avoid taxes in mind. You have failed to support any argument that there is anything wrong with minimizing tax burden. >If I'm walking behind someone and they happen to drop a $100 bill without noticing, I can certainly pick it up and put it in my pocket legally, but its hardly the moral thing to do. A more relevant example is if I order a pizza, have it sent to your house, then show up later with a bill for the pizza and my costs to send it to you, demanding you pay it. You never asked for the pizza, maybe you didn't want the pizza, maybe you didn't eat the pizza, maybe you don't like pizza, or don't like that kind of pizza. That I choose to send you a pizza does not obligate you to pay for that pizza.
