"I think that's the point. There's nothing wrong with the ""pink slime"", and ABC tried to make it sound bad for the ratings. It's hard to say which side is right in this kind of case. It would be a shame if news shows shy away from saying bad things about products, but it's also a shame if news shows report misinformation and pander to consumer fears just for ratings, and crush a legitimate business in the process."
