Have been an assistant KM at a chipotle, can chime in here. The higher prices for our food (relative to other restaurants that use GMOs and such) is only half going to being able to afford non-GMO food. There's actually a lot of other really good things that Chipotle does, like deep cleaning services, paying employees extremely competitive wages/salaries compared to other restaurants, and a real nice education assistance program for employees who are also college students.
