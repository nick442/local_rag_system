">There is no obvious reason why, even in a perfect world, we would go looking for a malleable, highly-conductive, corrosion-resistant metal as something to peg the value of our banknotes to. If this were true, why force citizens to use a specific central bank's paper money via ""legal tender laws""? ;) >I will leave it to others to argue over whether a return to the gold standard would be a good idea, but the argument has nothing to with the intrinsic utility of gold. I'm sure we can all agree that gold is a fine metal with many good qualities. Then what was the point of your post? If you don't want to use gold as money, I would never force you to use gold. It is the contention of the Austrian economists that there should be free and open competition in the money industry. Allow people to choose their money. Allow entrepreneurs to create systems to simplify the communication of prices across various monies. The root of the problem is force and monopoly."
