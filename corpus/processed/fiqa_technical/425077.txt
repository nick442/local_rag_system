This article is hot garbage. Airlines have profit margins of 1% or less. Pilot shortages are a more a function of the regulation of licenses, not greedy companies hoarding loads of cash. And the farming example? The farmers *have* hired employees. They're waiting on approval to enter the country. If anything, the examples the author provides advocate less regulation, not more. I guess you can spin facts how you want, but here, all you have to do is write the right headline and get upvotes from people who don't read the article.
