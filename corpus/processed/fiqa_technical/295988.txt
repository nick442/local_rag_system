There's an economic reason you don't want to tax income differently than capital gains. Capital gains are created by taking risk, and encouraging risk is encouraging entrepreneurial spirit, which as a country you want to inncentivize. However, after a certain amount of money is made via capital gains the rate should approach income, but never equal it.
