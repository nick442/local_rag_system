Are you kidding me? Now more than ever there is absolutely incredible TV available. Breaking bad, game of thrones, mad men, curb your enthusiasm, boardwalk empire, the walking dead just off the top of my head. Granted most premium shit is coming from HBO/show time/a&e but still. I find TV and miniseries to be much more fulfilling than movies, as there is way more time to develop the characters and plot.
