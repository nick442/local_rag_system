"No, the language in the Constitution is permissive, not mandatory. The *grant of power* to Congress is mandatory (shall), but nowhere does it say Congress ""shall/must"" etc establish a post office. The same clause also says that the government can establish post Roads, but those roads no longer exist, having been folded into other road systems. Must Congress also maintain a separate post road network? By your logic it must, but that is clearly an absurd result. ""Maintain"" is only used for the Navy, which was always expected to exist continuously. Congress can also ""raise and support armies"", language reflecting the expectation that there would be no standing army, but neither ""maintain"" nor ""support"" are used for the post office. Congress has the power to create the post office and post roads, bit it doesn't have to. It certainly doesn't have to maintain them. Nor is there any reason to think that establishing the post office and privatizing it is impermissible, since it follows the dictate of the clause. Even if it were unconstitutional, what is the relief? Who could sue who to have what done?"
