We spent 8 hours with you criticizing my post and feelings on a topic. Are you really going to get sand in your panties because you finally gave an opinion on something and it was easy to pick apart? You know that your opinion is based on a fairytale that has never successfully coalesced in over 10,000 years of human existence in any kind of size to be meaningful. We have literally millennia of different forms of government that we can pick through and learn from. And yet anarchy hasn't made it through any timeframe in anything but statistically insignificant small and short lived societies. You had to reach back to medieval times just to find one single relevant example.. But, yep, taxes and government are bad..
