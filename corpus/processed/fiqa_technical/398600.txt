The answer again is yes, you will still show profit. Let's assume a 35% interest rate to show you why. If you have $1.000.000 in net profit, that means your Profit before tax was $1.538.462. So if you pay yourself a $1.000.000 salary then your profit before tax is $538.462 and your net profit is $350.000. I hope that helps you understand.
