Maybe not, but I think the point ElBrad was making is that you chart a pretty tight relation to price hikes by barrel and price increases at the pump over time. Price drops by barrel aren't usually followed by a drop at the pump though, as it takes a while for competition to drive that down. So while it's good news that oil prices are dropping per barrel (for non gasoline uses), it's fair to be totally cynical about the prospect of a cheaper prices at the pump when you hear news like this. Watching that per barrel rate drop and knowing this means a nice cushy profit trough for Exxon always comes with a slight taste of distain.
