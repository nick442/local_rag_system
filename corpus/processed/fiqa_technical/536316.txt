It's possible to build your own website with WordPress but from my experience, most business owners don't want to bother with it themselves. Then there are the clients that use free tools like GoDaddy Website Tonight, etc. Yeah, those are the clients that eventually fold and go to a designer because the end result of what they built was shit.
