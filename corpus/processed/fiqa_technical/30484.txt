I know this will probably be met with derision but.. Get a job and save up the money for school. This has the benefit of not having a debt accrue that you will have to pay off after you get out of school. Take an entry level position in a field related to your study. Sacrifice your desires but take care of your needs. Anything left over pay off your old tuition and then save for future tuition. Also when you feel the money you are spending for college because you remember the hard work that went into earning it, you respect it more. If you get a position in the field you want to study you can look at how to apply those lessons you are learning. It will make your education more meaningful as well. If you do well you may have a good job to start out right out of college.
