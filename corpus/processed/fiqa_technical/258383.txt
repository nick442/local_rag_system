My biggest concern here would be internet access. Even though it's technically 'illegal,' we saw cable companies throttle Netflix when they felt threatened. Youtube still relies on Comcast/Verizon or ATT/Uverse to provide internet to people's homes. If they want to really accelerate this process, they should ramp efforts to get more cities integrated with Google Fiber.
