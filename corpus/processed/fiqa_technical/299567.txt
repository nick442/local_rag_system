The business may not have paid any direct tax towards profit. However it would have paid tons of indirect tax like Sales tax / Service tax on the goods / services rendered. The raw material that he has purchased from vendors [leading to demand] would have been taxed. The salary he has paid [hence employees paying personal tax] So essentially even from a loss making venture, the Govt has received enough tax money.
