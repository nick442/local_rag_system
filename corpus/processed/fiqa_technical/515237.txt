Maybe in front office. My wife has now worked for three big banks in various asset management roles and her current place (one of the largest European banks) just upgraded to Outlook/MS suites in 2016. Before that it was Lotus. The transition took a year and was horribly managed. Her whole department's IT consists of one guy supported by their Indian global centre which is (apparently) not very good. Similar horror stories at her last place, one of the Japanese giants.
