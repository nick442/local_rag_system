Yeah, it's going to happen a lot faster than that. Today we're starting to see the 2nd generation of modern electric cars becoming available at $35K price and 200+ mile range. It was only 7 years ago that the first generation started becoming available. If progress continues at the pace it has up to now, then by 2025 we might see the 3rd gen EVs appearing and I expect they'll have 300+ range starting around $25K. EV infrastructure is easy peasy to install. All you have to do is pick an electrician out of the phone book. Apartments, parking garages, and hotels will all have to start installing level 1 and level 2 chargers, if they want customers.
