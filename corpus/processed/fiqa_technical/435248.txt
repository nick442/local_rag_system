"Background: I live and work in a small city (250k) and want to work somewhere much larger (New York, London, Chicago, Sydney). Ideal job is something quantitative and related to programming/analytics in finance, though I have passed the CFA Level III Exam to show my interest in the field and currently work as a systems and database analyst (job title is ""Senior financial analyst"".) I have a Master's in mathematical finance but my work mostly relates to personal side projects. Questions: Short of packing up and moving, what is an effective way to network with people from these larger cities? Is there demand for quants and junior quants, or is there too much supply? Will I need to get a PhD to be relevant? Can I transfer my background or skills into another area of finance first to get the networking contacts?"
