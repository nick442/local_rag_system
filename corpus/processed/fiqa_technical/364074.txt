You linked to an article about 1 QUARTER in 2010 - >If companies pay their employees more for the same amount of output it will just drive up the cost of goods leaving us with the same shitty demand. >Also, how do you figure this? I figure this because it is the simplest economics. The cost of goods sold is based on 3 things 1 - raw materials 2 Labor, including associated costs such as payroll taxes and benefits, and 3 - overhead If #2 is increased with NO INCREASE IN OUTPUT the cost of those goods is going up.
