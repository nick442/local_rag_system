Hedge funds are typically just funds structured and operated in a way that make them exempt from various securities regulations, most notably the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. This allows them to operate freely of restrictions on traditional fund such as those related to management compensation, public disclosures, investor liquidity, and portfolio concentration and use of leverage. In order to achieve this, hedge funds are typically open only to a limited number of wealthy or sophisticated investors and are restricted in how and to whom they can advertise.
