"I focus on market research, which is both quant-heavy and quant-lite. Many times I can back up my strategy with numbers (""data-driven decisions""), but many times I just have to rely on qualitative findings. Obviously the most quantitative MBA jobs are in finance and management consulting. Probably the least is strategy, but then that's a skill that you either have or don't have."
