"More silly ""experiments"" For the 100000th time: Giving free money to any subset of the population will increase wealth relative to the portion of the population that didn't receive free money. Ergo, the experiment will appear to work for that subset. Likewise, giving free money to the *entire* population does not increase wealth relative to any other group in the population and will therefore not work. What have we learned? The uncomfortable and utterly obvious truth: That wealth is forever and always a measure of inequality and not a metric. The number is irrelevant. Down vote if this fact contradicts your philosophy and/or makes you feel bad. Or if you think basic income is a new idea,"
