"Think about moving the decimal point in a bunch of accounting software and price stickers. Think about getting confused, ""is that price in old yen or new yen?"" - not just immediately, but every time you hear a historical price figure. Think of the inconveniences. How many billions of yen would that cost the Japanese economy? It could be a lot. How many billions of yen would the Japanese economy save by enacting such a conversion? Because I doubt it's anywhere that much."
