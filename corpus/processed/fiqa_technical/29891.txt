Our compensation is pretty typical for a study like this. And, it's actually frowned upon by the IRB to offer too much, because it runs up against ethical concerns for coercion to participate in studies. Given the population for this study, of course, we also added the raffle for the Oculus Rift, as something that might actually interest people. And, along with the value of supporting research to improve financial decisions, we hope this is sufficient motivation for some people to enroll! (So far, so good!) In my experience, people have all sorts of reasons for participating in research. A lot of people who do our studies tell us that its just kind of fun -- and the small monetary compensation is a nice quantitative indicator of how well they perform. One related topic is Amazon Turk, where people do tasks for incredibly small amounts. Surprisingly, statistics show a very wide distribution of education and income levels for these participants. Honestly, I'm not quite sure why people sign up for that site. People just have all sorts of reasons for doing things. In sum: we're not embarrassed by the size of our compensation! But seriously, we really appreciate the feedback, and I'll definitely be sharing your comments with our lab director for the next time.
