YEARS ago, the then owner of my current company was out in the field with some of our salesmen. When our machine broke while they were on site, him and the salesmen fix'ed the machine right then and there. In their suits. He bought the salesmen new suits, and that customer is still our customer to this day. Customer service cannot be overstated in industry. Engineers have long memories for both those who left them high and dry, and those that bailed them out in a pinch.
