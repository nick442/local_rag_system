The Model 3 will probably be a great car but there are other options. I think most people are buying this for the name since we really don't even know how good it's going to be. I mean, they are making a really cheap Tesla S, where are they cutting costs? The Chevy Bolt has a ~~50%~~ 38km larger battery for practically the same price.
