Absolutely. I actually spoke with a man from LeBatts brewery about this story, he told me that it it was sheer luck that other breweries didn't end up using the combination of a specific clarifying agent and foaming agent which caused the snottiness. The rest of the brewing industry was also cost-cutting but through a combination of bad luck, not knowing when to stop, and a lack of testing, it was Schlitz that became a textbook example of what not to do. Today most new/changed products use test marketing to prevent this sort of nationwide debacle.
