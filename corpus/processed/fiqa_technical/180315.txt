I wholeheartedly agree with you that keeping whales in captivity is horrible. Sea World as an organization actually does quite a bit of good in the realm of marine biology and preservation, but this one big black stain just makes them look terrible. I really wish they would free the captive orcas (that are able to survive in the wild) and any remaining (old, injured, maimed, not viable in the wild) no longer used for shows or as attractions.
