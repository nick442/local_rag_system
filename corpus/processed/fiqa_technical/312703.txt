The Greece debt crisis started after the Global financial crisis. Let's say 2008 they were indebted with 103 % of their annual Economic Output ( GDP ). This rose to 175 % of GDP in 2013. Different reasons. * their GDP dropped about 1/3 from '08->'13 * economy based on olive oil and tourism was unsustainable * huge public service sector ( military and ministries) Greece could not be trusted to pay back loans, so the European Union had to jump in to be a lender of last resort. In the middle of this year, they finally offered the first tranche of treasuries. So they are slowly coming back to be stabilized. But Change is slow. They are still above 175 % of GDP in debt. They still have negative growth and they still need to rely on help from Allies. Now that the German elections are over, you might hear something about the crisis again. I think there is supposed to be negotiations about future aid for Greece. Greece already had substantial hidden debt cuts( extension of their bay back period and so on). But you since it is a political subject, you can only do so much till the politicians start to fear a backlash from their constituents.
