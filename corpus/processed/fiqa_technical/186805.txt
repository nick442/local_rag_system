>Conclusion >Covert operations organized and abetted by foreign governments have played a substantial role in the political and economic development of poorer countries around the world. We look at CIA-backed coups against governments which had nationalized a considerable amount of foreign investment. Using an event-study methodology, we find that private information regarding coup authorizations and planning increased the stock prices of expropriated multinationals that stood to benefit from the regime change. ***The presence of these abnormal returns suggests that there were leaks of classified information to asset traders.*** Consistent with theories of asset price determination under private information, this information often took some time to be fully reflected in the stock price. We find that coup authorizations, on net, contributed substantially more to stock price rises of highly exposed companies than the coup events themselves. >This suggests that most of the value of the coup to the affected companies had already been anticipated and incorporated into the asset price before the operation was undertaken.
