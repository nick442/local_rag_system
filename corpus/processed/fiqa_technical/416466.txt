"Not necessarily. Especially if your business model is founded on a free internet. Take Netflix. In the short term they might make enough in tax breaks to pay for the ""fast lanes"" that ISPs want to charge. But what happens when the ISP decides to just bar Netflix entirely, because they are a competitor? They don't even have to block them, they could just intentionally throttle Netflix to a degree where the service is unusable. So consumers are sitting there with crappy quality coming from Netflix, but that Spectrum app is expanding and streams just swell. That's where it is headed if net neutrality is killed. If Netflix doesn't see this then they are blind. And it isn't just Netflix either, it's any service that competes with an ISP's other companies. In order for these tech companies to continue to enjoy success, they need net neutrality. Or failing that, a legal requirement that all ISPs cannot have other businesses besides being an ISP. Or true competition in all marketplaces for high speed internet."
