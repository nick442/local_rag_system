Gentlemen, you're probably wondering why I've called you all together today. Edit: seriously, if what you said isn't sufficient (and it sounds like it should be) ask if you're needed for anything else, thank all parties for joining the call, say good day. You can let them know where to reach you if needed. Source: years of professional phone work.
