Took out a small loan to buy a brooks brothers suit and Allen Edmonds shoes after I graduated college (stupid? Maybe) but I wore it to my first and only interview & got compliments on how I looked. Ended up getting the job (large finance firm). I say if you can swing it, go for it. If not, any conservative suit that actually fits you will work. What you'll notice is that a cheaper suit that fits well is a lot better than an expensive one that doesn't. Good luck! Additionally, I just bought my second suit. Also at brooks brothers. I don't really have many clothes and I'm still building a wardrobe for myself. I know that most of my clothes will be bought at brooks though. Snobby? Maybe. I don't give a fuck though.
