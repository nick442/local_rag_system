"There are two ways that ""joint"" accounts work in most US states.. an authorized user or a joint tenant. For banks with older online systems, the first named user controls the online account. My wife and I have an account with a bank like this, and we use the account number as the username. Newer systems separate your identities from your accounts. If you are not married, you really need to be cautious about keeping money in accounts where you are joint tenants, as there are very real financial and tax risks associated with doing that. Once money is deposited into the account, you both have full ownership rights on the money in the account. Also, you can get into a situation where you could have a gift tax liability."
