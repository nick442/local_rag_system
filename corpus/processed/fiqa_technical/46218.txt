From Illinois. We have been racing to the bottom for years thanks to Chicago corruption and cronyism. Hell, our Attorney General is the daughter of Michael Madigan. He is in charge in Chicago and in the Illinois Legislature. She has not prosecuted one politician in 8 years for corruption. (Two of our former governors were sent prison for corruption by FEDERAL prosecutors.) She knows where the corruption is, but can't arrest Daddy. Funny thing. She was going to announce her candidacy for a Governor. She thought her Dad would step down from his position so she could run. He refused. Yes, I know he is her step-father, but she goes by his name and calls him Dad. She had to trash your election plans. Mickey doesn't care about anyone, but himself.
