You're aware there's no such thing as a cheap house in Jersey right? Rental values are listed in price per DAY to make them look less scary. Also, no, you couldn't. You pay tax in the country you are resident in and the States don't equate property ownership to residency; neither does HMRC. Interesting side note, in Jersey's neighbour Guernsey you can own a house but not legally be allowed to live in it due to the dual property market.
