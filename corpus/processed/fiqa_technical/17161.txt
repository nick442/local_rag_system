I think even the kids are experiencing franchise fatigue. Lego has been pretty tied to the big franchises with DC/Marvel/Star Wars taking up a huge percentage of their products. My son is getting burnt out on all those and really seems to be yearning for something new. We already have like 20 Lego batmen floating around the house, what's so exciting about picking up another?
