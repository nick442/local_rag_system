All the major American and British banks, with a couple of exceptions. The British government, despite its conservative ideology, is imposing stronger regulatory limits and even discussing 'say on pay' provisions for executive compensation. The US remains wedded to its allegedly free market leanings despite revelations that JP Morgan, among others, receives $14 BILLION a year in government subsidies. And the markets have made it clear that they dont just welcome, but demand government intervention, despite the libertarian rhetorical flourishes of the business lobbies. We may not see the confluence of economic and political policy until after the US presidential election but the widening gap between ideology and reality may hasten the end of that peculiar conceit.
