"haha I used to be the same way. But then I began to realize that these charts are somewhat intentionally vague so that the topic does seem more confusing and complicated, so then we're much more inclined to just say ""hmm ok, I guess they know what their talking about"". That's the beauty of numbers too; they can be manipulated and concentrated into certain way so that it helps to prove a thesis someone is positing. Unfortunately these charts often provide zero context to go along with it, so any real knowledgable investor wont give much thought to one set of charts, like the ones in this post."
