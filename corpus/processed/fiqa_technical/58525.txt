Just playing devil's avocado here, but if you can't stop smoking weed long enough to find a job then it's really your problem. Almost every job I've applied to has had a drug test, including office jobs. If you can't lay off the devil's lettuce for 2 goddamn weeks and maybe drink some fucking water then what do you expect? This is coming from a chronic weed smoker.
