">Wait, how is ""selling more cars"" equivalent to the ""peak of culture""? I fail to agree that American culture reached a peak 40 years ago. Frankly, I think I'd be pretty bored if I were thrown back to 1969, even though it seemed pretty exciting at the time. Maybe I should have said the peak of American society and productive business. You don't find it odd that the year when the most cars were sold in the US was over 40 years ago despite a doubling of the population? That means people don't buy cars as often as they are not as financially able to anymore. People with lots of money buy new cars, poor people don't. Google and iphones are all well and good but how many of today's business success stories provide valuable services to society? Fewer and fewer."
