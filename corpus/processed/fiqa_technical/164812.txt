I am not a lawyer. In the United States, this does not look like theft to me. If the seller acted in good faith, theft does not apply. It seems that the purchaser of the inventory is in receipt of stolen goods. These can be recovered from the purchaser (the police will assist). The purchaser then has some recourse against the seller.
