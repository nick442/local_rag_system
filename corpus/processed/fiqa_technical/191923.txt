I lived in Kosovo and I kept noticing houses in the middle of bum fuck no where. I asked my business mgr what was up He said the Mafia will use those houses to launder money. They build super cheap (its basically just a shell..NOTHING INSIDE..not even windows) So if you are ever in Kosovo and see like 10 houses in the middle of field with nothing around them, it belongs to the Mafia.
