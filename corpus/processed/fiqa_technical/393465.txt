The article reads like a piece from a lobbyist of the taxi industry. This article made me realize the opposite of what it was intended, that maybe most of the legislation that uber/lyft is defying is just bureaucracy (bloated laws to keep the taxi monopoly) this proven by its impending approval worldwide. What were the point of laws when every one that they are designed to protect stop following them?
