What you have exampled is essentially the Amazon paradox. Why would someone shop only in one place? Convenience, ease, familiarity, one credit card storage, etc. I have ordered an item from Amazon because of the ease and it has been shipped to me in a Wal Mart box. People do this all the time and is basically why there are marketplace sellers on Amazon.
