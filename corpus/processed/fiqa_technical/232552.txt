"Zuckerberg has been known to do lots of underhanded things to get ahead, and say a lot of things that make him look like a jerk. IE: screwing over a lot of people while first building the company, including friends and partners. [Calling facebook users ""dumb fuckers,"" for trusting him with their information.](http://gawker.com/5636765/facebook-ceo-admits-to-calling-users-dumb-fucks) He certainly doesn't come off as ""likeable."" He generally comes off as a pompous ass that doesn't care about anyone but himself. If you are interested you can do some googling to see why a lot of people don't like or trust him. However he probably isn't the worst billionaire on the planet, but regardless people are certainly not rooting for him personally if that makes any sense."
