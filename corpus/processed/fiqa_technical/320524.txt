For our company, we use Microsoft Enterprise E5 as it allows us to communicate easier, manage projects and information, assign tasks, etc. As there's only 3 of us it works well but comes at a cost of Â£30 each per month. As it sounds as though it's only you on your own you should check out Trello. We were using Trello previously but communication between us wasn't great on there and it got too cluttered way too fast. For setting personal goals and tasks it's perfect, especially as the basic account is free.
