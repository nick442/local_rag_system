There are 2 questions here; My father, an NRI, sold inherited land in India .. This transaction is taxable in India. As its inherited land, and assuming its Non-Agricultural, your Dad will have to pay tax on gains, 20% with Indexation and 10% without indexation. He wants to move the money to the USA, with minimum tax. How to go about it? Money can be moved to US, there is a limit on the amount that can be freely repatriated, the limit is more if the funds are being moved for investment, like property etc outside India.
