> I would dare say that in most cases, people end up paying more in taxes, because they pay it as regular income rather than LTCG. That's not how it works. There's no LTCG tax on Roth accounts. And on regular investment accounts you're taxed twice. You first pay regular income tax and then pay LTCG tax on any gains. The main advantage of 401ks is that you don't ever pay capital gains tax. You're only taxed once on the money.
