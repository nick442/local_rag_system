All you personal virtue folks need to realize that as students are crushed under every greater debt loads, in the context of flat wages and a mediocre economy BEFORE the next crash, it will harm the greater economy and you. No matter how awesome YOU are, students carrying trillions in debt will be folks who can't buy homes and spend a lot less on other things. Unless you work for a student loan lender, that can hit you too down the road. A bad economy is bad for all. The cost of University has spiraled out of control and to absurdly expensive levels, student debt is a society wide problem that will affect the virtuous and the repulsive alike. Get over yourselves.
