The only ridiculous thing in the article is the statement that taxes to try to keep down inequality won't do any good because companies will hire less. What bullshit. Taxes on the wealthy doesn't need to come from the companies alone, it should also come from closing ridiculous loopholes that only favour the rich, and a more progressive income tax system that includes all earnings, be them through wages or through capital gains. I really don't understand why $100,000 in wages should be treated differently tax-wise than $100,000 in capital gains..
