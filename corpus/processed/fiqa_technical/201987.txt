In addition to the reasons discussed in JoeTaxpayer's answer, consider that a 401(k) plan is run by an employer (though the details might be delegated to a plan administrator) and it is a headache to have to deal with ex-employees (including retirees) with whom one might have no further relationship once the employment has ceased. Pension plans in addition to 401(k) plans are a rarity these days. Hence, no RMDs need be taken while still employed past age 70.5, but after that, let's keep in touch at least once a year so that we can send you some of the money we are holding for you.
