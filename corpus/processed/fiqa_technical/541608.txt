Opening up a new bank account and converting all your Euro's to USD is not a bad idea in the slightest. It is certainly possible to do, however you most likely won't be able to get the spot rate for USD/EUR (http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=USDEUR=X). Even though you will get a worse rate, I would be much more comfortable with this than holding Euro's in the coming months.
