"But this doesn't mean you're not allowed to evaluate someone's political choice based on other factors and judge them by it. Your attitude sounds suspiciously like the ""anyone who doesn't like President Obama is racist"" kind of rhetoric we've seen in the past. Just as political decisions should not be criticized based on the single dimension of ""Democrat or Republican"" at the same time the ""why"" of a political decision *is* open to evaluation and criticism based on nonpolitical factors."
