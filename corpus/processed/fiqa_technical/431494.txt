First, I'd use an online tax calculator to figure out you total tax tab for the year. Then look through Circular E and figure out from there how much tax you should pay for the rest of the year and work backwards to calculate the number of allowances to get there. Two friendly warnings - Since you are doing this midyear, you'll need to repeat this exercise as we go into 2017. These next 6 months, you'll be withholding less than normal to make up for the high holdings so far. Second, a withholding is like saying tax/don't tax me on $4050. So in the 25% bracket, it's +/- $1000 in tax paid. You can adjust closer via the line 6 on W4 'additional withholding'.
