"From article: > Notable in the last example is the point that the choice isn’t so much between competent doctors and incompetent doctors. As in other industries where licensure doesn’t exist, the choice might be between high priced, extremely competent services, and lower priced, still competent services. I think many poor people would prefer going to a ""second rate"" but still competent physician with a cheaper price rather than going broke with an expensive one. Let's leave that choice up to them rather than forcing our opinion down their throats."
