"One thing I'd quibble on. There is mainstream exposure. You are probably correct that everyone isn't buying records. But from late 90's, non-existent to the availability now is a huge change. still not as common as groceries, or coffee. The awareness of vinyl's return is fairly mainstream. Like when society as a whole co-opts a phrase / word, like ""bling"" or etc. That doesn't mean grandma is ""street"" now."
