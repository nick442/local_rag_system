When you say financial planning do you mean like managing clients money? There are a universe of jobs at those firms, but i think of financial planners more like the client facing sales guys. You would need understanding of the markets and to be comfortable with sales and probably some sort of license which those firms will often foot the bill for. Probably not a bad option if you like sales. General organizational skills and presentation skills are important. Financial analysis is more data focused. You would want to demonstrate an ability to work with data and derive meaningful insights.
