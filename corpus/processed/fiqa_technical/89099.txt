I think we can both agree to these two assertions: 1) Utterly nonesensical amounts of waste exist in the federal government. 2) The postal service will never be closed or privatized. The government is going to keep funding it until mail volume diminishes to 0, and even then they will fight and clamour to justify its existence. The question is not where does government waste exist. I could punch out of work right now and fill your screen with example after example of feel good government projects that do more harm than good, and we both know it. The question is why. Why is government waste created and why does it persist?
