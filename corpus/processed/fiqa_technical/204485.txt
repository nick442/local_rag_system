"But look at the bright side. The Home Owners Association is telling your neighbor (for the low low fee of $200 every 4 months) to put his garbage can into his garage after every garbage pickup. Your house is worth a fortune, even if nobody is willing to buy the 12 houses for sale on your block (never mind the fact that they have been for sale for the past 2 years or the fact that nobody is willing to ""rent"" a place in butt fuck Egypt for $1500 a month)."
