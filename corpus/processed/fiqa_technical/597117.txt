You're welcome, good questions on a confusing topic! Let me see if I can unpack it a bit, try to clear up the way accrual accounting jukes and jives.. > I buy an airline today. I get to recognize the revenue from any pre-sold tickets starting tomorrow and reduce my deferred revenue liability.. Hmm.. Are you sure that's the case? Does purchasing the business somehow cause those future events to resolve? I could be way off base here so let me know if I'm missing something, but whenever an airline ticket is purchased in advance, it's a balance sheet issue. Cash is increased and there is a liability created for Deferred Revenue. The revenue hits the income statement only when the flight takes place. As you noted, this would be accompanied with the usual trappings of costs and expenses, etc. > However, I don't get that cash as it has already been paid to the previous owner. Sure you do! Their bank account is now yours, right? I imagine that buying an airline company would be a matter of transferring ownership rather than to resolve any underlying uncertainty in the recognition of earnings, yeah? As for valuation, it may depend on if you're looking at the income statement in isolation and relying on EPS or if you're using a more integrated approach with the balance sheet, which would bring these sorts of developments to light. Does that help? Any part still clear as mud? EDIT: words
