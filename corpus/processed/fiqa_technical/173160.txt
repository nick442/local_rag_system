Oh, I agree that it is very likely to increase how often people go to the movies. I just don't know that, at the $10/month price, it's likely to be profitable for MoviePass.. I think the big difference between my evaluation and MP's of the strategy is that MP thinks it will eventually have enough leverage to get a share of concessions from theaters. Based on the economics of the situation and the fact that theaters ultimately have more leverage, as well as in-person access to theatergoers and MP customers -- plus the theaters history of specifically not doing what MP hopes they will do -- I think that's a hell of gamble. **Edit:** Movie theaters aren't losing at all at this point because MP pays most of them full retail value for every ticket - they'll do very well. I just don't think they're going to ever, essentially, give MP a cut out of the goodness of their hearts.
