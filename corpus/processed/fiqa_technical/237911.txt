"Your comment is more related to economics rather than finance. You're right that with conventional, everyday goods that ""value"" is an entirely subjective thing. Economists formalize this idea with the notion that people's preferences determine market prices. In finance, though, ""fundamental value"" relates to the value of the cash-flows produced by a financial asset. In Marxian terms, we're talking about exchange value - what can I get if I take this bond/stock and sell it. The value I get should be equivalent to the monetary value of the cashflows produced by that asset over time, discounting for uncertainty, etc. So, ""fundamental value"" is a bit more objective in finance since these things produce something quasi-objective - cash."
