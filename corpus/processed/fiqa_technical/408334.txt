A sure-fire way to make money? Hell no. There are tonnes of scams and money grabs out there, not to mention the fact that most ICOs are based on projects that are going nowhere. Having said that, there are many ICOs each month that will do very well in the future. The best thing to do is to shortlist a number of projects you like the sound of and then sit down and research each of them. Some of the key things to look out for, aside from whether you think the idea is a good one are: The team. Do they have a proven track record? Are they reputable? Is what they claim provable? Google team member names and check to see if they have a legit Linkedin profile. The Whitepaper. Is it clearly worded without spelling and grammar mistakes? Does it have a well defined roadmap with provable achievements to-date? The ICO format. How much are they looking to raise and is it a realistic figure? Are unsold tokens burnt? Is there a maximum contribution limit per investor? What does the competition look like? If they are first to market then this will make the startup way more attractive. The above are probably the most important things to consider though there are many other things to investigate. I have written a fairly comprehensive guide to all the things I look out for when analyzing the investability of an ICO.
