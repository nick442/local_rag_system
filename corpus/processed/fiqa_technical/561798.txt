">Now if we convert the average income in 1965 into today's dollars we get an average salary of $32,000. Pretty low, right? Well today, in the year 2012, the average income is somewhere around $43,460. Which means that over almost half-century the average income grew by a mere 35%, or only $11,000. In some ways it's actually a lot worse than that: ----- The numbers you cite are GROSS *average* income. First of all the ""average"" part is a problem since outliers greatly affect it, one ought to be looking at *median* income. And second the fact that it is *gross* income (before taxes) rather that *net* income (after taxes) -- this is really critical when you look NOT at ""income taxes"" but rather payroll taxes and the rate changes over the years. While in 1965 the payroll tax was all of 3.65% (total), it was essentially doubled to 7.65% by 1990 (and actually 15.3% if you include the ""employer contribution""). And of course many other taxes have increased (as *percentages*) during those same years, back in 1965 sales taxes were either minimal (say 1%) or non-existent; whereas now most states tax sales at somewhere between 5% and 10%. But at the same time.. it is actually a lot BETTER than the raw numbers make it seem: ----- Counteracting that, many goods -- especially electronics related -- have (continued to) become cheaper (even in nominal unadjusted dollars) and in conjunction with that lower price, much more widely available. In part that was due to continued productivity increases in farming and manufacturing and lower (in *real* inflation adjusted terms) cost of energy, plus of course integrated circuits and computers dramatically improved efficiency of operations (in everything from the fanciness of CAD to the mundane aspects of tracking & controlling inventories). So all hail to farmers, to oil, and to ""Moore's Law"" else you probably wouldn't be able to afford a color TV (much less a computer, video game, DVD player, and many of the rest of the relatively affordable ""amenities"" {including non-electronic things that have been made cheaper and more widely available due to the USE of computers in business & industry} that make life today more enjoyable than it was circa 1965)."
