I switched to a credit union for a year and the only complaint that I had was that the service was absolutely horrible when compared with my previous bank. Flow time in the drive through and help when going inside were pretty bad. The credit union was UFCU, has anyone else experienced this and switched back to their old bank? I realize that many people can do almost all of their banking online, and that credit unions probably benefit those people. But, for those that need to go to the bank several times a month I wouldn't recommend it. I switched back for this reason.
