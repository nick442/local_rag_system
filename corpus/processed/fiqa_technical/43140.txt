"Teavana's product was always vastly overpriced and relatively poor quality. We drink a lot of tea in our house, and occasionally some well-meaning person would give us a gift certificate for Teavana. Invariably, it would cost $50 for what should be about $20 worth of tea, and even their basic blacks (which should taste like *tea*) tasted like a perfumey, herbal mess. When our local Teavana opened, I worried about our local tea shop's business. After I drank a cup of their tea, I stopped worrying. Probably my biggest complaint about Teavana is that think that they've tried ""good"" tea and don't like it, but what they've had is Teavana, and it sours them on actually trying some nice teas."
