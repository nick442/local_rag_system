I'm a PE, what the fuck are you to be talking about zoning laws? Where does your insight come from on policy? Your sophomoric spamming of this thread screams libertarian blog level education, you a CATO fan? Hahahahaha, listen here you punk kid, you lost. Now go cry in a corner somewhere else, adults are talking. What you describe cannot even exist in the real world, your ideology is incompatible with reality. Your knowledge of economics is the same knowledge astrologers have about the cosmos. It is embarrassing watching you trot out the same sad talking points that have been dismissed for decades upon decades like they are fresh new and exciting.
