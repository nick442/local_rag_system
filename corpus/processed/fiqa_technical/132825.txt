Realization is when you actually have something in hand, it isn't just theoretical anymore. For instance, you may win the lottery, but until they hand you a check, you haven't realized the windfall. Another example is that you may be paid a particular hourly wage, but until you cash the paycheck, you haven't realized the pay.
