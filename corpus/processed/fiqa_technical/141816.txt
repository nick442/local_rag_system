Just agreeing with you. Most of our debt is owed to ourselves, and through monetary policy we are much more fortunate than other countries to have these controls. I feel bad for the euro zone where it seems Merkel's politics > European economy.. but then again if i was a German I wouldnt want to open my wallet to save a Greek either.
