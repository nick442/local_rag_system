What are you talking about? There are plenty of slaves who taught themselves to read and successfully hid their efforts from their owners. Hell, others decided to just leave. These slaves pulled themselves up by their bootstraps and were examples to other slaves. Clearly there is no context, environment, and system that people exist in.
