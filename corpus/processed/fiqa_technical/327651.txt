"Appears to be a hypothetical question and not really worth answering but.. Must it be explained. no, not until audited. It's saying that for everything reported on a tax return, people have to include an explanation for everything, which you do not, unless you want to make some type of 'disclosure' which is a different matter. Must it be reported. Yes, based on info presented. All income is taxable unless ""specifically exempted"" per the US Tax code or court cases. Gift vs Found Income.. it's not 'found' income as someone gave (gifted) the money to him. Generally, gifts received are not taxable and don't have to be reported."
