">I should never have to specify the flavor for the love of God. I was just ranting about the same to friends last night, but the ""chocolate"" Frosty is still just as good as it was a decade ago. As to Arbie's I don't know what horsey sauce is, and I guess.. I'm afraid to ask. We don't have a lot of 'em around here & the few times I've been to one (like twice) I got food poisoning.. so.. McDonald's: * Fries go from meh to grossly over greasy. * Burgers are just not good. * Chicken strips or chicken snack wraps are eatable * Generally I avoid McDonald's * The fudge sunday's bring back happy childhood memories though."
