Granted this is an article on Argentina's debt but something that is not mentioned here is how Vulture Funds work. It is my understanding that Vulture Funds purchase debt which is considered weak or on the verge of default at discounted prices with the sole intention of holding out on the debt and blocking any settlements until they can get significantly higher payment on their bonds than their original investment (plus interest on the amount plus profits). Essentially, then Vulture Funds sole purpose is to profit off financially distressed debtors. So the court is ruling that all the shareholders who agree to the payout must wait until those shareholders that do not agree to the payout are accommodated (those shareholders who bought their debt cheap from debt holders that wanted to sell and get out while the getting out was good). So much for the concept of risk or investing into the project, that speculators and financiers tote out whenever they want to describe the benefits their activities bring to the economy?
