No, you don't. Self made means you didn't inherit your money. This person did not inherit his position. He did not inherit his money. He is earning it. He has had some advantages, but that doesn't make him not self-made. If having an advantage means you're not self made, then when would the cutoff be? Would it be a certain level of wealth? But what about all those people in Africa/India/China? Surely no one born in the US faces that level of hardship, so then no one in America can be self made. Sorry, Oprah. Ok, so within the poorest of countries, there are still disparate levels of wealth. Surely Dinesh who was born to a destitute family in a rural part of India has it tougher than Vijay, who was born to a lower middle class family in Mumbai. Hm. So to not have an advantage, we've now restricted ourselves to the absolute poorest people from the poorest countries. That is literally the only group of people who could be 'self made', because anything else would be subjective.
