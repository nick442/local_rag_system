Several things may be the cause. The person who clicked with you may be side lined in the hierarchy. You missed something basic in the entire presentation, maybe you should have picked up or said something about this being similar to X industry or what not. (Not saying you didn't, but pointing out that there is a lot of different reasons as to why it could have happened) The interviewer could have been a tool There was another better candidate. The usual admonitions apply, this is the same advice I give close family members when they get dinged - 1) You are doing the right thing in analyzing it 2) If you can't figure out something to improve on soonish, stop chewing on it. Its quite possibly that the answer will pop into your head once you've had time to distance yourself. Or the answer could be pointless to obtain. 3) Getting in is usually a numbers game - keep at it. The fact that you are focusing is a good thing. You could always try the good old: - Thank you for taking the time out to interview me. I respect the decision taken and regret not being able to join a firm that I greatly respect and admire. If possible, would I be able to talk/meet with you at your convenience. I usually frame these things better, but right now, personally not feeling that confident about sending such a mail so its reflecting in the language. The reason I am suspicious that such a mail won't work is because it sounds you came through the generic recruitment barrage for undergrads - and lee way there is few and far between. All the same, you said you managed to connect positively witht he first interviewer, so adapt and target this at that conversation, put it into your voice and send it to him/her. Thank them for their time, appreciate the effort, and ask politely and with confidence if you could have some time to understand their thought process. You wont get into that firm , but you will make a contact if all goes well. And thats worth a lot.
