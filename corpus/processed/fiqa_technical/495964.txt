It's not just salary. I went through university during the dot com bubble and graduated in 2002 into a brutal job market. Programmers took it in the chin during the recession, especially in the areas that now have high demand again, and then suffered through a decade of outsourcing fads where programming and IT were the number one targets. CS enrolment at almost every university plummeted, often by 50% or more. It's only been in the last few years that the job market for programmers has recovered, and only then in very specific regions. Is it any wonder that people are still gun-shy about going into CS? The current demand for programmers is largely driven by bubble investment in social media startups, which is itself driven by huge amounts of capital looking for high returns in a post-2008 environment of low interest rates. It's not hard to imagine another collapse and a return to the mass firings and outsourcing of the early 2000s. Not to mention that the average career in programming is something like fifteen years.. The athletic analogy isn't a bad one. It's a good paying job right now, but there's an insane amount of risk and stress involved in being a programmer at one of these high-paying companies.
