"Glancing through that link, what exactly do you want me to read? The changes to inflation under Clinton were made to made to more accurately account for inflation, so if anything things are more accurate now than in 1950. The precise details of the changes are documented on the BLS website somewhere, but the short of it is that the old inflation definition had the problem where if prices went up (or down) and then back to original, you would still have inflation, which is incorrect. The changes lessen this effect. Many independent groups like the billion price project agree that the current BLS methods for measuring inflation is more correct than the older methods and match actual pricing better. Note that the billion prices index does not include hedonics as far as I know, and in practice the amount of goods to which hedonics applies in the CPI basket is so small as to not matter much anyways. Finally, the idea is sound - one should account for improvments to products as adding value, so comparing a 20"" TV from 1970 to one today needs more than merely retail price to evaluate price increases - onc certainly gets more TV than back then. If you have claims otherwise I'd like to hear them. Until then I suspect we more accurately measure GDP and inflation than in 1950, not less accurately. All this still does not show there is more ""fudging of the numbers"" than in 1950 and the poster above you said. It seems he's making excuses to obtain an aswer he desires, rather than the correct approach which is to measure carefully and then think what it means. And no one here said GDP was a universal measure of economic health."
