When you say that you are not sure 'what amount of money would make a difference in the future', it indicates that you have not clearly identified your long term financial goals. Consider monthly budgeting to be one of the stepping stones to long term financial planning. How much you can 'afford' depends not only on your savings and income, but also your future expenses. If you want to buy a house in 2 years, for example, you may want to scrimp and save just a little longer, to secure a larger down payment. If you want to retire early, then similarly saving money now should bring you not short term financial wealth, but long term security. How much you can 'afford' will depend on how your current financial situation matches up with your future goals. The rules of thumb you listed (ie: % of income) may be good starting places, but that doesn't mean they are the right answer for you, in your current situation.
