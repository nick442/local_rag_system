Zoning laws with no urban planning? Completely private infrastructure? Hahahahhaahahahahhahahahaahahhahaahha, you have no fucking clue what you are talking about. I have worked in civil engineering for 20 years, what you describe would turn American sprawl into SE Asian slums over night. India has more zoning laws than the US including a whole crap load of religious ones we don't have but everyone just ignores them because they have a weak federal government, which is what you favor. The real world disagrees with your ideology, change it.
