I'm not a Millennial, either. I was born right in the middle of Gen X. I don't hate Applebee's, but I don't eat there, either. There are a number of small mom and pop restuarants in town. The cost of eating at those is roughly *half* of a meal at Applebee's, and the food is usually better. Further, I recently bought a house and have upgraded the kitchen, so I will be cooking for myself much more often. Homemade meals are about 10%-25% the cost of Applebee's. Quality is much higher, too. There are two problems with Applebee's. One, too many grasping hands. IIRC, Applebee's is a franchise. That means the franchisee, corporate and shareholders are all squabbling over their share of the profits. That leads to cuts in product quality and underpaying employees. That's a recipe for disaster. Yes, I believe in profit, but the profit should be going to only *one* entity. Otherwise, you start crapping on product and employees, which suppress profits. The other problem is complexity. How many items are on the Applebee's menu? Probaby 80-100. I haven't counted. That's too many. They need to get it down to 15-20 items and go all out to make those the best possible. If they had a more limited menu with higher quality items, the employees were better paid, and the prices were lower because only one party collected profits, they'd be doing well.
