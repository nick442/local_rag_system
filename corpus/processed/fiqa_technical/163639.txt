>As a boston resident, these stores will be jam packed this weekend. The store i go to has 20 lanes 5-6 customers deep from opening on friday to close, and it looks like that almost every weekend day. Which is one of the top criticisms of Market Basket. If they are smart, they will overstaff this weekend as they have a chance for new customers. If there are 15-minute waits to checkout, they won't win over new customers at all. MB shoppers are slightly lower SES than the overall population, but that is primarily due to the lower prices. We'll see what their weekly sales look like for the upcoming months, and I won't be shocked to see a slight change from where it was previously, be that higher or lower.
