"I really think the switch to ""digital"" was a big contributor (not that it wasn't trending that way already anyway, but the switchover certainly didn't get MORE people to watch). I know in my location (rural, about equidistant between three major cities/TV markets) the reception sincerely sucks. One result was that I went from watching minimal TV to basically watching none at all. Plus I think the economy has forced a lot of people to rethink things like Cable TV and/or Dish services and the like -- and many more people are deciding that it just isn't worth the cost."
