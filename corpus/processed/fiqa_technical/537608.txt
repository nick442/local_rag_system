Which is just one metric for assessing how well a country is going. A great example of this is if you compare Portugal and Equatorial Guinea. They both have very similar GDP, but most of Guinea lived in third world conditions, with on decent education system, no justice system, poor infrastructure, etc.. How do they have such a high GDP? Oil. Who does that go to? Ruling family..
