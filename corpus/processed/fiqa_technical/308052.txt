That's about right. I know a friend of mine who took a redundancy package after working at a firm for forty years. He got four weeks pay for every year he worked, and then a lump sum along with his finally salary pension, as he was two years from preretirement age anyway. He walked away with about Â£250,000 by the end of it all I think.
