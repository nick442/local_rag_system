"I think that pattern is impossible, since the attempt to apply the second half would seem to prevent executing the first. Could you rewrite that as ""After the stock rises to $X, start watching for a drop of $Y from peak price; if/when that happens, sell."" Or does that not do what you want? (I'm not going to comment on whether the proposed programmed trading makes sense. Trying to manage things at this level of detail has always struck me as glorified guesswork.)"
