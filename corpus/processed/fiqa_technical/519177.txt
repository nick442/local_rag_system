[Here are the three main temperature sets](http://i.imgur.com/8LGxyOR.png). Pretty hard to claim there's been no warming. Fun fact: for any trend to be relevant for climate, you need at least a 30 year period. What you, and your denier sources are doing, is deliberately preying on ignorance of the basic science to present a misleading and wrong argument. It's like taking 30 minutes of DOW activity and claiming that the market's obviously going to be up/down/stagnant for the rest of the year. You're deliberately (or ignorantly) confusing short term variability with a long term trend.
