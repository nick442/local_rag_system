I get that, but do boats depreciate at a much faster rate than a car, for any reason? That was the impression I got from your comment. Funnily enough, I was in a meeting today where someone said you have two happy days with a boat; the day you buy it, and the day you sell it. Hah. Watching my dad, a boat seems like a complete pain in the ass as an investment. Far too much maintenance for the actual time you get to use it, and constant, regardless of whether or not you use it at all (unlike a car, which can sit in a garage without major issue for a certain amount of time), and then the mooring and gas are all costly, too. I just wanted the rationale behind a boat being a shitty investment, really.
