"Or here's a better idea: don't have a credit card at all. They offer no real benefits and plenty of dangers. Don't take my word for it, though: ""I tell every student class I get, high school students, university students, you know, they'd be better off if they never used credit cards"" - Warren Buffet (Net worth: $44 billion) Before anyone says anything about using credit cards ""wisely"" and getting the rewards points, I can save 15% on many kinds of large purchases ($100+) using cash. You won't find a reward system offering that level of incentive. Two recent examples of cash discounts: After I bought my house I needed a lawnmower and a my wife wanted a new vacuum cleaner. Went to Lowe's and found the ones we wanted. They were $600 combined. Found the manager, stuck five $100 bills in his hand and said ""this is what I have, and that is what I need."" 16.6% saved. Bought my daugher a bed recently. Queen box spring and mattress were on sale for $300 but it didn't come with the rails, which they wanted $50 extra for. Went to the bank and got $320 in cash from the bank, walked in, set it in his hand and said, ""I need the bed box spring and rails, tax included."" He replied, ""Sorry man, I can't. I'm already taking a loss on.."" Then he stopped mid sentence, looked down at the cash again and said ""Hold on. Let me ask my manager."" Manager walks over, guy explains what I said, manager looks at the cash and says ""Make it happen"" 14.3 % saved. As for purchasing a home, it is a myth that you need a credit score to obtain a mortgage for a home. Lending institutions can do manual underwriting instead of just relying on your credit score. It is a little tougher to do and banks usually have stricter requirements, but based on the information the OP has given in this and other questions, I think he can easily meet them."
