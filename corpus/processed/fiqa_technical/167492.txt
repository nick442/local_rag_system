"They say that banks earn 4 - 5% on deposits, so with lower costs they can give away 2-4%. They cite [this article](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-banking-industry-annual-profit-hit-record-in-2016-1488295836) which says that ""return on equity [for banks] up at 9.32%, the highest level since 2013"". But [net interest margin](https://www.fdic.gov/bank/analytical/qbp/2017mar/chart4.html) is lower (2.5%-4.5%). And that's in a good year. They elaborate in a blog post: ""Fed Funds rates are supposed to affect deposit rates that banks pay to their customers, as, after all, deposit is a form of short term loan from depositor to the bank (see the explanation in our recent blog). However, as WalletHub notes in their recent report, it has not actually happened recently. As the report notes, for traditional branch-based banks, savings and checking account rates are virtually unchanged. You are probably getting the same 0.01% in your checking or savings account? Meanwhile, rates on your credit card went up by 0.53% since December 2015."" ""So why aren’t deposit rates increasing? One reason often cited, is actually the relative decrease in the levels of competition in the U.S. market (as we described in our earlier blog). While there are still thousands of banks in the U.S., 4 control ~40% of the assets and close to half of the assets (loans). The other reason could be, perhaps, that after almost 10 years of getting close to zero in your bank account, you will forget that it could be any different. In fact, bank executives are puzzled why consumers are not “demanding” more on their deposits. You can walk to the branch and “demand” more money from your bank, but you may end up in county jail. The only other viable option is to take your deposits elsewhere, or vote with your feet.""
