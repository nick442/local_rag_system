We have a lot more immigrants that come here for an education. Something like 70% of grad students in stem fields are foreign born. Those people are being turned off by Trump. That’s the problem. H1Bs aren’t the people who Trump is turning off. That’s not the problem. The problem is these other people who come here because they’re brilliant and the us has opportunities for them. Trump is turning them off. They can go to grad school in Canada or Europe because the prospects when they finish will be much worse.
