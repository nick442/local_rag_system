"It's not a cure, Hollywood is a cancer on artists. They want to control all art because sometimes, artists have something important to say and that can bring about scary change. Change is hard to control. and it's not ""pirating,"" it's a solution to an efficient distribution method. I haven't payed for a movie, theater tickets, DVD, etc in years. When I buy books, I buy them from small publishers. Sure, I can't shoot the shit with my co-workers about the latest [Batman propaganda](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq0GRCkegDM), spinning our wars as some kind of epic justice, but that's a small price to pay to have a lot more money in my pocket at the end of the year."
