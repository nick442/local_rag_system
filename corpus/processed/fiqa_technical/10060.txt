Really? You think this is all on the developers having their head in their ass? Do just a little bit of research and you will see why developers are building expensive homes. Since I know you won't research a damn thing, I'll share it with you- Permits, licenses, taxes, fees are absurd. Many of these are assigned and voted on by the local government. If developers were able to make a profit on homes less than 225k, they'd be building them faster and more frequently than you masterbate.
