Look Japan is a completely opposite country to pretty much every other country in the world. So there is like no way to compare them. The most I could say is that people typically work an amount of hours that works for them personally so there is no issue like are they working to long or not long enough, unless you have something like a situation where people are struggling to bring food on the table. That happens from time to time but not in a bad way
