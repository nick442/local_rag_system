I can do better, I can show you [sources](http://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/qanda_religion.html): > Religious Organization Exception: Under Title VII, religious organizations are permitted to give employment preference to members of their own religion. The exception applies only to those institutions whose “purpose and character are primarily religious.” Factors to consider that would indicate whether an entity is religious include: whether its articles of incorporation state a religious purpose; whether its day-to-day operations are religious (e.g., are the services the entity performs, the product it produces, or the educational curriculum it provides directed toward propagation of the religion?); whether it is not-for-profit; and whether it affiliated with, or supported by, a church or other religious organization. Looks like my plumbing example may have been extreme because it doesn't necessarily have a religious purpose under those terms, but to be fair neither does the fortune 500 christian insurance company, whose primary purpose is to sell insurance, I was referring to earlier whose large legal department said we were legally safe to hire only christian salesmen and board members.
