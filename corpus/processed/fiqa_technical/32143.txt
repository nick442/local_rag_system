>I would also imagine the Latinos you see are american Some are. Many almost definitely aren't. Whatever their immigration status, they've all been exposed to good burritos. Some people simply care more about food/flavor than other people. Interesting about Minneapolis! I had no idea. MN in general seems like a nice place on the outside, but I haven't spent any significant amount of time there. I was hoping the area would be cold enough to prevent mosquitoes, but it sounds like that's not the case.
