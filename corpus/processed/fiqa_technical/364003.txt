I disagree and thankfully so does basic economics. If a business that is not successful shutters, then the needs that that business was fulfilling will be provided by a new business. The market usually finds a way. And no one is suggesting that random, arbitrary minimum wage increases are wise, simply that it makes no sense to have a minimum wage that doesn't mandate a livable salary.
