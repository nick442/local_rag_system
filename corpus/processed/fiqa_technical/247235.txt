No, the whole thing doesn't fall apart. The shock you describe is just the reallocation of resources to increase productivity to meet the supply and demand of the market. > Drawing all of that together though if you take it out to its logical conclusion when we hit full automation and even fast food is run by machines.. what are people going to do for employment? There will never be full automation ever unless you're talking about Sci-Fi stuff. There is absolutely no worry of a society that is completely controlled by robots that do everything for humans that will do absolutely no work whatsoever.
