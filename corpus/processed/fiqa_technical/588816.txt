It is a seasonality test what you did but google it for more statistical methods. Data meaning bias implies, You searched the whole data set for a pattern and got it, then when you implement your results don't give you that in practice due to the fact the pattern isn't really a pattern.. it's a feature of the dataset. Hmm, this would be difficult to test right now, your best bet is to test it for a few months before implementing it, however that is timely and a bit wasteful. You could just implement it and hope its right..
