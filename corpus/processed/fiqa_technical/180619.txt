#####&#009; ######&#009; ####&#009; [**Stagflation**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stagflation): [](#sfw) --- > >__Stagflation__, a [portmanteau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portmanteau) of *[stagnation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_stagnation)* and *[inflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation)*, is a term used in [economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics) to describe a situation where the [inflation rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_rate) is high, the economic growth rate slows down, and unemployment remains steadily high. It raises a dilemma for [economic policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_policy) since actions designed to lower inflation may exacerbate unemployment, and vice versa. >The term is generally attributed to a British politician who became chancellor of the exchequer in 1970, [Iain Macleod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iain_Macleod), who coined the phrase in his speech to [Parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom) in 1965. >Keynes didn't use the term, but some of his work refers to the conditions most would recognise as stagflation. In the version of [Keynesian macroeconomic theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynesian_economics) which was dominant between the end of WWII and the late-1970s, inflation and recession were regarded as mutually exclusive, the relationship between the two being described by the [Phillips curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phillips_curve). Stagflation is very costly and difficult to eradicate once it starts, in human terms as well as in budget deficits. >In the political arena, one measure of stagflation, termed the [Misery Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misery_index_(economics\)) (derived by the simple addition of the inflation rate to the unemployment rate), was used to swing presidential elections in the United States in 1976 and 1980. > >==== >[**Image**](https://i.imgur.com/NrpgJvM.png) [^(i)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Gdpercapita.PNG) --- ^Interesting: [^Periods ^of ^stagflation ^in ^Pakistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periods_of_stagflation_in_Pakistan) ^| [^History ^of ^the ^United ^States ^\(1964–80)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_States_\(1964%E2%80%9380\)) ^| [^1973–75 ^recession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973%E2%80%9375_recession) ^| [^Milton ^Friedman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Friedman) ^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+cjkxhkj) ^or[](#or) [^delete](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&message=%2Bdelete+cjkxhkj)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)
