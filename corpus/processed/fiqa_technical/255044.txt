"All who think that the magical ""Title II"" is going to 'fix' this *are being played*. All one has to do is consider the *old* (pre-1983) AT&T that was an absolute, vertically integrated monopoly, *and a 'common-carrier'* **at the same time**. ""Net Neutrality"" will *never* be 'solved' by regulatory agencies; there need to be *laws* to make it happen, on the order of an updated [Sherman Antitrust Act](https://www.britannica.com/event/Sherman-Antitrust-Act) improved with iron-clad definitions not subject to judicial 'penumbras'. BONUS: You *don't* want the internet to be under Title II anyway; that's what brought us monstrosities like the ""fairness"" doctrine, and will impose *the same type of censorship as affects Radio and TV now* on the Internet."
