>Because business is GREAT, right? The consumer and retail sectors ARENT suffering in the toilet? The whole economy is flourishing! Hate to break it to you but it's the republican policies of deregulation and tax cuts we can't afford that got us this shit sandwich. >Considering most wage earners live paycheck to paycheck and have very little in the way of savings it doesn't suprise me they don't appreciate companies who MUST do this to survive or risk running out of capital and going bankrupt. Really? Seems to me like a person living paycheck to paycheck would actually have a very good idea of what it's like to live on the edge of bankruptcy
