Oh c'mon, this is such bullshit. The reason it exists like this is because until piracy became a reality all of a movie's profits came from home-video. That model is broken now. It isn't some grand sinister conspiracy, it's slow adaptation to a new reality. Marketing, distribution, promotion.. it all has serious costs.
