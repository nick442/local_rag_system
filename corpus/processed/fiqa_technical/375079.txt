I'd rather have a pay raise because my bosses are actually pretty decent. They stay out of my way and let me do my job. Deadlines are usually so far down the road that I don't have to worry about it. They don't blame me for stuff that is demonstrably not my fault. The number of meetings that I get hauled into in a year, I can usually count on one hand. They tell me what they want done and leave deciding how it gets done up to me (I'm a web developer).
