What a silly question? They took all the Tax payer money and bought all the bad loans that the banks had on their books. They put all the bad loans as assets on the Feds books. But because it was bad and was not really worth anything, they created a further $1 Trillion, and loaned it out to all the Banks to show as tier I capital, and paid an interest of 2.5%, while the Fed rate was effectively 0%, on the understanding that this money could never leave the Fed, and was only for display purposes, hence they could over leverage that $1 Trillion many times over. The Banks then seem capitally adequate and required no further activity in the lending market as they generated 2.5% of fucking hot air, and the rest of the funny money could be played with in the ever buoyant Fed Stimulus supported equity markets. So no real money ever entered the real economy, no real organic growth occurred, so the Fed started to fudge the figures to show a employment and growth, but because there was no liquidity, there was no inflation. In short, all that grew since 2008 is the Size of the bubble between the Fed and the banks, and our paychecks went to the bankers bonuses for a job well done.
