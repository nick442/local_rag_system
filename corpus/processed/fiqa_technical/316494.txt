You could say the same thing but replace money with pacman and it would be true for the guys who are really good at pacman. Making money can be no different than any other hobby. The only difference is that you can engage in direct exchange after the fact instead of barter exchange. But make no mistake enjoying it does not make warren any more insane than the pacman guys (or more seriously most academics).
