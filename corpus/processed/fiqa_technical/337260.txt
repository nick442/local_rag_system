Well I think I can do it in less time. If I graduate with 3 passed, I can probably be done by 28 and I'm 21 now. A heart surgeon would still be in residency at this time. I'm already so stressed and pressured by these exams, I'm actually going to get my blood pressure checked at Walmart today. I'm not sure I can do it. I want to run for mayor one day or something. To do that I need to start doing things- big things. I can't get into the prestigious schools so I feel this is the next best thing, even if I don't find it interesting and find the work boring. ..
