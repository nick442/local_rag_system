This doesn't have anything to do with safety. It's about understanding what goes into something. You reference using every part of the buffalo, but they know what they're getting and what they're using. If BPI wants to label it and sell directly to consumers, they can feel free. Additionally, it's entirely likely they *didn't* use the parts that were used to create pink slime, as it can only be extracted mechanically.
