"The simple answer is..get everything you can. If you're closing the account then you want to have as complete a record as possible for yourself just for the sake of playing it safe. There's no such thing as having ""too much information"" when it comes to your financial records. You can never tell when something will come up that requires information from years past that you thought you'd never need, and if you don't have it, then what? This is a matter of being prudent, and while it make take some effort to obtain the records, it's better to be safe than sorry. Good luck!"
