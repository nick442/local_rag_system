Having stock options means that you have worked for and rightfully earned a part of the company's capital appreciation. Takeover of the company would indicate someone is interested in the company (something should be valuable). It would be unwise to not strike before the period lapses since the strike price is always lower than market price and takeovers generally increases stock values .. it is capital gains all the way my friend. Good luck. *observations not in professional capacity. pls consult a professional for investment related advice.
