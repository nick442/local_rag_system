"Probably people like me who thought they'd turned it all off. For the iphone: Settings -- Privacy -- Location Services -- System Services There you'll see a bunch of system services you probably don't need but (if my phone is any indication) are used pretty regularly to get location data on you. Some may be okay with you, but worth checking out. A few things I looked up: **Cell Network Search** - it's monitoring for Apple's benefit, having this on doesn't do anything for you; turning it off won't affect using your phone **Compass Calibration** - your maps will work fine without this, and you can still calibrate the compass while using it; having it on just lets them .. check location to calibrate a compass you're not using? **Motion Calibration & Distance** - for fitness stuff like tracking steps **Setting Time Zone** - if you don't travel between time zones often, you probably don't need Apple checking your location every day to constantly ""set time zone"""
