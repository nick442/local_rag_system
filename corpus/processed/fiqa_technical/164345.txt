I have lived in five of the 7 continents. Yes, I have been outside my house. Part of that time was in third world countries where you get to see what it looks like when you don't have basic government services. > And I don't know where the hell you live but I have to pay for my own internet, had to pay to get the lines put in too. Did you pay for the interstate which allowed for those cables to be brought to your state? The transportation and security that imported those cables if they weren't made in the USA? Did you pay for the installation of the utilities that made it possible for you to even have power in your house? The answer to all these is yes, through your taxes.
