I drove myself into serious debt until a friend persuaded me to start budgeting and told me about Out Of The Dark Budgeting. This free budgeting site made a huge difference for me because it made money management so simple for me and it provides many good suggestions and advice. I particularly like the cash put aside feature and credit card debt terminator both of which helped me move from bad spending habits to responsible money management so now I waste less and have more for what I really need and love, and most importantly, I am on my way to being debt free, a very powerful feeling already. Good luck.
