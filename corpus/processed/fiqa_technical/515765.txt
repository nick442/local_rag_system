>So if some 3rd world country with 0 infrastructure offers a better tax environment, we should just join them in the race to the bottom? US companies don't want to domicile in a 3rd world country. That's not who we compete with for corporate domiciling. We compete with other anglophone countries and some northern European countries with far lower tax rates. >but whatever is happening in the tax code that makes these inversions possible needs to be fixed. That would be the high tax rate. Unless you want to make it illegal for an American company to buy another company or to sell itself. I expect we will hear that soon from some of the totalitarian leftists. the NYTimes has the cyclical average effective corp tax rate for S&P500 companies at 29%. That's pulled from CapIQ which pulls directly from SEC documents. http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/05/25/sunday-review/corporate-taxes.html Citizens for Tax Justice is a hopelessly distorted propaganda outfit. The summary (let alone the org's name) should have alerted you that any findings are distorted bullshit. These dumb fucks don't think stock compensation is an expense. They do not understand the economic reasoning behind accelerated depreciation. They are financially and economically retarded. On top of that they desire the full 35% corporate tax rate on all global income of US corporations without any deferments, by far the most punitive corporate tax treatment in the entire world.
