I had my car seized last year and I was charged thousands and had a ton of hardships and almost lost my car and was without it for 2 months due to this. Also they didn't tell me what I was being charged. When I fell behind my car insurance, Wells Fargo automatically started charging me without notifying me. Also what pissed me off was they never told me about the charges when I went into the bank to pay my car note every month. I paid my car note in person every month and I ASKED them every month what my payment was and they never once told me about any additional charges. That's what pissed me off. The fact that I walked into the bank every month, made my payment, and NO ONE informed me of any additional charges. Every month I walked in, verified my payment, and paid in full. I was livid when I received a phone call months later that I owed thousands and when I asked if I could set up a payment plan because I couldn't pay all at once, I was threatened and insulted. Then a week or so later my car is missing from in front of my house and I began the long tedious process of getting it back. It totally fucked up my finances and mental health. I hate Wells Fargo. So fucking shady. This stuff really affects real people.
