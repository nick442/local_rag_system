A tip I tend to put in here that doesn't directly relate to student loan payments, but does matter: Don't focus so much on student loan payments that you find yourself needing to tap short-term credit sources to make ends meet. Making a $100 payment on a 6% interest student loan and then needing to charge a $100 car repair on your 19% interest credit card is not a sound financial move.
