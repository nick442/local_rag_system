There's the [Home Planner for IKEA](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.planner5d.swedishhomedesign) app that has been around for a couple of years or so now. I had it but had to delete it from my phone since it was taking up space and hogged too much RAM on my old phone. It's pretty fun, though!
