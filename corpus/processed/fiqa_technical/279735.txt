John - sure, your points are well taken. $500K in cash is preferable to $500K invested in a way I wouldn't choose at the moment. A friendly warning - inheritances often come in the form of an IRA account. This comes with its own issues, and an IRA shouldn't be confused with the assets it contains. Selling the assets inside is fine, you can reinvest in what you wish, but selling and pulling the money out can result in an horrific tax bill. I was recently interviewed on the radio (and available as a Podcast) discussing Inherited IRA Tax Tips, and it's worth educating yourself as the topic is quite convoluted. (And thanks, John, for a question that permitted me to sneak this in. I owe you a beverage)
