"*And now, a century and a half after the Crimean War, the conflict that arose there this year serves as a reminder of the durability of American and European derision for Russia, seen as ""a gas station masquerading as a country,"" in the words of Senator John McCain. ""Russia is an anti-Western power with a different, darker vision of global politics,"" Anne Applebaum, an author and journalist who is married to Poland's foreign minister, Radoslaw Sikorski, wrote in Slate. (The headline: ""Russia Will Never Be Like Us."") The seemingly everlasting British tradition of Russophobia is nowadays embodied by an editor at the Economist, Edward Lucas, a former Moscow bureau chief for that magazine who, in a Daily Mail column back in May, labored to draw scary parallels between Hitler and Putin in their respective ""expansionist"" ambitions. While Putin's actions no doubt fall far short of Hitler's atrocities, ""the Austrian corporal and the German-speaking ex-spy do share troubling similarities,"" Lucas said. ""History may not repeat itself. But, as Mark Twain once said, it often rhymes."" And in an imagined letter sent by Machiavelli to Putin, crafted by Josef Joffe, publisher-editor of the German weekly Die Zeit, Russia's leader is scolded, ""You have just reaffirmed a historic Russian habit: You would rather be the great spoiler and outsider."" Surely Europe, though, as Joffe must be keenly aware, has seen a great many spoilers in its periodic lettings of blood and gore. The history of Europe, it sometimes seems, is a prolonged case of pots calling kettles black.* [The Eternal Collapse of Russia](http://nationalinterest.org/feature/the-eternal-collapse-russia-11126?page=show) By Paul Starobin..
