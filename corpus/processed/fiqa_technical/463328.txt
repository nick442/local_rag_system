"Translation : Funds managers that use traditionnal methods to select stocks will have less success than those who use artificial intelligence and computer programs to select stocks. Meaning : The use of computer programs and artificial intelligence is THE way to go for hedge fund managers in the future because they give better results. ""No man is better than a machine, but no machine is better than a man with a machine."" Alternative article : Hedge-fund firms, Wall Street Journal. A little humour : ""Whatever is well conceived is clearly said, And the words to say it flow with ease."" wrote Nicolas Boileau in 1674."
