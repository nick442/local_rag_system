Okay, [it's not perfectly steady, but the upward trend is clear](http://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&s=8_NA_8DO_NUS_4&f=A). I suspect the sharp drop at the start of 2006 was due to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, and the drop in 2010 was the recession really kicking in for the broader economy. >This seems contrary to price trends of gasoline. I'm trying to understand it without automatically jumping to speculators on the commodities market. There's more to the price of gasoline than the amount of refinery capacity available. [Gasoline prices](http://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&s=EER_EPMRU_PF4_Y35NY_DPG&f=D) mostly track [crude oil prices](http://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&s=RBRTE&f=D). Crude oil is up because growth in demand is faster than growth in supply. No speculators needed.
