Freedom of religion is fine, except islam isn't a religion, it's a terrorist organization. It's just been mis-classified but a lot of people are waking up right now and realizing it. This isn't about me being a racist, this is about me not wanting any more innocent people to get their heads cut off, blown the fuck up, or hit with hammers, in the name of fucking Allah.
