Very interesting deal in that they will not be doing a joint venture that has been a requirement of every other automaker that has opened a factory in that country. But instead wholly own it..that should address concerns about their proprietary processes and technology being siphoned off to domestic companies.. >The WSJ reports that Tesla will own the factory, rather than partner with a local manufacturer, as it typically the case. Chinese officials have recently begun to consider relaxing some of the more stringent rules concerning local partners, as a way to encourage electric vehicle manufacturers. The arrangement would be the “first of its kind for a foreign auto maker,” but will likely not allow Tesla to avoid a 25 percent import tariff.
