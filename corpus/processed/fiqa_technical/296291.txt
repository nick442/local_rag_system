Yeah the three companies they put weren't the best examples of market irrationality and there are better ones, but I think they were the biggest targets of a short news piece. TSLA is arguably one of the prime examples. I also listed CMG in my original statement but there are plenty more too that are continually pumped up for no good reason at all. Amazon is actually beginning to make some big leaps and bounds. I used to be a doubter (still don't invest in them or anything) but I do think Amazon has a bright future, barring the possibility of a gov't split up, but with how well the gov't has received Amazon so far, I don't see that as an issue for the near term, even though Amazon is getting to become quite a monopoly is many industries.
