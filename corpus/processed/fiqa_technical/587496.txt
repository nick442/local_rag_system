Regardless of who is actually filling the positions, these jobs aren't meant for adults with families. They're part time, no-responsibility positions that pay beer money for teenagers and college students. Employing those types is part of the business model. Nobody has a right to inject themselves into that model and then suddenly demand a full time position and the associated benefits simply because their personal life circumstances require it. The problem is that there aren't enough full time positions out there to support families on, not that fast food joints don't offer those full time positions.
