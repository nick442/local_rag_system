I think what he means are comments on different time stamps of a song. I mainly use the phone app but if I listen to music at work on the website you can see little comments pop up on the song timeline thing. I'm sure it's useful for finding parts of a song you like, especially for those hour long+ remix type songs that are basically a bunch of songs together.
