"In Portugal, I have a three bedroom apartment in a pretty good area. However, I can tell you about my aunt that raised two boys as a maid in a two bedroom apartment. They are not rich, but never starved, lacked clothing or anything vital. Let me elaborate. In Lisbon, you pay around $30 for public transportation that includes the entire subway system, all buses in the great Lisbon area and trains. That one $30 card that we call ""passe"" lets you go around the city and you never have to wait more than 15 minutes for a bus; subway comes around every 5 minutes. Schools are 100% free and public schools are far better, have more prestige and give access to the best jobs - private schools can't compete. I used to pay $3 a day for meals when I was a kid when I didn't want to walk home, even though I had cooked meals waiting. There were 4 schools within 10-25 (farthest) minutes of walking distance and crime was so low that we all walked to school at age 11. It was in Coimbra (has one of the oldest, most historic and prestigious universities in Europe). That all leads me to gas, you really only have to spend money on gas if you want to. My sister begged my father to buy her a car for months, when he finally did she sold it after a year (don't recall exactly). We lived really close to a subway exit, even when I went partying I just called a cab and would pay no more than $15 total. One last note, I have never met anyone who went through financial struggles because of medical bills in Portugal. My best friend's mother lost her life to cancer, their life didn't change one bit financially. When I say that to friends here, they are shocked and this reaction is what makes me sad. I am not a socialist or capitalist, both can have flaws if taken to extremes. However, I believe that those that genuinely try and work should have the chance to live a decent life."
