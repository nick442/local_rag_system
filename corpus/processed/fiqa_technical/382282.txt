Sorry they're not respecting you just because of your age. The same thing happened to me when I managed a frozen yogurt shop at 18. It's a tough situation to be in. The only appropriate option is to stay as professional as possible. But your info has been really helpful thank you much! You seem like a great leader for your team.
