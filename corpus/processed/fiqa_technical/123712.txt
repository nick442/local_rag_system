"Keep in mind, if the name is trademarked, you might have it taken away from you. If it's generic, there's a good chance the potential buyer would just move on and set up another domain name. Consider web names such as Stockpickr. The proper spelling is there, and remains unused, ""This domain may be for sale"" at the top of the page. I'm guessing they asked for too much money and the potential buyer just decided to move on. We are at the point where the new domain extensions (.space .name .guru and hundreds more) have watered down the potential value of many sets of words. I'm sure there are still good names, and yours might be as good as you think, but you might find resistance getting a deal that lasts beyond the sale date."
