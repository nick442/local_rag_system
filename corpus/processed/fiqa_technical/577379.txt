Most places have property taxes so I'd be shocked if the UK didn't. If people didn't have to pay income/VAT/sales taxes then they would be able to afford the higher property taxes. It is probably true enough though that the government is likely to not raise as much revenue (though that isn't guaranteed: more efficient taxation collection combined with more objective/simple rules for business is likely to increase real economic growth). As a person who thinks government has expanded well beyond what is good for society however, I see the shrinking of government as a good thing.
