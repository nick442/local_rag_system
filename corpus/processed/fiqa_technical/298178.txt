Has the monitoring stopped now that you are at a new bank? Presumably it has. If it has stopped, then let it go. Its your mom and while the relationship might be somewhat dysfunctional, it is the only mother relationship you have. Do you really want her criminally prosecuted? She may have done you a favor by pointing out the security loop holes present in your old bank. Thanks mom!
