Yeah, even then. Maybe a bit more, depending on travel. I'd have a fully-paid for house. If taxes are absurd on the property I might need to bump up the number. Vehicles, fully paid for. Machine tools, heavy-duty sewing gear, firearms & hunting/camping gear, most of the tooling needed to produce anything I need, a well-equipped kitchen, and land with some livestock, woodlot, farm, and orchard. Power from wind/solar with a backup genset & link to the grid as a last resort, wells for water. As I said: Initial cost would be high, but after that my cost of living would be damned low. Hell, I'd probably spend more on books than food.
