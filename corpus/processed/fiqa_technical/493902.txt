The thing about this, is that it isn’t one or two big decisions. It’s the thousands of smaller decisions. It’s the choice not to fund cost saving projects because spending cash looks bad this second. It’s not filling critical individual contributor roles and having too many levels of management. I can give you plenty of examples that show death by 1000 cuts but I think the best example is this: Internal projects (in general) need to be completed within the same calendar year. Any money that you do not spend in 2017 will not be there for you in 2018. So there is a mad rush in the beginning of the year to spend money and by September all the cash has been used up. Productivity takes a big hit and a significant amount of effort is spent jockeying for next years funding. GE is a financial company that makes things. It’s run by accountants not by logic.
