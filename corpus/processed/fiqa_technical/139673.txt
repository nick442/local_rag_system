> You need a new TV since your old one broke, and you already know Walmart's grocery prices are the best, so you figure their TV prices are the best, and you buy a TV at Walmart. .. > ..but when you rely on Amazon Solution, diversify where you buy your consumer goods. Don't shop by bare minimum price, shop by which retailers you want to support. If you can't afford something except at walmart, you probably can't afford it in general. Nobody is pricing necessities out of affordability. Nobody *needs* a television > They already own your attention and buying interests, and it's no big deal to you, the consumer, because you'd rather a one-stop-shop for your goods than have choices. don't assume people are as passive in their purchasing decisions as you appear to be. No retailer or for-profit business should be blindly patronized. I regularly pay more for things, to get them sourced, manufactured, or sold in a way that lines up with my beliefs. Sometimes I just won't buy something I'm in the market for. That's putting your money where your mouth is, and money is the only language these large retailers speak.
