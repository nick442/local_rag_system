I recall hearing of at least one, but it's really only a matter of time. Personally, I never thought I'd get in an accident, but I learned how naive that thought was on Monday when I totaled my car after a guy turned left in front of me. That particular situation is something that bothers me about Uber/Lyft's model, their drivers are screwed if they ever get in a wreck and their insurance company finds out what they were doing. And if they don't tell them, then it's insurance fraud.
