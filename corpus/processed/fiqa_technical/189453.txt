yeah i got that pretty much down. I also want to be able to advantage of our transportation capacity that we already own and perhaps make an extra buck here and there on border spreads. Just need to wrap my head around how to go about doing that. Is there a tool out there that'll help me scrub spreads and do a quick analysis on?
