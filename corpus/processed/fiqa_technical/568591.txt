And again, not true. Ive been to literally hundreds of warehouses. The only ones with climate control are food storage warehouses that need to be below freezing, or amazon. No other company in my experience has the kind of systems in place to keep employees as comfortable as possible given the job. As for medical care, the warehouses i know the most about require an active EMT or paramedic license for medical responders in the warehouse. I remember the articles years ago about working conditions at Amazon, but ive not seen anything to prove those accusations, and ive seen plenty to convince me they either are no longer valid, or they never were in the first place
