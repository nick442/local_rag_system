"The definition of insurance is the transfer of risk. Thus, you're paying for transferring of a risk (of an item/property) to the insurer (carrier), so that they bear the financial burden of a loss/accident and not you. You could always self-insure, but a lot of times, insurance is cheaper, since due to the ""Law of Large Numbers"" the insurer can just charge a premium that is small percentage in comparison to the cost of self-insuring."
