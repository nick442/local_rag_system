I get a subscription to WSJ through work and I use it everyday. What is the price of the subscription though? I find it useful and Barrons has a lot regarding business and the stock market. A lot of professionals have subscriptions to the WSJ. I prefer the WSJ over other services and I really like the market data they provide.
