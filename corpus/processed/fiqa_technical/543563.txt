As someone who knows about farms, I am surprised you don't realize most mega farms use antibiotics not because of normal animal health issues but due to feeding animals a diet that keeps them sick birth to slaughter (cows are not meant to eat corn for example). Or because of unhealthy, densely packed environments (chickens who can't even move while living in their own filth).
