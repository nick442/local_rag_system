I went to one of those seminars, some huge HUGE bullshit scheme. I like what RDPD does with inspiring you, but they were riding on his name to make you increase your credit limit, put things on the card, take a trip to some other country to learn more about real estate, all the while giving them thousands of dollars. Total bullshit. I now have more rental properties, doing it my way, and I made money with each purchase. Was the one you went to from the Tigris company or something like that?
