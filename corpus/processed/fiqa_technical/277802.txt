It's ok if you haven't fleshed out the ideas yet. It's partially why I'm asking questions. Something you said seemed incorrect and it's better to verify than assume. I'll check out Friedman's video when I have time, though I've read up on him a bit and find some of his theories hold up and some don't. Can't be specific ATM though.
