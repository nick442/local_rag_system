"Based on my experience ~~making hiring decisions~~ [working with a fortune 500 company legal team to make hiring decisions] I don't believe anything illegal *necessarily* happened. You're allowed to discriminate against that list all the time like when hiring a model, an actor, or a pastor that have to be a specific age/gender/ethnicity/religion, etc or other jobs that require it. And yes, any public facing position at an explicitly christian organization does require it. If I call a christian plumbing company I would expect them to send a christian plumber. You can also discriminate against the degree to which someone is religious as well. Imagine if you couldn't use answers like ""Do you go to church regularly"" when interviewing a pastor. I worked previously for a christian organization that required many positions to be christians like salesmen and board members. All other internal positions like accountants, etc. they would not even ask ""are you christian"" for legal reasons because it wasn't required for the job. So it was either explicitly required in the job description or they couldn't ask or take it into account when hiring you."
