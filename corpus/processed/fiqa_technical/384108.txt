I didn't get mad about it. If I was mad, I would downvote you; but I don't even remember the last time I actually downvoted someone on here. I'm actually indifferent to it. If I wanted karma, I would just spend all my time commenting in the rising queue. That's how you rake in karma. I pointed out abuse of subreddit rules to undermine the contrarian's credibility. Doesn't care about the rules; doesn't care about the facts; just pushing a shill opinion: dismissed.
