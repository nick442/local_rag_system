The $10,000 is only for international travel, that you have to declare it I mean, you can still carry more. Interstate travel you should be able to carry as much as you'd like. The deal with banks is that any deposits over $10,000 have to be reported to the IRS. If he has a bill of sale or some other such device there should be no issues with the banks. Now if he doesn't claim the income on his taxes, he could have issues with the IRS though. A quick search would give you all that information and more..
