Not at all, I fully understand you. I am in this industry and understand how these products work. I dont do these type per say but our product has a high enough interest rate that my clients all are going to do this themselves. Hell, I am going to do it with mine and my wifes policies too. Its a very nice form of passive retirement income on top of 401k, ira's etc.
