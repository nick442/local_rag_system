"the image of the warship was supposed to show something big that can change direction ""on a dime"" like companies can with Twitter on the desktop will Twitter find its way onto business devices like laptops, desktops, ipads, and cell phones? absolutely, I make the argument (briefly) that business devices may be Twitter's biggest untapped market yet. for true, dynamic, news discovery - the only answer is Twitter. why not use it for ""Business News"" as well. if any part of the vision, strategy, mission, plan, tactic, etc. changes - everyone who needs to know will know immediately with no excuses like ""i didn't read the email"". let's take conversations ""back"" from emails into a land where a searchable history exists for anyone to reference or fact check."
