From my POV, if the title doesn't match the skills listed as requirements and the pay is below what it should be I just won't apply. Younger me would, then would snub the HR team after they get huffy when my first question is will you pay X with YZ benefits potentially? If not let's just stop talking to each other now. Older me is too busy and too grumpy to waste my time with incompetent HR, tell me what you want and I'll apply if it fits. If I have to guess it's probably a safe assumption that you don't know or are hoping for a skilled worker for peanuts and I've got no reason to bother with you. /rant I get the 'reason' HR does this, now you'll have to accept less qualified candidates are going to apply because it's not worth your bullshit.
