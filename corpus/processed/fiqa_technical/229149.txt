I forgot to respond to this comment. WorldQuant is nothing like MIT, Harvard, or the CFA institute. You only need to take a look at their courses to see that. Where Compare their syllabus with the top 20 MFE programs: https://www.quantnet.com/mfe-programs-rankings/ Where are their math courses? (Look for page 38) https://wqu.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/WorldQuant-University-Catalog-Volume-2-1_10_17.pdf?v=76cb0a18730b%E2%80%9D Compare with: [University of Chicago's Financial Mathematics](https://finmath.uchicago.edu/page/five-quarter-track) [NYU's Mathematics in Finance](https://math.nyu.edu/financial_mathematics/academics/courses/) [Columbia Universities Financial Engineering](http://ieor.columbia.edu/concentration/259) It's nowhere as rigorous as these programs. Key components of education in risk, derivatives modeling, stochastic calculus and more mathematics is completely missing. Not to mention there isn't even C++ as a requirement which is a must know for financial engineers.
