how far do you live from the store? unless amazon has 1 hr delivery, anything I want is easier to get locally than on amazon. Not only that, I can choose to support walmart or the local mom and pop shops. My day isn't interrupted because I'll make the most of it, like go fill up gas, buy needed groceries, get lunch, meet a friend, or sometimes just people watch while I shop.
