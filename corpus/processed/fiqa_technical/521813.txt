Holy shit that can't be USA unless you're talking about commercial lending, even then sky high rates. For the 97% LTV we sell at 3.58 last Saturday. We're a large bank too, so none of that credit unions selling themselves short nonsense. Mind you that's a special program through Fanny, but our normal rates are something like 4.4-4.55 depending on the day for 80/20 How can you be conservative but loan to credit score of over 500? We don't even look at under 640 and we're considered somewhat conservative.
