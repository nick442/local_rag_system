I think you hit it on the head. Childhood perception does not mesh with adult reality. A few years after I'd gotten back into Lego as an adult I was visiting my parents and dug out my childhood collection. I was shocked how small it was. I built *worlds* with that collection, but I doubt it was even 2000 pieces. As an adult I bought more Lego in one purchase than I'd had my entire childhood.
