i think you're right regarding Amazon, but overall the grocery sector is experiencing a price battle especially with chains like Aldi and Winco expanding. Now with Amazon throwing their hat in the ring, I think their muscle and reach puts more downward pressure on prices sector wide even if this is just temporary penetration pricing. will be interesting to see how this plays out.
