Not being able to keep up with demand--for at least a foreseeable 5 years, as you just said--is a pretty huge failure in itself, and I don't see them being able to last. They underestimated the market and I expect some of the big established automakers like Toyota, Ford, and Nissan to swoop down and meet the demand with their own offerings as well as with new models. Tesla, as you just noted, still has yet to be PROFITABLE, whereas Amazon has been around for some 20 years now, and HAS actually turned a profit, and they've had the huge ups and downs of just about any 20-year-old business, so your comparison of Amazon's last-quarter losses to Tesla's last-quarter losses is pretty absurd.
