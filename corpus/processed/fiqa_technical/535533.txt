DirecTV.. Time Warner.. Netflix.. 2 iPhones (= 2*Data plan).. $280 a month on pure luxuries. >10% of your net income. Of course, you may be needing at least some of this, no-one wants to come home and stare at bare walls. But if you have Netflix - maybe you don't need DirecTV? Or the other way around? And maybe DSL internet will be cheaper than cable? Maybe prepaid $1/day AT&T GoPhone or similar plan would be better than paying $151 for two iPhones?
