">I have never heard that phrase before. Thanks for posting that. You're welcome. It was (once upon a time) a commonly understood ""meme"". Sadly in recent decades we have ""lost"" (ignored? set aside?) a lot of collected human wisdom that was passed down via such stories & parables (and regardless of whether the ""original"" was a REAL historical incident, the lesson via analogy can still be applicable and thus ""true""). >It fits perfectly in this situation Alas, yes it does. Even worse, politicians are in many senses ""selling"" not only their constituents collective ""birthrights"" but are (in some cases) making them (and their children, even the unborn) into proverbial indentured slaves."
