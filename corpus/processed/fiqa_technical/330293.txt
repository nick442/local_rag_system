No joke, I once saw a guy on 29th st in Manhattan between 5th and Madison (right in front of that really old little church) next to his big Poland Spring truck, filling up the blue water cooler bottles with a fucking hose. I thought about snapping a pic and going viral, but I figured it was unlikely that this guy would intentionally be risking his job to save Nestle a few cents, and he probably got told to do it.
