"Except for one thing, right now there is a large amount of speculation, lots of numbers are inflated. And then we have the high frequency traders, this tax would make it harder to make money on nothing, which is what they are doing currently. Personally I would be fine with it if the tax became ""exempt"" after say holding the stock for 3-6-12 months. This tax also isn't about making money, its about making the market more secure. One of the downsides is that if all the major markets don't commit to it, it likely will hurt anyone that does."
