Being lucky is definitely a part of it, but being smart on how to navigate each choice is NOT based on luck. Think of a blackjack game. A game based on luck, but you can make logical moves that can help you win. Do you double-down on an 11 with 3 face cards on the table?, probably not. Do you split the tens with lots of low cards on the table?, yes. So to think it's only luck that determines one success is naive.
