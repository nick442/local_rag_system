Here's a brief history of the car industry: in the late 1800s and early 1900s, there was a real competition between electric cars and internal-combustion cars. No clear winner. Electric cars were super reliable, quite, no maintenance and simple to make. But can be driven for a shorter distance only. Gas cars where the exact opposite: long range, but totally unreliable, complicated, noisy, dirty, complicated to make. With service stations to exchange batteries, already in the late 1800s, the electric car would be a huge winner. But the government was smart! And I mean it! Electric cars needs very few jobs and manufacturing: few parts to manufacture, no maintenance crew, and since they can last forever, very few of them are needed to be produced every year. So, on purpose, the government promoted the gas car, creating millions of jobs, 1000s of manufacturing companies, economy of the need to replace the car every 5-10 years, etc. That's it. Last comment: an electric car should be dirt cheap to make! It needs one cheap electric engine, batteries and a pedal connected to a switch. How come Tesla cars are so expensive? Think about it for a moment.
