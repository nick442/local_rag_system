I don't think it's a coincidence that many of the people who voted for, and continue to support Trump also believe in the prophesies of Nostradamus. Anything Trump says is so vaguely worded it could mean almost anything. For instance, his whole $12 a month thing could be construed, with enough tweaking, to mean Medicare, as that's about what someone working part time in a minimum wage job would be paying for medicare. So, you see? It makes perfect sense.
