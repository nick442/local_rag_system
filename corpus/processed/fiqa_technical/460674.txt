My cousins bought a gas station, their lives have been shitty ever since. However they dont have a convenience store which is where all the money is at apparently. The father bought it for 600k, land and all. Supposively he thought it was worth over a mil due to the land valuation. The business operations standpoint is that they make minimum wage.
