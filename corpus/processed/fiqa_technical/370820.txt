">Independant here means 'not the BLS'. If you think that MIT is just another supporter of the status quo, you could be right, but it seems a bit of a stretch, especially since they are sampling in a completely different way and so very broadly. The problem isn't in the ""sampling"", it's in the methodology of the final computation. And on that, they are hardly ""independent"" -- do the computation based on essentially the same set of basic (flawed) assumptions -- and you still arrive at pretty much the same (flawed) conclusions."
