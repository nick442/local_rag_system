"Things are in fact more complicated. It really depends what you mean by ""ticker"" and who gave you this ticker. There is several codes to identify a security: The Bloomberg code contains a code to identify the exchange as in ALU:FP the FP part refers to Euronext Paris. The RIC code works the same way but with a different convention. Exchanges are identified by the MIC code.(they are in fact divided in market segments with each market segment having a main market segment) ISIN and SEDOL codes do not provide informations about the exchange so they are usually given with a MIC. There is no guarantee that Reuters and Bloomberg won't use the same company code to refer to different company. But they usually use the exchange ticker. This ticker is requested by each company and can be anything. They are accepted most of the time. But sometimes to avoid confusion some requests are rejected. (For instance FBI ticker was refused) For more info read: The evolution of ticker symbols Financial providers like Bloomberg provides services to be informed when a security is added/removed from a market."
