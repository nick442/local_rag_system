You can open an HSA account with any financial institution that you like, and roll over the money from your current account into the new one. Since you are no longer in a High Deductible Health Plan, you can't contribute any new money into an HSA, but you can still spend the money in your HSA on eligible medical expenses, until it is gone. There are lots of things that you can spend HSA money on, so there is no need to cash out and take on taxes and penalties. Yes, there are HSA accounts that don't charge ongoing maintenance fees. Check with a local credit union; they usually have no-fee HSA accounts.
