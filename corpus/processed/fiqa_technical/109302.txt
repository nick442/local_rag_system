Oh hey, let's take an insane valuation from the peak of the tech bubble and act like it should be a useful metric. Exxon has a market cap around 430 billion, Apple is just under 600 billion. Microsoft was never making enough nor looked like it could sustain enough growth to support a 600b market cap. Don't be stupid. The stock was grossly overvalued as everything was then.
