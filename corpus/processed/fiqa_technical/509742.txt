Make sure your English is as fluent as you can, and learn more about western cultures so you can talk about peoples home countries with them. You don't need to be an expert but just enough to get a conversation started and get people talking. A random discussion about an old American TV show called Stargate SG1 on a overnight train in Thailand resulted in the waitress selling me a lot more coffee than she would have done otherwise.
