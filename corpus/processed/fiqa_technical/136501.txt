It works across the entire city of London. This isn't a pipe dream with no real-life examples. In reality, people watch out, drive slower, and keep their eyes open so they don't cross all the time. No one wants to die in the streets after all. > You lack common sense and to be honest, I have never have read anything so ridiculous. This is the 'common sense' that I have lived with all my life in a city shared by millions of people in a first world country. > You are saying that despite the fact that it is not only safer for pedestrians to use a consistent and well known area to walk, If people don't use cross walks, you should change the rules so drivers don't expect people to use cross walks and thus start paying attention to the *reality* that people are crossing all the time. > I can think of many reasons of why you lack any sort of logic, but I just don't have the time to pick apart why this is the worst comment I have ever read on reddit. Nope you can't. I do dare you to though, because it'd be an interesting discussion.
