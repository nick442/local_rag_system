>(thus credit does cost a bit more) A ton more. An incredible amount more. You are basically going from secured creditors who can recover assets like rent, improvements, or the real estate to unsecured creditors who can recover nothing. The cost of financing would be prohibitive. Congrats, you've grinded the economy to a halt.
