A lot of poor money management, lack of adaptation to changing times..It's kind of ironic; the boomers were the protesters in the 60's, calling for freedom from the man, an open society, and shaking down the pillars of society, and yet now are the ones who are clinging to the very fabric of society they sought to tear apart. Stability was anathema to them when they were in their 20's, but now look at them..desperately attempting to get things back to 'the way they were'.
