In my experience, even with such POS machines, there is a display that asks you to confirm your total, as a very last step, even if they ask if you want a receipt as a first step. By this manner, it would be nearly impossible for the teller to change the total without you noticing, so long as you read the total given to you by the device. The scam in question is more likely to happen in a restaurant with the additional tip segment, allowing someone to give themselves more of a tip than you initially wrote onto the receipt. This is the only way I believe you would have a feasible chance of being cheated like this.
