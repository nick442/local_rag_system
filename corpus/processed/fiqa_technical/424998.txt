"First, my economics professor would kill me if I didn't point out that lowering the price doesn't change **demand,** only **quantity demanded.** There's a pretty big difference between the two. Anyway, the answer to your question is..it depends. You're hoping that people who don't buy your sandwich for the original price will start buying it at the lower price. You're also hoping that once you increase the price they'll continue to buy it. The relationship describing how much a change in price affects the quantity demanded is known as elasticity. Elastic demand means that small changes will have a big affect on buying decisions. Inelastic demand means that buyers are not very flexible and will continue to purchase even after a significant price increase. Theoretically, at least. The decision to raise or lower a price is a very complex process with a lot of variables, so I don't think anyone can give you a ""right answer"" to your question. Practically, you need to figure out where these extra customers are coming from. If they aren't buying your sandwiches now because there's a cheaper alternative, lowering the price might entice them to buy from you instead. However, this means that when you raise the price back, they'll likely leave again. If they don't know about your deli or haven't tried your sandwiches yet, a change in price isn't likely to do any good without a strong marketing campaign to back it up. The uniqueness of your product could also have an effect. If your product is subway quality at higher prices, no one is going to stick around. On the other hand, if you lace your sandwiches with crack, you might get some repeat customers. Long-term loyalty is key ;) Hopefully this rambling helps you. It's late and I need to sleep. Good luck!"
