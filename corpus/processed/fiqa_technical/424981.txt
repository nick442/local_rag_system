You realize he has been saying this for years? He knows the system is broken because he uses the broken parts of the system to his advantage every day to make more money. He has very clearly explained how he makes so much money and just as clearly explained multiple ways in which he could be stopped from doing so. He isn't spreading some lie about helping the system through tax breaks, he is explaining how we can get more money out of him and everyone like him and help stop the accumulation of ridiculous amounts of wealth that benefit nobody.
