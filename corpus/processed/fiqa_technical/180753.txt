Somewhere on your block, perhaps even in your neighborhood tonight, someone will become homeless. The reason of their homelessness might be a domestic fight, the loss of a job, or an argument with a parent. Nowadays, it very well could be caused by a foreclosure; but whatever the reason, that family will be all of a sudden on the street.
