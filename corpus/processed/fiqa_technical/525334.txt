"> I don't know all the background details of the methodology.. Fair enough. > I do trust the analysis that NZ is freer than the US.. Then I have a specific question. [The Heritage Foundation's score of business freedom](http://www.heritage.org/index/regulatory-efficiency) is ""a quantitative measure of the ability to start..a business.."" plus other things. In the US, health care is an issue when starting a business because the entrepreneurs must give up a subsided plan with their former jobs and then they need to research and buy a plan at their new company. This is all because health care is tied to work here in the US. New Zealand doesn't have these problems because, as /u/Ratl0r mentioned, they have universal health care. Would you agree that the US moving to a universal health care system would make it easier for its citizens to start a business?"
