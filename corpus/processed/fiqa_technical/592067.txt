"Getting someone else to save for you with their ISA allowance has some quite significant disadvantages: You'll be using up their ISA allowance, so they won't be able to make their own tax-free savings. Perhaps you know someone who doesn't want to use it anyway and is happy to do this, but most people probably don't. You are essentially handing them the money and relying on them to voluntarily give it back to you when the time comes. Even if you trust them to do this, if they have financial problems in the meantime then their creditors would be able to go after the money in the ISA, and would have an equal or better claim to it that you would. When the money is returned to you, you would become liable to tax on the interest anyway. From the perspective of your own tax situation, it's extra income to you that wasn't protected by any ISA allowance of yours. While in practice you might be able to get away with not declaring it to anyway and not be detected, it would still be illegal tax evasion and thus rather risky. So overall it's not really a very effective ""bypass"" for whatever restriction a bank wants to impose on your ISA holdings."
