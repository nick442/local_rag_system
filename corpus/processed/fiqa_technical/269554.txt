I would suggest a PEL. Created for this kind of scenario. If you are sure to by a house, then it could be the support you need and without risk. Even it's 1%, it's better than 0,75% with Livret A, and it can have some other plus. But you will have your money for sure the moment you'll need it. (Source in French) But, carefull on some points : If you don't want a house anymore, then, it's a waste of time. Same if you want to buy too fast (before 2/3 years). You have a child. It can be expensive. Be sure to have some cash to handle every situation. So you can avoid to withdraw and destroy PEL before buying just because you're low on cash.
