Protect competition, not protect competitors. In a lot of cases in the tech world no one knows who the competitors is a few quarters/years down the road. Also, enforce regulations against regulation-arbitrage companies like Uber/Lyft, AirBnB, or reg-arb tech like ICO, all of which relied on regulatory leeways allowing them to crush existing companies that's been saddled w/ regulations. In countries where regulatory arbitrage doesnt exist these 'innovators' fail, e.g., Uber in South Korea.
