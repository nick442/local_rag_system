You're making a political argument out of a mathematical truism. There is no difference between getting paid $100 more per month and having something that you routinely pay for become $100 per month cheaper for you. In both cases you have $100 more surplus income. There may be a slight difference in taxation and other finer details, but all things being equal it's the same thing.
