Proposed budge plan would limit any increase spent by the federal government on employee benefits. The amount paid would be limited to the rate of inflation. So if the cost of healthcare goes up 10% over time, and inflation goes up 2%, the employee and not the government picks up 8%. The result is that the government is protected from skyrocketing costs and can easily budget for the future. I guess the individual is thought to be more capable somehow? Of is the individual, and not the government, more responsible for skyrocketing profits in the drug industry? Or does the GOP believe the government needs less reason to care about individual people and more reason to side with large corporate profits? Or maybe the thinking is simply that there will be more money available for tax cuts. Perhaps newer good people will leave private industry to take lower paid federal jobs. But, maybe not as globalization seems to be dampening the compensation packages for all wage employees.
