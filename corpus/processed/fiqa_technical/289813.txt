Are you suggesting that the banks are using marketing to convince retail customers to buy financial products that they would not normally purchase due to the products' complexity? While that concerns is certainly valid, I believe it can be applied all the way down to the simplest of securities, e.g. stocks, or even assets, e.g. houses. That does not mean with should prohibit the sale of these products to retail customers.
