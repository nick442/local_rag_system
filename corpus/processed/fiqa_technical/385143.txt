I was responding to your assertion that there were not mass firings among the big banks. Since 2008, Wall Street has shrunken considerably, accounting for nearly 500,000 losses as of April (According to an analyst of the Labor Department data) and banks continue to shed its workforce in an effort to get lean. I work for one of 'the big 4'b so I can attest that it is an unpleasant environment. I can't compare it to the entire workforce, but I can tell you that you are absolutely wrong that there have not been mass firings.
