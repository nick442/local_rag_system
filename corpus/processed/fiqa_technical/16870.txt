well Russia is the biggest importer of meat and fruits from the EU. so yeah, it kinda hurts.. but I don't really think anything will change. once those sectors get hurt, subsidies will poor in so ppl won't lose jobs. sure it hurts, a bit, but on large scale it's rather a joke. on the other hand, 12 years ago when the US renamed French fries to freedom fries, and german imports were rejects for over 3 month, that was more childish than trade sanctions.
