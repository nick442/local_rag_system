You must not really understand how sales work. There isn't some magical list of people who want to hear about my product. There aren't very many ways to find a sizable amount of people who are in the market to make a purchase. To find people who are, I can cold call, advertise, and that's about it. Every successful company to ever exist started out cold calling potential clients to see if they wanted to purchase their product. The thing is, we don't care about finding people who don't want to purchase. We simply thank you for your time and move on. What we DO care about are the people who end up being interested in our product, and I can tell you this, every person who IS interested in our product is glad we called them. Plus, a cold call is not a sales call. A proper cold call is simply an informational call. The beginning of a business relationship. It is where you see if a person is interested or in need of the product you are selling and, if they are, you explain how your product can meet their need. We don't try to close the sale then and there. We simply inform. It's a highly effective way to find business, if you can handle being demonized by assholes like you.
