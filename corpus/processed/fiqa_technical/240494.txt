Have you ever BEEN to a Trader Joe's? Most of the stuff I buy there is as cheap or cheaper than if I'd gotten it at Walmart or another cheap grocery store..it's all store brand without the name brand mark up. If something is expensive (such as produce out of season; high cost meat such as lamb or seafood). Trader Joe's is run the way a grocery store SHOULD be run. People in Maine don't need oranges and people in Nebraska don't need sea bass to survive.
