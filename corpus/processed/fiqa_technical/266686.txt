Iamthewalrus is saying that longer commercials can just have longer quiet periods to bring down the average of your loud parts. Short commercials can't do this. I think the point is average is an imperfect measure because it doesn't capture the really loud parts. The main standard for normalizing the volume of music, ReplayGain, uses the 95th percentile of loudness - in other words, it looks at some of the loudest parts of a song/commercial to decide how loud it sounds to us. Empirical testing shows that we do indeed perceive loudness like this. More information: http://wiki.hydrogenaudio.org/index.php?title=ReplayGain_specification#Statistical_processing
