That has little or nothing to do with it. Workers don't matter enough to have policies actually crafted against them. Rather, policies are crafted without a thought towards workers. Once the robots get truly cheaper, in a Total-Cost-of-Ownership sense, workers will be replaced regardless of how well they do or do not supplicate themselves to their capital-holder masters. Working for $6 vs $14 per hour is just a way to possibly delay the inevitable for a little bit longer. $6 per hour in no way changes the inevitable outcome.
