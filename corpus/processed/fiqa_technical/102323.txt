what I'm saying is my meager 1600 gain could have incurred an extra $170 in taxes if there was no capital gains tax. It's basic math, not rocket science. that's just the numbers at my current tax bracket(25%) which isn't that high. I seriously don't get how you can't understand basic numbers and the fact that the capital gains tax is a huge advantage for a small time investor like me.
