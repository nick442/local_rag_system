Honestly I'm not sure what to expect since I've never been. The other guys have told me that they spent all day, everyday there and didn't see it all. I'd honestly like to find something within electric vehicles like ev chargers, 3D Printing, some new type of mobile phone integration. I have a desire to go real big when finding potential opportunities, but I'm also expecting to mostly find smaller/less scalable opportunities that will allow us to build a portfolio of businesses.
