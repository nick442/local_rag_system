"It seems this will be very much driven by price discrimination. If there are some customers who will pay up to $100, sell at that; and if there are others who'll pay $1 sell at that price. For instance you see computer games, which have zero marginal cost of production, sold at ""normal new release"" prices, at premium prices with a special box or doo-dad, and at discount prices once the game is a bit old."
