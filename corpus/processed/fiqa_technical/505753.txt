I disagree. We had significantly less debt during the opening stages of WWII than we have now. I have no doubt that if we had more debt back then it would have factored into our contribution to the war effort, just as our current level of debt is factoring into our contribution to the powder keg sh*t basket that is the middle east right now. That's my point! You can't create infinite money, so if you've already created a crap ton of money, it will affect your decision to create another crap ton of money! Idk whether it's a straw man or not but we both think the govt can do more. If you disagree with me that there are limits to how much the government can spend, then I am just at a loss, honestly. I want to know, concretely and in precise terms, what the limits are in real time so that we can adjust our policy response accordingly
