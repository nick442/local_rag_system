"Lmao so the fact that the government ""could possibly switch currency"" negates the current demand they create? The government creates a demand for USD. That alone is enough to say dollars have intrinsic value. Add to that the fact that there are trillions of dollars in outstanding government bonds that are required to be paid out in USD when they mature. Changing the currency would be considered a form of default by many and could have massive negative consequence far outweighing the benefits of the rapid adoption of blockchain. Even if they stopped issuing bonds today they would still have ones maturing until 2047. It's like saying bananas don't have monetary value because people might decide to stop buying them. Yeah, it's true they would lose value if that happened but as of today it's just not true"
