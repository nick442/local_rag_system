I am a financial analyst now for a fortune 500 company, about to graduate a rotational program. Every company has financial analysts, and finance is a great field to be in right now. Think about what you would want in an analyst. Math, stats, strong writing and analytical skills, proven experience (internships) and desire to learn are great. I interned at a bank and defense contractor and attempted to start a small business in college, speaking to what I learned was what helped me during interviews
