Still I wonder, and please explain my wrongness. If Greece started a building project, that would pay a group of workers, the workers would get money to pay for their demand (the crisis is not led by demand, rather by lack of private money, yes?). Now this money starts to circulate and different factories suddenly get paid more, because the workers are buying stuff. To keep up with this new demand, the factories employ new workers, which in turn, get paid and then buys more stuff from other companies. I know this is very simplistic, but why would it not work this way if the government started building projects?
