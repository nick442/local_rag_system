I have worked in positions at different parts of the bid process, as a materials tech/drafter there is subsurface surveys, geotechnical reports, environmental impact studies, waterway studies for the Army Corps of Engineers, the surface surveys. As drafter for the steel supplier for bridges there were engineering documents, detail drawings that needed engineering approvals. Then finally as a project manager for the GC you have to have a staff of engineers and administrative professionals to keep track. Even if everything goes well there will be something unexpected that will happen and that could be environmental concerns that lead to court time or finding in unmarked grave out on the prairie so then you need to get archeologists to properly care for the remains. So many little things compile to form big delays.
