I guarantee you that this won't put a kabosh on the problem for all of retail. I work in a specialty cheese shop located inside a grocery store. For most cheeses, we tag pieces that are cut off of a wheel for 30 days. This is not a use-by date, in any way. This is simply a good estimate for how long it will *look* fresh. The actual use by date varies by cheese, and is typically several *weeks* later then the date you'll see on the label (longest being about a month). Fact is that most customers just don't buy product that doesn't look damn perfect, and a piece of cheese simply looks worse after 30 days of sitting under display lights (bleaching) and being handled every day. For packaged Nestle shit this will work fine, but for fresh cut or specialty items? Nah. Y'all just won't buy it.
