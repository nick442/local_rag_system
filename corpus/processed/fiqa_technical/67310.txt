They wouldn't exist in the first place, the government creates them. 90% of all antitrust litigation is one private firm suing another, i.g., government created/enabled cartels. Antitrust laws do exactly the opposite of what they (supposedly) intended, and they are generally a failed and discredited policy. Any surprise? Isn't that what most government intervention does?
