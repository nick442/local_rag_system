Question: Why are the mortgage rates so high in northern Alabama? We tried to get prequalified for a $130,000 home and was told our monthly payments would be $890/month. With some simple math (i have no financial knowledge of the situation), that puts our ending payout at over twice what the home is worth, at over $320,000! Why?
