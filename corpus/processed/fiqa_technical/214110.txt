"I'd imagine they would find something wrong like ""too many choices are confusing to the consumer"".

As one of the examples is http://www.dslreports.com/shownews/Verizon-ATT-Lobby-to-Weaken-FCC-Spectrum-Authority-118302. I was pleasantly surprised however when the tmobil at&t merger was blocked."
