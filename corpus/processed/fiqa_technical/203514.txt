Everyone always rants on how big of a problem this is. Just a quick note, I don't care how much they get paid, but it's important to understand why. It isn't because they set their own salaries, or that they are all super greedy. Their pay is meant to solve an agency problem. The CEO doesn't own the company, the public does. Because of that the CEO has little incentive to act in the best interests of the owners, rather than his own interest. So their pay is structured in a way that solves this problem. They are paid based on how well their company does, and how much shareholder value they create. This aligns their interests with the shareholders. Is this the best solution? Probably not. Is there a better one? Probably. Do I know it? No. But mindlessly complaining about the result doesn't solve the issue. The issue is we need a good solution for the agency problem in an economic system that is built on public ownership and private management.
