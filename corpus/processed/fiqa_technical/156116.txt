Companies will keep their wages as low as possible and would rather sacrifice the quality of people, hiring incapable/ ill-suited people. Then in order to further reduce costs many corporate offices will pass down that payroll needs to be reduced, so those people who couldn't do one person's job then do the job of two or three. Then burn out quickly and the cycle repeats. Been in service too long. You see this everywhere.
