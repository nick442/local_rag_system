Okay what I meant was that if you catch someone and find out they own a certain address, they cannot escape the trail. If they want to move funds from a criminal wallet to a safe wallet, there will always be a trail. And that's just the transaction network. The stock market equivalent counterparty operates on a similar ledger system. > the parallel is clear Except that with blockchain technology its 100% transparent and global by default and doesn't need a third party to audit the system because its all done algorithmically and openly. Also no need for a clearing house or companies to give you access to the stock market through their services (like e trade).
