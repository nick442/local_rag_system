Mismanaged companies are a commodity that can be turned into profitable companies. Companies like Bain invest in companies that would probably go bankrupt otherwise, shuffle things around (usually firing some people, sometimes a lot), and sell the company to someone now that it's profitable at an exorbitant rate. I don't like many investors outsource to China, but when a private equity firm gets involved with your company, those jobs don't have long to begin with.
