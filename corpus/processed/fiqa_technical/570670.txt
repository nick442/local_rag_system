"I'm not sure you can get a refund. In the US, companies aren't required by law to offer one. You could contact GoDaddy's customer service and ask them, but I would guess that they'll agree with the contents of the legal agreement. Unless there is another part of the agreement that does allow you to get a refund (there might be, I haven't read it), you're probably out of luck. And yes, this is legitimate. It's a legal agreement, and by checking the box (if there was one), going through with the purchase, etc. you indicated that you read and agreed to the legal agreement, and therefore accepted that you wouldn't be offered a refund. GoDaddy isn't responsible if someone purchases something from them without reading the agreement before agreeing to it. Furthermore, the legal agreement isn't the only place where the refund policy is stated. GoDaddy's page, ""What is Domain Buy Service?"" says: Your purchase is non-refundable and non-transferable. This is a help page, not something you explicitly agree to (and therefore not legally binding), but as a lesson for the future, always read the description of what you're purchasing before you purchase it. For general reference: if for some reason you were the victim of fraud, e.g. a company offered a refund in their legal agreement but refused to give it you, and you paid with a credit card, you have more options because you could work with your credit card company to potentially get your money back. In this case, however, the agreement was clear, so this isn't an option."
