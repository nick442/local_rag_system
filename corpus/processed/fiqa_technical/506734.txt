It's quite possible that everyone should only work 3 days a week according to this study. I managed to track down the actual study, which you can read [here](http://melbourneinstitute.unimelb.edu.au/downloads/working-paper-series/wp2016n07.pdf). One point most people are unaware of is that this study did *not* compare people over age 40 with those under age 40. It only studied those age 40 or over. [See Table II](https://i.imgur.com/KObJ29z.png). So.. 3 days a week for everyone..?
