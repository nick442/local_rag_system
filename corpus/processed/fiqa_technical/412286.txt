Your statement makes it clear that you have no idea whatsoever how money circulates through the economy. Pray tell, what percentage of U.S. GDP is consumer spending? You completely failed to grasp the relevant parts of the hypothetical scenario. The takeaway was that if 1 person has the same amount of income as several thousand people, the several thousand people will spend a vastly higher percentage of that same number. The rich don't have to spend their income. The poor and masses spend most of their income. To your comment about someone making $50k and spending $45k needing to improve their financial decision making.. Well yea. But that's not the reality we have in America. I don't have the exact number handy, but you do realize that there are over 100 million people in this country who are not able to save $5,000 a year, correct? I wasn't making any sort of statement on what I think the proper tax rate should be on the wealthy, I was just telling you (along with everyone else here) that the rich don't spend as much of their incomes as the rest of society. But since you asked, probably 43% on income north of $700,000.
