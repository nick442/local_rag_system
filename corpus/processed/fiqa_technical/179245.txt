"Great writing, Ellen Brown. I wish the Argentinians all the best in stinging the vulture funds and doing a successful end run on the IMF. Clearly, Argentina is not the bad guy in all this, despite some people trying to make them appear as such, by regurgitating the convenient Financialese spin. On a different note, there is an interesting history lesson concerning the Baring Bank Economic Crisis of 1890 related to or rather caused by poor Baring Bank investments in Argentina, which were so massive that the debts had to be bank rolled by the British Government since, as is has become usual ever since, it threatened to bring down the hole (British) financial system which was then the world's debtor of last resort. ""Plus ça change, plus c’est la même chose"", etc."
