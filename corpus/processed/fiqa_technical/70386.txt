Read his press release. It's bullshit 90% of time. Musk trying to push meme that solar roof are cheaper than regular shingle when in fact it's 10 times more expensive. Model 3 is selling for $35,000 base is a joke. It needs $5000 autopilot upgrade, $1500 paint upgrade to be competitive. Model 3 begin production this week yet strangely all cars are sold to Tesla employees for testing. Telsa can't even solve it [ridiculous parking problem](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4403480/Tesla-parking-nightmare-employees-California.html). I don't have faith in the manufacturing quality of their products.
