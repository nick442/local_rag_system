Yes I would be pissed, NO someone should not go to jail just because I am pissed and they made a horrible negligent decision with money that people trusted to them. Someone *should* go to jail if they broke a law. From your description, it sounds like they did. I'm still not convinced though until you can tell me where these strict regulations are and what they say.
