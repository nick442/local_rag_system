So the Facebook IPO thus far has been a bomb. People have rightly criticized the company for all sorts of things. This got me thinking about what people were saying about Google just before its IPO. So I used Google's wonderful search filter and searched for 'google ipo' and I set the time frame to be the 6 weeks leading up to Google's IPO on August 19, 2004. Some of the articles are fantastic. Below are some links to a couple of BusinessWeek articles. They were really not feeling Google back then.
