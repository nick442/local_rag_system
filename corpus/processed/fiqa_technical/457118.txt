Funny that this shows up on my feed right now.. I installed ICQ a couple of months ago. I put it on my 7 year old son's iPad first, using his mum's phone number (we're divorced). It is really the best way we can communicate quickly as she doesn't often let him pick up the phone and call - for whatever reason. But, at 7, watching him send me messages and spell out words, it's amazing. I haven't used ICQ in years, but it worked very well for our purposes and made me very happy. As I'm typing this right now (no BS), someone from Indonesia has just started to message and converse with me (Canada). Just like the old days when people used to randomly message others around the world to say hello and get to know what they were about, and what life was like (I have 20+ years online with things like this, so it's bringing back a lot of memories lol). It's much different than what you experience in many other apps.. ads, local singles, etc. I'm glad that it's growing again.. nostalgic for a lot of people!
