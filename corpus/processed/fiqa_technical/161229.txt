"Yes, you really budget from ""net."" After all deductions on one's paycheck, it's not tough to wind up with 60% left, making the 30% of gross fully half of what you net. The unasked question is whether this is a good budgeting tool. I think it really isn't. If you can find a place to rent that's a walk from your job, and that rent saves you the full cost of car ownership as well as the hour round trip each day your co-worker commutes, you might justify 50%. ""Rules of thumb"", nearly all of them, should be taken with a grain of salt. Show me your budget, and I'll know what your priorities are. Your budget is what's right for you, but as a PF blogger, I hope there's a line item for retirement savings, and another for fun."
