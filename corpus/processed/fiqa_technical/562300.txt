Don't borrow money to buy a car. That is just stupid. People who save, then buy what they want, spend a very much larger amount of money over their lifetime, compared to a person with the exact same income, who borrows to buy things. The only difference between the two, is the time it takes to save up that first amount of money. After that there is no difference, except the savers spend a shit-ton more money, and get better stuff.
