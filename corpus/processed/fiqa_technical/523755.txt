I had an amazing customer service experience with Best Buy yesterday. I walked into my local BB with a list of computer components for a PC I am building (I was purchasing from New Egg and Best Buy). Wandered around and an employee saw me (he ended up being the manager), and he helped me put together an order, not only that but he checked New Egg to make sure I was getting competitive prices, not only that but he made sure I was getting free shipping. On top of that he went through my New Egg list and price matched anything they had. Now I only need a couple more things from New Egg. Thought I'd share.
