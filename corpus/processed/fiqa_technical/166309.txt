Same position as you, took it in December. I scored extremely well and got 8 requests for my resume. 2 were ops/hr related, 3 were really small HF's, 2 were mid sized prop trading firms. I had accepted a job a month prior, so I put no effort in in following up other than giving them access to my resume. Personally I really think I could've gotten interviews if I had immediately started networking with people in the company as soon as I got the resume requests. The test is a bit of a combination between the GMAT/SAT/GRE and the CFA imo.
