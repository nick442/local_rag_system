"You want culture shock, and can afford the week vacation or whatever - go from Detroit/Kzoo to Ashland, OR. Literally scared the shit out of me. People were nice, and I didn't have to worry about getting stomped by cops, and just..yeah. Was baffled the whole time, asking myself: ""There's really places like this in America? No wonder people say everything they do about Detroit."" Felt almost ashamed to be me wandering around there, having grown up in the shithole area I did."
