"Frankly, I was just listing off reasons that I and others might be pissed off at our landlords. Yeah, I've lived in student-focused housing too, and student rentals suck balls. Hell, that's the reason I wound up in the ""upscale"" city of Cambridge instead of living in the ""cheaper"" young-people areas of Allston or Brighton: because those places have had their rents pushed up by students *way* beyond what it's worth paying for a tiny, near-windowless, roach-infested hole built in the 1940s with rats running free in the streets. And yeah, I understand that those places suck so bad because many students are shitty tenants. But my real point was: my landlord doesn't provide me a place to live, he charges me ever-increasing rent for a place to live that he didn't build, maintains to the minimum required by the lease, and doesn't ever upgrade."
