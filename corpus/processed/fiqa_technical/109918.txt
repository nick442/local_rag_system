"I understand that, but in a field where so many do go by DJ [insert name] it can be a little off. I agree in almost any other case it wouldn't make any difference. When it comes to performers I think it's better to have their name accurately displayed, as it is their brand they are representing. Not a big deal, really. Just thought it was weak to not notice that when researching the piece. I think ""electronic artist"", ""musician"" or something else in that vein would have been better. Then again, I work in that industry so I'm probably just being nitpicky. **Edited for grammar**"
