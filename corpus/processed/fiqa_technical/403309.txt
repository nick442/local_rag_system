"I disagree. My parents, boomers, and their parents, depression era, have all told me that ""social security is going bankrupt!"" has been a major political talking point right from the start. There has not yet been a generation who was in their 20s who hasn't gotten that messaging. There have always been what seemed like legitimate threats, but social security really is somewhat of a case of ""too big to fail,"" and provided the wingnut crowd doesn't get crowned ruling council of the country and gut it, there's simply no way SS will be allowed to go under. Not with what a massive political force AARP and 55+ special interest groups are in the US. They are more massive on our political landscape than most people realize. But I digress. The idea that SS won't be around in 50 years is how it's always been."
