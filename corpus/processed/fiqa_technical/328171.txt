Hi, finance degree holder here. Graduated in 2012, been working in retail ever since. Almost went homeless twice. Unless you know for sure 100% that you want to go to grad school and/or get a few (expensive) certifications, the only shot at gainful employment you have is in insurance sales. Or at major firms if you're close to a big city. Ymmv, and a lot depends on the area, but I didn't exactly have a good time.
