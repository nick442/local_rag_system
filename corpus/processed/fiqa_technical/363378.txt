"You definitely do want to avoid losing money on repeated currency conversions. Remember they are making a profit every time you change your currency. A money market fund is basically like a 'savings account' mutual fund. They are open like mutual funds, in that you can buy or sell at any time. There don't tend to be fees of any kind (directly) as all management is paid for out of the interest/returns that the fund generates. So using a money market fund to hold the ""cash"" portion of your TFSA or any other account for that matter would be a normal (and ""free"") thing to do. Good Luck"
