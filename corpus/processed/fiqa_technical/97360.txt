Doesn't surprise me :- * a ton of reality TV , much of it low quality and booring . * a dearth of quality creativity - not much decent new series etc. . * a lot of sequels and remakes - not much originals . * a lot of poor quality news and poor quality journalism . * a lot of people pushing personal , political and commercial agendas . A general lack of professionalism and objectivity . * an overall lack of quality . Basically the choice is between a few channels of crap and a ton of channels of crap . Most of the time I'm reading the Internet rather than watching the TV .
