I think a shirt with French cuffs that require cufflinks is a good way to show any conservative workplace that you know how they roll. However if you are just an intern it might make you look very stuffy. I say do it if you are over 20. And practice tying your tie so the taper to the point starts at the belt buckle. You don't want to see the top shirt button, and you don't want to see any shirt below the tie. Last thing, leave the bottom button of the suit unbuttoned at all times. So if it is a three button suit, never ever touch button three. Also, you may unbutton your suit when you sit down, rebutton it up when you stand up. If you sit down with buttons done up sometimes it scrunches up a bit around the shoulders.
