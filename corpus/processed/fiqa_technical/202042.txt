Maybe it's just me, but if I notice a car 3 times, driving around with STEVE'S PLUMBING on it with a phone number. I'll remember huh, if I ever wanted plumbing, this steve guy seems to get around a lot, he must be good. Especially if I like the design. Remembering the phone number, yeah that's not going to happen, but having it there makes me think he wants my business, which makes me more like to look for him when I need a plumber. If I see him driving around, he must be local. If the email is logical like stevesplumbing@gmail.com, I *might* remember it, but at the end of the day I'm opening the web browser/yellow pages to google the name STEVE'S PLUMBING anyway, so I'll never bother emailing. I prefer phones. Also my Mum keeps business cards of tradesmen she likes and sticks them on the inside of a cabinet door, along with take out places, ect. So if I ever needed a plumber I would go there. I'm saying advertising to end customers may not be directly effective, but I would still try.
