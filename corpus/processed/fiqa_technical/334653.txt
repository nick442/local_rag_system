"The rate difference between your student loans and the historical yearly average growth in the S&P500 isn't large enough for me to play the ""pay minimums and invest the rest"" strategy. If your loans were 2%, I might think about it. However, the 4% loans are guaranteed and mandatory expenses; discharging them even in bankruptcy is unlikely. The quicker you pay them off, the sooner you won't have them hanging over your head in case of a ""financial setback"" (job loss, large expense uncovered by insurance, etc). (One good reason to pay the minimums, though, is to build up a $1K emergency fund. When your debts are paid, then you can increase its size.)"
