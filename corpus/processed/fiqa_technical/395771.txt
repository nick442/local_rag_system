Right. It couldn't have anything to do with the fact that the tax code is thousands of pages long and so complex that even most tax attorneys probably don't understand it in its entirety, let alone the average tax payer. There couldn't be *any* flaw in the system *except* that Bill Gates and Warren Buffett don't just fund the government all by themselves.
