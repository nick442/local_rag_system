I agree. Since the Fed has been pursing all kinds of aggressive policies for years it saying things have gotten worse damages their reputation. This means it's either so clear it can't be ignored or is the first step in some other strong measures (leaving QE in place?). Either way, the fact the Fed is saying this is significant.
