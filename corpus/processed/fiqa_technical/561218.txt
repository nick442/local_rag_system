"This is one of those ""no shit"" articles. It's buried about halfway down that article, but then you find the concession that, among the group of working age men who were not working and using opiates, they found a large number had serious injuries and were taking pain medication, under a doctor's care, to manage that. They also concede that the rates of disability is substantially higher among working-age men as well, and that frequently requires pain management -- and whether it's managed with ultram or heroin it's all counted the same in the article (and likely the paper, but I can't read it at the moment). Further, since it restricts this to not in the labor force rather than unemployed + not in the labor force, two things happen: first, the public perceives it to be higher and more problematic because they think ""unemployed"" not ""non-participant"", and second it includes those who are undergoing chemo, hospitalized and dying, or otherwise under constant medical care that may *also* require pain management. It's not nearly as instructive as if this had included a breakout for the unemployed. The paper is interesting and necessary, but this isn't really news."
