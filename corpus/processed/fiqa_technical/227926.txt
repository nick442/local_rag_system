The math depends on your average bill, days before it's due, and interest you'd earn. Say you have a $2000 bill each month. At 1%, there's an annual $20 or 40 cents per week you'd save by delaying the payment. If you pay on line and can hit the due date dead on, no reason to pay sooner. But if you risk the mail being late, the late fee and interest will negate the savings on a hundred months of last minute payments. Hardly worth the risk, IMHO. Edit - to clarify, the delayed payment with the above numbers saves the 40 cents or about $5/yr. scale it up with higher average balances or with a higher return on your savings account.
