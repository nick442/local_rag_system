I applied for a job a was literally perfectly qualified for. My educational background was exactly what it described, my work history was spot on, and my internship experience was DOING THAT JOB. I got an email two weeks later saying I wasn't qualified. So now I just get jobs through connections. My own merits apparently don't mean anything.
