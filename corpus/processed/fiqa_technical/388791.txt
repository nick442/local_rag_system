I don't know where you're coming up with this. The deficit right now is about $440 billion vs the well over 1 trillion is social expenditures. There are bloated budgets and inefficiencies everywhere in government. Cuts could easily be made. Then there's the fact that we have a GDP of 18.57 trillion yet you think that there are 500 companies with 1 trillion in profit?
