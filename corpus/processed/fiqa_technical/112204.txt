No, because that would be just as unsutainable. I'm saying that in terms of effect on cost inflation in this sector, single payer doesn't help any more than the current system in the US. Any time you pay for services with a financial product that fails to apply downward pressure on prices, you will see skyrocketing costs, just like we saw in the housing bubble, and like we are seeing now with college tuition and health care.
