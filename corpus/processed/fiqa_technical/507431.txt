'We were encouraged en masse to apply to university, told a degree would guarantee us a good job, as long as we worked hard and did well.' This is what is really aggravating me, I worked hard and did very well, and am about to graduate my masters with a pile of job rejections. I mean I know no one 'owes me anything', but when I was in secondary school, a lot was promised, and I hardly think having a large portion of well educated young people jobless, or in unskilled labour is anywhere near an efficient use of human resource, let alone the misery that goes along side it. (I really needed a little bit of venting)
