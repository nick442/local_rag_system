They help fund road projects that would otherwise require an increase in the fuel tax. A large enough project, like a new limited access freeway, will cost hundreds of millions to construct. So they float some bonds that will be paid off with toll revenue. Lots of times after the bonds have been paid off the state has the options to remove the toll and put the road back in the pool with all the other roads. Of course, governments very rarely voluntarily relinquish a revenue stream. For example, here in Georgia we only have one toll road ([GA400](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_State_Route_400) in Atlanta) despite having 10 million residents. How do you justify increasing fuel taxes on residents hundreds of miles away on the coast for a transportation project that only benefits Atlanta commuters? You cannot thus tolls.
