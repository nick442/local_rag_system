I read the text, it is a bit confusing but it seems like they are trying to limit it to 500k per person (the 1% is BS IMO) not for the whole class. Still, not sure limits are appropriate here but its not a complete walk away for the company. Me thinks they are tying to keep equifax from going under in a worst case. Which IMO, they should be shut down.
