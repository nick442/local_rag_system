As a boston resident, these stores will be jam packed this weekend. The store i go to has 20 lanes 5-6 customers deep from opening on friday to close, and it looks like that almost every weekend day. The customers are of every socio economic and racial background. Market basket has whole foods quality food at 35-40% of the cost. They lost a ton of money but will be fine.
