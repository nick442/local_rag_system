Imo this subject is about as black & white as slavery. Hmm what does society think.. Is it okay to own slaves? Well what if you treat them well, then its alright then, right? Then how about an extremely expensive health care system that hurts more people than it helps, thats ok because it helps a few people, right? Shame on our narcissistic leaders.
