"I don't think AirBnB should be regulated in that way. And look, there are far fewer problems with Airbnb than with hotels and motels. And without the need of government intrusion! Why? Because Airbnb's reputation model works far better than the ""government will make everyone okay"" model. I've stayed at a lot of hotels, and I would take ANY Airbnb I've stayed at over a hotel any day! Airbnb is a perfect example of the free market working just fine. The government is ONLY wanting to get involved because of the hotel lobby. Hotels are a multi-billion dollar industry, and if anyone thinks that they are just going to bend over and take it from Airbnb they they're a fool. They are fighting back with the use of ""native ads"" like this. Along with support from politicians who will sell out to any industry associations willing to line their campaign coffers. This is an industry fight. It's about old dying industries fighting the new economy, and entrepreneurs. Its nasty, underhanded, and full of lies. Cracked just totally lost me with this ""fake news."""
