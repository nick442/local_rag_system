Amazon just delayed my entrance into e-books for a few years. First off, the prices are still crazy, and secondly, now you dont even own the shit you pay the same price as a paperback for. They are managing to remove all of the benefits of going digital. I think they may be screwing themselves long term with these moves, publishers with integrity are going to start going around them.distributing e-books is very easy.
