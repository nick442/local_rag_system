Would I be taxed at my personal income tax rate upon withdrawal of the funds for this loan from my professionally managed, balanced 401k (not Roth funds)? Yes. This is a regular distribution. Why wouldn't you be taxed? What's gifting has to do with anything? If taxable, this would move me to the next higher tax bracket. Depending on your other income - it may, or may not. Whether or not taxable when pulling funds out of the investment account, when I'm repaid, do I owe Federal tax only on the interest income portion of repayment funds or on the lump sum & interest received (all of which which would return to my retirement account in lump)? Only interest. And you will not return it to your retirement account. Not in a lump and not in installments and not in any other way.
