"Don't listen to the retarded ""do-gooder"" idiots on this site who think she shouldn't reneg because of some honor or morality bullshit. You have a contract between two people. It states what will happen when you pay (keep car) and what will happen when you don't (they take car). Defaulting isn't an inherent bad thing. There are consequences for it. If you decide to default or to not pay a loan and you're ok with the consequences then do it. The person writing the loan knows the risk they're getting into and they're ok with it. So do what is best for you. As for your original question, sorry I don't have an answer. I don't think anything will happen to her in the U.S. but she might have trouble later on if she decides to move back to Japan or even visit Japan. Or her family may be held accountable for it. No idea. I don't know how Japanese laws works. Hopefully someone here will help but the best thing would be to talk to a lawyer in both the U.S. and in Japan."
