No. There's no personal responsibility per se if you set up a corporation, but if you don't have a track record a creditor will likely insist that you personally guarantee the debts of the corporation. Beyond that, personal responsibility would be the result of a piercing of the corporate veil, which is something the courts are unlikely to do unless there is indicia of fraud or the like. There are also some statutory provisions that can lead to personal liability of a corporation's directors (e.g. unpaid wages), but I don't think that's really what this thread is getting at.
