I read a great article on LinkedIn that claimed (with some stats) that a huge amount of employees are chosen before the job goes to advert. I'm not saying that's the case here, but i think having an 'in' is definitely useful! Is there a contact for an informal discussion? Hope i'm not too late in replying, and good luck!
