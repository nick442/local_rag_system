">A) This ain't trolling. This shit is knowledge. I'm seriously not trying to troll anyone. I do not feel there is enough appreciation or attention given to the many many many people sold a bill of goods. These poor dumb fucks I play FF with, working in downtown Boston or NYC, paying $2000 a month in rent for the privilege of earning $30K a year. They got good grades as Finance majors? They're literally in the bottom 1% of that stratification then. Your anecdote is worthless; the data I provided tells the exact opposite story. >B) My vendetta is that it is nonsense. All of it. It is the same five fucking ideas rehashed, repackaged and resold to the next generation of idiots over and over and over again. It is literally NOTHING interesting, and it is WAY too many people clamoring for the same piece of a pie they didn't bake. Rampant ignorance of a topic you don't undertand. >C) Maybe you are the tallest midget, but maybe you should just not choose to be a midget. You still have not provided an alternative field of study, just ""finance = bad."""
