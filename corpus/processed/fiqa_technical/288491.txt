This is surprising, I'm not sure if they do this anymore. I got an overdraft fee a couple months when they tried to pay the balance on my CC. I had plenty in savings to cover it. I called and argued with them because they re-ran the draft to pay the CC the next day too, when they should have been well aware there weren't funds in the checking account, but they wouldn't do anything about it. The first time I've ever had a gripe with them.
