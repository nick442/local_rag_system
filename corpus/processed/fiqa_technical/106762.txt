You will see self driving full size semi trucks before you own a personal self driving car. The efficiencies will be much greater for a big rig, vs small car or van. Right now, HOS limits time a driver can spend behind the wheel. Without team drivers, the truck sits idle for 60-70+% of the time. Large truck companies will see the benefit of owning less assets, paying less for whatever fuel they will be using, and increasing the general efficiency of their operations.
