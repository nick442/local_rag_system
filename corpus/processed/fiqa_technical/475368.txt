The way I see it is - we do know that meat production is inefficient and resource intensive. It is more environmentally damaging than alternatives, and there is something to be said for killing tens of billions of animals of a year when it is in fact not necessary. So even if low carb - or high meat diets did have similar health benefits to vegan diets when done ‘right’ it still isn’t a logical diet for a large population to follow because of its wider implications.
