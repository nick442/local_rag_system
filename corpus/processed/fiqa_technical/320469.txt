"> You are in an endless loops of ""maybe""(s).. No, my point was that **your** ""maybe"" puts **you** in an endless loop of ""maybe""s. Please try to keep up. > But the paranoia and ""end of the world"" folks do not impress me. Me neither but that doesn't mean global warming is not going to bring a whole lot of expense and instability. > With science we will be able to control the weather on earth easily. Easily!! Ha! You have no idea of the scale of the problem with weather and climate. > You can't come with one ACTION by Trump you oppose, and you are still against him. Now you're [moving the goalposts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_the_goalposts). You first wanted something President Trump ""did"" that I oppose and I gave you two examples. Since you can't dismiss his positions you now claim I can't come up with ""one ACTION"". Okay, fine. Here are about a dozen *categories* of reasons I do not support President Trump. I can come up with at least a dozen examples in each category: * He is a liar. * He is unpresidential. * He is a narcissist. * He demonstrates his mental abilities are average at best. * He holds himself accountable for nothing yet is quick to blame people around him. * He is unprofessional, airing dirty laundry and not treating professionals with respect. * His White House makes intellectually dishonest if not straight up false claims. * His strength is in dividing people, not unifying them. * He is using the presidency to enrich his family, friends, and himself. * He has no understanding/appreciation of the checks and balances of government. * He is inept with foreign relations. * He is reactionary, acting off the cuff and revealing that he does not have long-term plans. * He has demonstrated he works for the rich, not the average American. I should put ""He is a liar"" in bold because there are so many more categories I want to add that full under that umbrella.
