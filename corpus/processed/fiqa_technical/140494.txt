Mods of /r/finance how many times are we going to see this advertisement? /u/sciencegames [won't even explain the program](https://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/6rhha4/upenn_research_finance_challenge_earn_up_to_20/dl7mn55/). This is just an ad for some grad student's project. This is the third time i've seen this thread reposted in two months. What's it going to be, 2 more times? 5 more times? Do you have some limit in mind?
