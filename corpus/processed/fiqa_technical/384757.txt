I wouldn't doubt it. Apparently the oil pipeline to transfer oil from Iran to China through Pakistan has already been built, just needs to be activated, just needs the go ahead now. As for US track record, yeah, they have very bad one and it's only getting worse. I suspect the GOP will blame a lot of this on Obama on their next run for presidency and then they will blunder even more. Coincidently as well, a lot of people will say Russian or any non-western sources of news are not reliable because it's propaganda yet they are the western medias not spewing their on propaganda?
