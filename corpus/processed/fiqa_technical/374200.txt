"It isn't just Fox News. Even liberal leaning sources like the Washington Post, ABC and the Seattle Times are using titles like ""A ‘very credible’ new study on Seattle’s $15 minimum wage has bad news for liberals"" and ""New study of Seattle's $15 minimum wage says it costs jobs"" Now here are some citations from the actual study (which you obviously didn't read or you wouldn't have made the asinine comment above) ""Importantly, the lost income associated with the hours reductions exceeds the gain associated with the net wage increase of 3.1%. Using data in Table 3, we compute that the average low-wage employee was paid $1,897 per month. The reduction in hours would cost the average employee $179 per month, while the wage increase would recoup only $54 of this loss, leaving a net loss of $125 per month (6.6%), which is sizable for a low-wage worker."" ""Our preferred estimates suggest that the Seattle Minimum Wage Ordinance **caused hours worked by low-skilled workers (i.e., those earning under $19 per hour) to fall by 9.4%** during the three quarters when the minimum wage was $13 per hour, resulting in a loss of 3.5 million hours worked per calendar quarter. Alternative estimates show the number of low-wage jobs declined by 6.8%, which represents a loss of more than 5,000 jobs. These estimates are robust to cutoffs other than $19.45 **A 3.1% increase in wages in jobs that paid less than $19 coupled with a 9.4% loss in hours yields a labor demand elasticity of roughly -3.0**"" I understand if you won't respond. It is scary having your liberal narrative shattered."
