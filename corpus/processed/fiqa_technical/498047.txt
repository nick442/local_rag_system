>Is your argument that the US Government is here illegally? >answering my question with a question it's a simple yes or no. The drug dealer in your example is the rightful owner of the property, hence why that other person living there and eating their food is making a voluntary choice to live there. You used this to compare to a person living in the US. Implying that the Federal Government is the rightful owner of the entire 'property' of the united states. Is this what you are saying? yes or no? Also, who came first, the people, or the US Federal Government? >Okay, so lets add that the drug dealer / gang banger is living in that house because he murdered the prior owner.. does that make your living in the house more or less implicit approval of the drug dealers decisions and lifestyle?
