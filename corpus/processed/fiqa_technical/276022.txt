I agree. I prefer to speak about topics, not each other. However, when people like CuilRunnings break from topics and start getting personal, I sometimes assume that is the road they wish to travel, and I go along for a short stroll. In this case, the path is predictable and I've already decided to get back on topic. The truth is often simple. Getting the truth to conform to what we want it to be is what makes it complex.
