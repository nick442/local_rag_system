>Would you take on somebody if you seriously thought this was going to happen? Would any small enterprise ever hire anyone? Equality is a nice idea but it will stifle small and slow growing businesses to the point where the only way to get started will be to take a big loan. And that is not in the interests of the economy at large. Don't worry, there is a large number of people out there who, if they get their way, would make it illegal not to hire these people. I'm all for workers' rights, but once the pendulum swings so far in favor of the employee that it becomes detrimental to hire them unemployment is going to go up.
