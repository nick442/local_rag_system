"So, the soviet union purchases its own debt, and this is a shining example of a historical empire that worked in your mind? Come on man, you aren't that fucking stupid are you? You don't need me to explain why that is a very, very incorrect choice do you? I asked you to name an empire, historically, that purchased its own debt and was successful in doing so. You have still yet to do that. And btw, there are many, many different forms of ""fallacies"", don't be a redditor and only learn one. Ad hominem is the same thing as saying personal attacks, and its pretty overused on this site."
