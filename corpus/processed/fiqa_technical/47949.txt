Wow that is really great that you have such an amazing organization. Unfortunately I don't believe that I will get the financial support I need to start one up myself. I was going to start a Kickstarter campaign but people on Reddit didn't even see it happening so I think I will keep dreaming for now. I do have some rough ideas in mind and have looked into some real estate as well but the financial obstacle is something that will be too hard to come over. Thanks so much for reaching out though.
