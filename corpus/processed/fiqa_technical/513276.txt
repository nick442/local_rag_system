"This is simple tech, but I used Amazon Fresh Pickup a few times. The second time I went I wanted to tell the attendant my order number or my name. He just said, oh we know already, it's coming up. And I just need to tell him whether I want the bags in the back or the trunk. They collected my license plate info via a reader at the stall and already tied it to my account. There's actually a 4 stage ""loading bar"" indicator that tells you the status right in front of where you park and wait at the stall. I was pretty amazed. One bar is they read your car plate or got your order number. Two is someone is getting your stuff. Three is the bags are on the way out. Four is time to drive away."
