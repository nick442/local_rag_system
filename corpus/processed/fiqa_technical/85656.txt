"Is this subreddit anti-MBA? I think this notion written by the author is nothing new. It's been said a hundred times by those in the valley and has been regurgitated by thousands more who are not really sure why they are saying it. Personally I think when you make such a comment or even support it you need to think about the industry the person wishes to enter. If they are going for something in the tech industry, fine, I'm not going to argue against that because that industry is build on matchsticks that seems to run around ridiculous business models aimed at fast exits. Did I offend someone in the tech industry with that comment..I hope so. Now if you're going into other fields that require some serious capital (e.g., medical, energy, telecommunications) then the chances that the person running the company doesn't have some sort of advanced degree is very, very small these days. Notice I said these days. Chances are that person will have an MBA. I have met scores of C-suite folks in these startups in the hotspots of this country and find it ridiculously rare for anyone to not have an MBA or equivalent experience leading a company that has acquired investment. That only exists in the tech industry, and even the founders are generally replaced by more experienced personnel. This notion of being against advanced degrees is ridiculous and not supported by any data whatsoever. Everyone always hones in on the ""success"" stories of entrepreneurs who were able to do it, but what folks fail to realize is those stories are a tiny fraction of the entrepreneurs who are able to lead a company through it's development. Long story short..if an entrepreneur is looking for serious capital in a non-tech related industry they will need to have an MBA (or advanced degree) and/or years of experience in the industry before any investor will take them seriously. If they don't then the investors will request that they do bring on someone who does per the terms of the agreement."
