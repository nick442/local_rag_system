On a company level ROCE over WACC would be more meaningful in my view but the end result should be be pretty much the same. This concept is closely related to value creation. Value can only be created when a company's ROCE is exceeding its cost of funding - WACC. This is also tightly related with the NPV concept. Value is only created when the NPV on a project is >0. And to directly answer OP. Study in detail WACC. (weighted average cost of capital). Focus on the Modiglianiâ€“Miller theorem with taxes and financial distress costs. Good luck.
