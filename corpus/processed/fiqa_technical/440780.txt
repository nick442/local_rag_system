Your description works except for HBO. HBO isn't included in any bundling because they don't have any advertising. Their only source of revenue is consumers paying them for their content either through subscriptions. Thats why you've seen HBO be very aggressive in DVD publishing and online offerings compared to other channels. I think that in their heart of hearts, HBO's management would very much like to sell directly to the consumer through some sort of digital market place and cut out the cable middle man. Unfortunatly most of their revenue still comes from cable subscriptions, and they can't risk pissing off their business partners by going directly to consumers.
