it depends on the area you want to focus in. to be sure, i will say that pretty much all certificates in finance can be achieved online now. CFP is a pretty ok one. i have it myself. there is quite a bit of material, but isn't too challenging. it focuses on financial planning/personal finance. certainly aids your technical knowledge but is kind of an analog to help boost your sales. most pure planners i know have this but moreover a series of more technical designations. you must have a bachelors to be given the right to use the CFP. CFA is a great one for your resume (and knowledge), but makes the CFP look like a summer vacation. it is for analysis, but has a broad range of potential uses. i know brokers, advisors, planners, and people leaders with these marks. if you are very smart, it will take you a minimum of 2.5 years (really 3yr) to complete due to their testing schedule. they also grade on a very steep curve. from what i understand, the amount of information and level of command you must demonstrate also necessitate this lengthy schedule. beyond that, you can look at getting FINRA licensed in a desired area (e.g. series 7/63 to be a broker). i would caution against this, unless you are very sure of where you want to go or need to meet the requirement for a job. typically jobs with license requirements will permit you 3-6 months to obtain them on company money. you risk spending a good bit of money that won't be reimbursed by getting licensed independently. keep in mind that you cannot actually use your licenses without a firm sponsor. finally, there are a variety of specialized designations like CWS and CMT that i would also caution against unless sure of desired position or meeting job requirements. it is better, in my opinion, to find yourself in a place where getting these will better position you for your current job rather than wasting time on them and finding yourself in a place where they hold no water.
