">drive around in a dangerous fucking forklift You sound like an idiot who has never been anywhere near a ""fucking forklift"". Forklifts are responsible for 85 deaths per year, which is less than the number of deaths by [sunbeds](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-198104/Sunbeds-blamed-100-deaths-year.html), [icicles](http://www.oddee.com/item_98002.aspx), or [pen caps](http://www.omg-facts.com/Other/Pen-caps-cause-100-deaths-a-year/51065?id=51065&c_val=3). Don't even start with the number of deaths caused per year by extension cords. Who knows what terrible, dangerous, and subversive acts they take part in during the day. I bet they even speak to one another with positive words during working hours! You are either a terrible troll or very ignorant. Either way, stop. Just stop."
