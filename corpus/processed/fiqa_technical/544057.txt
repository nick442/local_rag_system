It's not something for nothing. Tiger woods made billion dollars. He gave half to his wife. 500m sitting making money in investments. His only skill is swinging a stick at a ball and hitting it exactly where it needs to be. Now he is making 50m a year off his investments. Not sure if you noticed, America has a 600b deficit. That taxation creates federal jobs. And jobs employed by payments of the federal government. Good hard working people.
