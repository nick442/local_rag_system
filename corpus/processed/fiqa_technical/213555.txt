"So, did anyone else bother to actually look up the balance sheet? I just pulled it up [here](http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/nflx/financials?query=balance-sheet&data=quarterly). It looks like as of June 30, 2017, Netflix total liabilities were $13.4 billion. Current liabilities are about $5b and the other ~$8.4 are long term liabilities. That alone makes the ""article"" questionable because I don't know where exactly they got their bogus numbers from. At any rate, total liabilities don't really matter, as long as they have the cash flow to pay for it, and investors are happy with their total return on equity. This is a low quality shitpost by someone paid by the word at LA Times."
