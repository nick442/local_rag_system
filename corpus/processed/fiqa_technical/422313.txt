Fungible means that any gold is as good as any other gold. It has nothing to do with being able to form, shape, combine or divide it. If I borrow an ounce of gold from you, you want an ounce of gold returned. You don't care which chunk of gold I bring you as long as it's the same weight and purity. If I owe you a dollar, you don't care which specific dollar bill I hand you.
