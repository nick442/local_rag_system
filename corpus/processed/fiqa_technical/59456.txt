The FDA exists to check on the meat industry, if some gumshoe journalists claim there's something wrong with the way meat is procured, doesn't this implicate the FDA? I felt like this story came out of nowhere, possibly politically charged, and completely unfounded - especially if they're not also going after the FDA. The FDA should really protect these companies to a degree, you can't slam a company for complying with regulations! I really do hope this blows up in ABC's face. Going after the FDA would have been considered a much riskier move with far less attractive ($$$) headlines.
