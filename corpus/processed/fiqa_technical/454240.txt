Well then that kind of makes drug tests seem stupid then, right? I grew up in an area where oil money was big, heard handful of stories of people failing drug tests and being fired. Heard a few other rare stories of people working 20+ years in the oil industry who knew how to pass and smoked weed daily. But you seem pretty convinced this has worked well for you. So I guess its fair to ask then, do you believe this is the best we can do? What are your thoughts about medical conditions, should opiates be treated the same as weed? Do you know that theres different types of weed? I encourage you to keep learning, and you can start to understand why so many people might be defending this topic. The war on drugs is over, the facts are out and proven its an extreme waste and set back to humanity. Step back for a second, look more at the bigger picture, is this really the best we can do?
