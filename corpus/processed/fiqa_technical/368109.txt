I will take Obama with an unbroken job creator record despite a deliberate GOP NO policy in Congress over George Bush and Herbert Hoover's massive job destruction any time, any day, any minute. As for regulations - industry after industry have failed to self regulate effectively leaving state and federal government the onerous task. All it takes are a few companies in an industry to systematically break the rules for cost-cutting advantages relative to their competitors - and self regulation goes awry as in BP and Halliburton in the Gulf and all the small businesses hiring illegal immigrants and thus encouraging the illegal practice.
