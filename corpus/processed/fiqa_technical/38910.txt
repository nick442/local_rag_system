"Lol. I once had to listen to someone who tried to convince me that I could gain 6% a year, risk free by investing in the financial institution he represented, while pitching something pre formatted he obviously didn't understand. Because of that and the sort of ""cult vibe"" I got from them I never returned. But my bad, see, I could have been rich right now."
