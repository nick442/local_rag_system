A living wage is a great idea but asking business to pay for it is bad. It's not that companies can't afford it, it's that for every company that can afford it there are about a dozen small ones that can't (eg small businesses). The solution is to have a universal wage subsidy funded by the government and sourced through increased taxes (especially in the financial sector). This would allow companies to pay lowish wages while the government tops it up to ensure that low paid workers get more money.
