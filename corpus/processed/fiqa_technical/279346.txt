COBRA provides you the option to continue your coverage as you had during your employment, after you leave your job. It is optional, you need to actively elect it. Once you elect, coverage starts from the day your employment coverage ends. So to answer your questions: Yes, it is legal. You elected this yourself, no-one forced you. You cannot get your money back. You did have coverage in June-July-August, since your COBRA election provided coverage from the date you left your job. As to cancellation, from the DOL FAQ: Q12: Can continuation coverage be terminated early for any reason? A group health plan may terminate coverage earlier than the end of the maximum period for any of the following reasons: If continuation coverage is terminated early, the plan must provide the qualified beneficiary with an early termination notice. The notice must be given as soon as practicable after the decision is made, and it must describe the date coverage will terminate, the reason for termination, and any rights the qualified beneficiary may have under the plan or applicable law to elect alternative group or individual coverage. If you decide to terminate your COBRA coverage early, you generally won't be able to get a Marketplace plan outside of the open enrollment period. For more information on alternatives to COBRA coverage, see question 4 above.
