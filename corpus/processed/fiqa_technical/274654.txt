Pro tip (I'm a financial advisor): some people aren't lucky enough to have rich parents or relatives who will pay for their education. Those who aren't poor or wealthy are caught in the middle, unable to pay their way and unable to get enough grants to pay their way. Scholarships are never a given. Using debt to increase your intrinsic value is a wise investment.
