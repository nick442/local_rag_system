Wherever you park right now. It’s relatively simple to run electric lines and install chargers. I’m doing that to my house right now. Well, not installing a charger yet, but the box and everything is right by where I park. We’re upgrading the electrical system and it’ll be ready for it. I have gasoline cars now and am eager to go electric. I’m putting a few thousand into my daily driver so it’ll be good for another 8-10 years. I think electric cars will hit their stride somewhere around 2025. I’m going solar before next summer and will put away a few thousand a year towards an electric car. Better than car payments on something that will be obsolete soon.
