Well I just had my interview about 2 weeks ago and some of these questions DID come up. So these are a start, but also you should just pay attention carefully to your finance course literature. Things like price/yield relations of bonds. How does maturity affect their price sensitivity? What does dividend issuance do to the value of an equity's stock? As to your next summer internship.. I find it a little weird that you'd be involved in VC. No offense, but those people usually have many years of background in an industry before they start giving seed money to prospective companies. Maybe some specifics on what you'd actually be doing for a VC firm could help me help you.
