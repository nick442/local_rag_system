Yes did this. Had 5 years management experience at a state level with industry specific qualifications (financial services). Interview with the dean, written request and I was in on the basis that after the first 4 terms they could either give me a graduate diploma and send me on my way OR let me finish the MBA. Now I have an MBA.
