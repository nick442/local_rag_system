"I still think this tech boom is different. The 2000 boom/bust was so much based around a fiction. Namely, the infrastructure and logistics. The country was not yet set up for streaming services or online retail, the main drivers of that boom/bust. Today, broadband is ubiquitous, there's a computer in every home, and a smartphone in every pocket. Big data and automation drives vastly more efficient logistics, with the only main obstacle still yet to be worked out is AI that will allow companies like Uber and Tesla to realize their valuations. And the main drivers of tech are the so-called FAANG stocks (Facebook, Alphabet, Amazon, Apple and Netflix), as well as other tech like Microsoft and Cisco. What's the difference between these and, say, Pets.com or HotBot? *These are real companies.* Pets.com went boom to bust in less than a year. Broadcast.com sold for $5+billion..in 1999 (u kidin me?) Today's ""overvalued"" stocks have product, customers, business models and strategies in place. And the infrastructure they depend on actually exists."
