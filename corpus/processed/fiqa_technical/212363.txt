You should think of Required Rate of Return in your own terms. Say a friend tells you that he will give you $ to stand in line and get him tickets to your schools football game. The line is on average two hours long and you DIDN'T plan on going to the game, so you are going out of your way for him. What is the minimum dollar value that you would charge him to stand in line for him? What price would make standing in line worth it?
