The unique, single-unit structure of MicroGrid provides many real advantages. First and foremost is its uniformity of electrical conductivity, which surpasses that of discreet metal fiber and wire cloth open materials. Woven wire cloth strands can unravel and contact resistance between the strands can vary. MicroGridâ€™s unitary solid foil structure offers uniform and better conductivity.
