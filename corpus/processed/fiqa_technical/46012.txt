Ammo prices are the result of our constant wars. There are only so many bullet manufacturers and they are running 24 hour shifts to meet military demand. When we stop expending so much of it over in the desert they will be able to shift production back to domestic markets and prices will fall a little. Doubt they will ever go back to what they were though.
