It depends what area of finance, but an ivy league education is not *required*. A good school, probably, but the best thing you can do for yourself is go through the internship program at a bank or financial institution (usually after junior year, but you find the occasional sophomore). There are often many job offers to those that complete it well, and if not, you apply to other firms with your internship as your backing. It would help to know what Gyroisabot asked and know what area and what school you went to.
