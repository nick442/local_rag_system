What? Our currency isn't backed by debt currently. It's a fiat currency. Now, if you're asking whether we could back the value of our currency against some type of debt, sure we could, but it would be an incredibly poor decision. The Constitution doesn't specify the type of currency the U.S. has. It gives Congress that power to either delegate that decision, as in the case of the Federal Reserve or pass their own laws.
