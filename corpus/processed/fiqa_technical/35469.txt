Supposedly it was partially a giant middle finger to the board of directors at Sears who had not allowed Eddie Lampert to make changes he wanted to make to Sears. He used his investment firm's assets to buy up a sizable chunk of K-Mart while Chairman of Sears, then had K-Mart and Sears merge, giving him a more controlling stake of the corporation. It seems he has not been able to deliver on the promise of revolutionizing the two stores to compete better in the modern economy though, as the two parts continue to struggle (as made obvious by these closures).
