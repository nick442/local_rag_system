"Not just executives, there's going to be giant finance, HR, etc functions for these chains. There's also a massive advertisement budget to pay for (remember, every time you see an ad for something, it's priced into that product). Finally, chains are frequently ""victims"" of leveraged buyouts/takeovers and thus have a metric fuckton of debt to pay off."
