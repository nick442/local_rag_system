sell drugs? (joking) In all seriousness though, your options to legally invest this money are limited, which leaves you to extra-legal options... which many young people engage, different kind of candy I guess. Ok so you cannot invest into stocks, to day trade. Because you're not an adult. You can put the money in a bank, but the interest rate on that amount of money is in the realm of ~0.1%. You can use the money to seed another legal business venture, say another kind of better candy. My advice is to get a parental unit to put the cash into a mutual fund, in your name.. then hand that over to you when you turn 18.
