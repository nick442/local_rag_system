Really, you should only use words you understand - particularly if you're going to throw _one single word_ into an argument and act as if that's all you need to say. If the price were perfectly elastic, then for every increase in cost in airline flights, people would spend exactly enough less on flights to counteract that. What you mean is that price _inelasticity_ will mitigate this. But in fact, since the elasticity of the market is almost certainly negative like almost all markets, the airlines will in fact lose some money for every such tax put on them; less money than the cost of the tax, yes, because of the inelasticity of the market, but some.
