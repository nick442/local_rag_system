"Ok. I get it. They actively cut expenses on their overhead and payroll. My focus is on their brand-x products. Last time I was there I bought their brand-x Fritos to try. No marking at all as to who produces them or where. My biggest fear is that they come from China or India where QC is, shall we say, lax. Or they use ingredients are ""farm animal"" quality. I can't imagine they are QC'ing the products on the factory floor of their vendors, assuming they care. It's all about the buck. And on a side note, it gripes me to no end that a company can go through the huge time/expense to bring a product to market (like Frito's) only to have it ripped off by Aldi type brand-x copycats. Truthfully, if it wasn't for my mother (a German) pushing me to take her there, I'd never step foot in Aldi. The place truly creeps me out."
