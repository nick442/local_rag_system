In the UK the free newspapers have a page dedicated to famous people getting drunk. I play a game where I see how long it takes before I find out why the person is famous. The latest realizations: Pixie Lott isn't Bob Geldorf's daughter. Duffy isn't Hillary Duff. Kim Kardashian wasn't a porn star - she just had a sex tape.. I haven't figured out why she's famous yet. Also, Lady GaGa has a song called 'born this way.' Anyway, the kinda point of the game is to figure out why I know which songs are by lady GaGa and which are by Amy winehouse if I hadn't clever knowingly heard there songs. And what does that mean for copyright vs. What must be in the public domain. E.g. if I have a song in my head which has been drilled into me, at what point can we consider it part of the fabric of our society. In otherwords, when does it become public domain as much as the 'performance ' of a car horn or a tree rustling?
