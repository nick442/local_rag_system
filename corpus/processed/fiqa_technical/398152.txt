"I have a BA in Economics from the University of North Texas and I think it's a wonderful degree. I paired it with a finance minor. As others have said, the BA degree has more theory and less quantitative skills, but I found the quant skills I learned in my BA (through multiple regression/time series) to be a great start for an entry level job out of college. I'll also say that while it's not a ""business"" degree, it has major implications in business. No, you won't know accounting, but the theory you learn in economics is applied in accounting, in operations, in finance, in marketing, etc. Honestly, if you're smart and you know how to apply what you learn in Econ, you can do whatever you want."
