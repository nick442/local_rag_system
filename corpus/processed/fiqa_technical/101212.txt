There are significant similarities, but also differences. The 1917 Revolution grew out of conditions near starvation. Also, soldiers (or sailors in that case) did not want to be canon fodder in an unnecessary war. We are nowhere near the point of revolution. And thankfully so. Revolutions are more fun to read about than to live through.
