"Paying in physical cash is almost never a good idea for large purchases (unless you like being audited and/or having lots of attention from law enforcement). All purchases over $10k in cash need to have special forms filled out for the IRS and Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, so this is not a tinfoil hat conspiracy theory.. if you do that on the regular, you ARE being investigated. When people say ""cash"" for normal purchases, they generally mean a wire transfer (e.g. buying a house ""cash"" = wire transfer between banks). In this case, purchasing a company ""cash"" is contrasted with purchasing with stock. So instead of getting $13.7B of AMZN, Amazon takes out a loan (or pulls their money from cash on on hand) and transfers it to the financial institution handling the sale. Everyone who owns WFM stock gets paid out in cash, as opposed to receiving some number of shares of AMZN."
