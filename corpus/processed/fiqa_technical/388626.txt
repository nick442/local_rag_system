This article makes sense. Reduce supply of labor, wages go up as employers compete for the remaining workers. This is simple economics. Whether this is a good thing, or not, is a matter of opinion and political persuasion. You could write various headlines based upon how you interpret the data (all are pretty much correct): * Immigrants kicked out and American blue collar wages rise (Hurray!) * Misguided immigration policy raises prices for everyone (Boo!) * Kicking out immigrants makes it harder to get construction done (Boo!) * Trump helps the working American earn more (Hurray!)
