You have three options. If you follow the procedures outlined by the IRA trustee there should not be any problems. There will not be any taxes involved, unless as part of the process you change non-Roth funds to Roth funds, or you don't follow the procedures. In my experience the IRA companies know how to handle the transfer. In some cases the check must be sent to you, and then you send it to the IRA company, but they will tell you exactly how the check is to be made out to. I would start by talking to the IRA trustee they are likely to have seen it all, and can guide you through the process.
