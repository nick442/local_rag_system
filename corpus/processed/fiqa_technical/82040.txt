You know, your attempt at dramatic fiction is beneath you. You are more than this, You were taught as a child to love your neighbor and now you are going against your own beliefs to support the increase in income of people who are so much more powerful than you are and really don't care about you at all except for your vote. Is that how you want to be remembered? You have your entire life ahead of you. I want you to enjoy every last moment of it, but keep your eyes open and look around and see all the possibilities in front of you besides hating other people.
