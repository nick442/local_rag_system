Not entirely practicle advise. What about healthcare and all those other essential needs? When it comes down to it if the economy is rockin and rollin like back in the mid-1990's people can easily jump boat to another company. But in todays more sluggish enviroment that option is not their for most workers. I think the honest fact is no good solutions are apparent. You give some ideas but if saving money was that easy for most people then .. well you know .. why would anyone complain, right?
