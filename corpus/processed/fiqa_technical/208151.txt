Will never be a Uber customer. I prefer my taxis to be a sustainable business, where drivers make an actual wage, which is above the minimum hourly rate for 17 year old kids. Currently the most efficient Uber driver can make around 10 cents per mile, in net income. Or less than $4 an hour, even if driving non-stop.
