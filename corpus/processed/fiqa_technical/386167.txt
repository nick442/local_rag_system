"I agree that the figure seems low. I think that 2 things are going on. Firstly, this was clearly not a ""offer he could not refuse"". Second, Lucas is getting a bit older and he knows how much work it takes to create a SW film. I think Lucas saw what they have done for Marvel and Pixar, and said this is the best landing spot for the SW franchise. These are the only guys with the resources to pull this off. Remember, he is now disney's 2nd largest stock holder. He was not just cashing out, if disney shits the bed on this one he takes the lose as well."
