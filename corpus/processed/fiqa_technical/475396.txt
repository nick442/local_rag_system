I'll have to read the discussion. I did mean owed. A quick reading of the decision seemed to indicate that the law they were considering was for 3rd party debt collection agencies. They decided that if the company was directly owed the money, they weren't under that law. If it was a unanimous decision it seems like there must have been something pretty obvious about it. Thanks for the link to the discussion.
