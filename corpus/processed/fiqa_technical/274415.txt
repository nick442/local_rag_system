The best thing you can do is get your CFA (assuming it applies to the job that you want) Get your series testing done - this is a a lot easier and cheaper than CFA but isn't that amazing. You also have to be sponsored. Join a club and get on the executive board. Try investing your own money so you can get a better feel for the market. If you don't have any money then try a simulated game. I personally use marketwatch.com and compete with others that way. This is all in addition to the obvious ones: Go to a good school, get good grades (especially in your finance classes) have a good resume, learn how to interview, and have as much work experience as possible. INTERNSHIPS are your best friend.
