The mechanisms are also heavily influenced by sociopaths who are enamored with the power that comes with wealth. Sadly those who have gained tremendous wealth and prosperity and want to give back by providing opportunity for others less fortunate are very much in the minority. Others are just selfish douchebags that believe in the commoditization of things like health care, for example, when they, themselves, benefit from having the best health care afforded to them under different terms. On another note, it's difficult to regulate free enterprise. Despite my observations in the preceding paragraph, I actually appreciate both sides of this issue. If you've earned your money through your own blood, sweat, and tears, who am I to tell you what to do with your money? With that said, there are no simple answers. I go back to those whose greed and selfish personas that are the real issue. Capitalism isn't without its flaws. But when you combine it with d-bag motivation, you create a monopoly on wealth supported by d-bag policies and practices: golden parachutes, imbalanced compensation models, corporate money in politics, and many other things that are explicitly designed to preserve the wealth for the wealthy. In conclusion, this really isn't about an economic model as it is about the motivations of sociopathic d-bags who can't be bothered to think of anyone but themselves. These people give a bad name to others who are wealthy and get unfairly lopped into the stereotypes that are most commonly associated with those of great wealth and prosperity.
