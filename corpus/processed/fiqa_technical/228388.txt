it depends on what kind of IT you did, and where you took your econ courses afterward. did you do any coding? do any business cases studies? Can you calculate the book value of a firm from its balance sheet and assess the net present value of its cash flow? What happens to the value of a $1000 10 year bond at 4% when the current market rate drops to 3% 6 months after it was purchased? Do you know what kind of corporate valuation doesn't appear in a financial statement? If you can answer 1/2 of these questions, you will probably do just fine, but you will need to find someone to hire you and you will have to advance or find a new job every so often when you get bored again. another idea is to get an MBA in finance where you are, then jump into the finance arena.
