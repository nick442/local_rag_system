">he's confusing money with credit. Money is accumulated work, not debt. It's not accumulated **work**, because work has no intrinsic value. Money is a placeholder for **product**. Money is a token used to distribute fractional shares of product, just like an IOU, before the product is completed and tradable. In the case of our currency now, the risk of specific IOU-based money becoming worthless is avoided by making it a true fiat currency. It is still, however, effectively a placeholder for **debt**. The debt is simply collective, distributed, and easily divided into arbitrary amounts to pay for goods and services. If I have worked for my employer for a week building widgets and he has given me $100, the he has a bunch of widgets and I have a piece of paper with ""$100"" printed on it. That piece of paper has little intrinsic value. It is a placeholder for a partial share of the debt owed the company for giving people widgets, which they accumulated by creating fudgits where they work, and it continues backwards all the way to the Federal Reserve which says to the banks ""I will give you $10billion if you promise to repay it later with interest"". You know what prime rate lending is, right? **There's the debt upon which the whole system is built**."
