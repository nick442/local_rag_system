Do you all think this is a move where Amazon is looking to be collocated to another tech/business talent hub in a city on the opposite coast in order to attain a wider spread of talent? If so, would that probably be someplace like Boston? Or is this a move to get a cheaper but still talented professional workers in a city where they will not have to pay as much? I feel like that could be a lot of places. If this was a major set of logistics hubs, I would be looking at this differently, but it seems to be focused on professional workers right?
