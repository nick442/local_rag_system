And that's exactly why I took a coding bootcamp last winter and now am coding at a major corporation. I am working hard and improving my skillset. Others are not and may get there job automated - it is not my responsibility to support them because they didn't adapt. I never once blamed immigrants for anything - I encourage it as it increases productivity for the country. I just think our laws should be followed and it's not moral to skip the line and commit crimes. We must use LOGIC and Freedom not PC emotion when Governing our country.
