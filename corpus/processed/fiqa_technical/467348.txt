Trawling through the comments here it seems that almost every one has missed the point that the Tesla 3 is a performance car in addition to being electric. Sure it's not as fast as the 'S' but at 0-60 in 5.6 seconds that equals the Ford Mustang V6. In addition to that it also has fabulous handling. The [Motor Trend reviewer](http://www.motortrend.com/cars/tesla/model-3/2018/exclusive-tesla-model-3-first-drive-review/) called it the best small sedan he had ever driven. So to those niggling about displays and electricity costs per mile and colored paint costs $1000 more this is kind of like looking at a Porsche Boxster and complaining about the back seat and the trunk space. All true but also almost entirely irrelevant.
