Or you know maybe the EU could have stayed out of the Ukraine in the first place. Trying to draw the Ukraine into the EU is the equivalent of China getting Canada to agree to lease a few military bases on Canadian soil to them. There is absolutely no chance in hell the U.S. will sit by and let that happen without serious consequences. Perhaps Western Europe should take responsibility for the shit they started in the first place when they proposed that trade pact with the Ukraine. Because now any free country in Eastern Europe that is anywhere close to Russia is worried about paying the consequences and running to the only major power that looks like it actually gives a shit about standing up to the Russians. After 10 years in Iraq and Afghanistan Americans really don't want to get into another shooting war. We have enough on our hands keeping China at bay. It's the EU that grossly under estimated the Russian response and can't get its shit together without U.S. help to form a coherent strategy to counteract Russian aggression. There is a lot of injustice and conflict in this world that you can blame us Americans for. But this shit in the Ukraine is not one of them.
