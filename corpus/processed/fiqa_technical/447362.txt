Not to my knowledge. That would still make me responsible for maintaining separate accounts w/ each website that I regularly used - while the ideal method of billing for content would be automatic and backgrounded with only a single point of contact. Sort of like how you don't pay for separate channels w/ cable subscriptions, you pay the cable network and they sort out the pricing for the various channels based on viewership stats.
