Some good honest questions..there will be people who come in here and claim one side or the other but the answer is, yes. It's a little bit of all those things. Some of those things actually tug on each other..as one becomese a problem the other worsens as well..so Y is bad but is it because of X? For example, overly simlified, if people can't get a loan for a new home would this effect the number of new homes being built? If home builders can't sell homes at a certain price because banks aren't willing to lend X dollars to someone with Y credit worthiness, they drop their prices to Y credit worthiniess, which effects used homes sales which means more people are still under water for their current home value and chose not to sell their used home which leads to less inventory as well. There's a million scenarios. A million answes. None of which I have.
