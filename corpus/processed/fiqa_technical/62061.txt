"I do find it interesting how live sports are the glaring exception to people not watching live TV. The reason for this is obvious, you want to watch the local team/the big game as it happens so it isn't spoiled and so on, and it probably helps explain why the NFL and other leagues, and a network like ESPN can thrive. Of course they might still move away from live tv broadcast anyway thanks to things like watch.espn and all the leagues having their own ""online"" networks now."
