"Hmm.. Maybe I somewhat misunderstood your question then. Yes, trade deficits/surpluses are really the core of the country-level ""investment"". But yes, it maters what they *do* with it, which is **why** so many countries put any excesses into US treasuries. Going back to ""personal"" finance, if they pay down higher interest debt with their trade surplus, *great*; if they have no debt and can issue local currency (in PF land, ""take out a loan"") for under 2%, *great*; If not.. **Not** so great. ""Saving"" money that costs over 2% isn't an investment, it's nothing but a loan disguised as one."
