"That's what stood out to me. The headlines make it sound like we're all financially stupid for not going with solar. The question is what is the *retail* price of solar vs other sources. Don't get me wrong; the idea of it going down quickly is itself great. But the title says ""cheapest electricity ‘ever, anywhere, by any technology’"". Show me the retail bills for solar as being cheaper than other sources and we've got a winner. That phenomenon is the real inflection point of interest."
