"Smartphones? Really? How about a lack of work and a scarcity of disposable income? Currently the US unemployment rate is at 4.2%, below the mark for ""full employment"" and *well* below where upwards wage pressure should be forming. At the same time, the participation rate is also moribund, dithering around the 60% mark. At this point, there should be so much wage pressure that an argument over minimum wage should be moot, as even the corner McD's should be offering $15 an hour just to get people to notice the help wanted sign, and yet it isn't happening. Why? Because there are no jobs. ""But the BLS says there are 6.2 million jobs available!"" you say. Yes, and they've said so since July. This is called churn, and it's the same jobs being offered over and over again to people who stay for a month and move on. The low inflation is due to one thing: Normal, everyday people have no money to spend, there is no real economic growth, there is no wage pressure. All the money is locked up in financial markets, making more wealth, but producing nothing. ""But look at all the smartphones that exist today"" that replaced flip phones that replaced wall phones. Sure, everything is cheaper: It has to be, or else no one could afford it."
