They are flame broiled, then put on a bun and places in a steam warmer, they are pretty warm when they come out (helps to soften the buns a bit too). There are only a few things they microwave before sending out usually. Its been awhile (over 15 years) since I worked there, but I am sure the process is pretty much the same.
