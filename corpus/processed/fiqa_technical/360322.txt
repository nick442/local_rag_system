If you want a career that gets you lots of money and you want to advance, you are going to be working more than 40 hours per week. I am at a 45 hour a week job, and its nice to have time off at home and all that, but I don't make enough money to really do too much in my free time. I'm looking for a new job currently, Its tough, because this is what you spend the majority of your week doing, and no one wants to be miserable doing it.
