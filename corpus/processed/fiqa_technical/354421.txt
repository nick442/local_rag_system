"> in a market, you can only gain a ""monopoly"" by giving the customers the most value You get a monopoly by destroying your competition. Microsoft is a good example of how a company with market dominance can squeeze out competition. This isn't some old-timey problem that's fed to us in some grand conspiracy by the public schools. If I choose not to buy from Comcast, how does that give me power over them? They're the only player in town, so everyone else pays them regardless of what I do. I think you're just disappointed in the people who are elected. But individuals have much more power over elected officials than they do corporations."
