If I was bank, I certainly wouldn't give a **30 year** mortgage to a **57 year old** with a property which is worth less than the mortgage! And I don't see why a bank should. I get that it sucks for him to have a 6.35% interest mortgage, but that situation sucks for the bank as well. I wouldn't offer a lower interest to someone in that sort of situation.
