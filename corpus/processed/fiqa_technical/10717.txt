I can't believe he disrespected exit strategies. Exit strategies are the most important part of starting a business in my opinion- being to get out of a business with your life still in tact is crucial. I have started 6 businesses and have successfully exited 4 of them. I know friends and family who started businesses with no exit plan and are now grinding away their lives unhappily, feeling trapped in a business that isn't worth being involved in anymore. A lot of times things don't go as planned in business, and a clean exit is a way to move forward with life with your chin up.
