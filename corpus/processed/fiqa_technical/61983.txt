"Well sounds like Disney is gonna have less people watching their movies, lol How many people who have Netflix are going to go ""Oh yeah definitely I'm going to pay for yet *another* streaming service!"" vs how many people are they going to pick up who don't already subscribe to netflix (hint not many). So Disney is not going to gain *new* viewers, they are just going to attempt to take them from netflix, but with *only* a few hundred movies, good luck keeping them subscribed."
