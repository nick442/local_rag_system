You can use a used paint brush to scrub the frame and loosen the dust and the same technique can also be implemented on uPVC Windows and windows as well. The dust, dirt, cobwebs, etc., can be further removed using a vacuum cleaner. You should totally avoid abrasive sponges and clothes along with harsh creams and cleaning solutions, as they might cause permanent damage to uPVC windows as well as awning windows Melbourne.
