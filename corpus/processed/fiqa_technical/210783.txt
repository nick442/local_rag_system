Did you even read the article or just scroll through the headline? “Affordable” is relative to subsidies. For example, my wife and I earn about 100k a year combine and we do not receive subsidies because *gasp* we can afford health care at that income. This is also based on a percentage of income that the ACA defines as affordable. Whether it actually is affordable or not is relative. Is dumping a percentage of your income into the governments discretionary and travel budget so they can fly private jets affordable? Someone deemed it was when they set the budget (though of course its grossly negligent). Not to mention insurers (like ehealth.com) can game the system by adjusting rates. It’s kind of amazing how quickly people on the Internet jump to make an issue a partisan pissing match so they can feel “right” rather than considering solutions.
