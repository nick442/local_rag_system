Comparing Buzzfee to Tesla is completely ridiculous, but your comparison is just as ludicrous. Tesla's one of the best companies to emerge in the last decade. They're the best selling car in their class. They made the highest awarded car in every single category for their model year ON THEIR FIRST TRY. It's like someone compared George W. Bush to George Washington, and then you went on to call them stupid because George Washington wasn't actually a good president. You completely missed the irrationality of this comparison and then threw out something even more irrational.
