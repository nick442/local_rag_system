If you are referring to college tuition forgiveness, it is not stealing. College shouldn't cost so much in the first place, just look at most developed countries. My god you hyper capitalists are so brainwashed thinking the system you were raised in is the best there is when it reality it is horribly unfair and detrimental to countless lives. It is sickening how someone like you wants to see others suffer because you place yourself above them since you see yourself as being more responsible. Since you paid your loans, no one else's should be forgiven. But your stance would do a 180 if you just graduated school and after countless applications and interviews the only job you are able to get with your degree barely covers your living expenses, let alone loan costs. In that scenario loan forgiveness might sound more appealing.
