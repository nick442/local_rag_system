"The difference between me and Uncle Sam is that Uncle Sam gets the lowest interest rates in the world. If I could borrow money at 1.7% for 10 years you bet your ass I'd do it! Also, the notion that ""Uncle Sam is running out of people to borrow from, and is having trouble paying those loans back (and the interest)"" is just false. US treasuries are the most sought after debt in the world. If anyone had any doubt uncle sam would pay them back, interest rates would be skyrocketing, not at historic lows. After that quote I turned it off, about two minutes in. This is just more FUD designed to get you to buy gold or whatever. Ignore it."
