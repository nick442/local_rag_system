The choices given are either leave after some reasonable hours or put in endless crunch time until you drop dead. The reality, as usual, is between those extremes. Most people are hired to get a job done. That is likely to require some extra work, and if you really care about the job then that isn't really so bad and is not going to scale up to suicidal levels. Crunch time as such is increasingly rare because the downsides are so glaringly obvious. It generates inferior work and burns out critical assets. At the same time there is no reason to believe that significant professional challenges will necessarily fit neatly into standardized work time arrangements. Sometimes difficult problems come up and need to be handled or innovative products won't be released in time to make a difference in the marketplace.
