"Which people? There are 7 billion people in the world. The majority of them are relatively poor; and the reasons why they either remain so, or are able (and willing) to change their status.. the reasons vary tremendously. Alas, I think the author missed the point of the statement the woman made, he began with a *belief* ""..the poor at all times and enclose them, making up a “surround of force” from which, it seems, they cannot escape. I had come to understand that this was what kept the poor from being political and that the absence of politics in their lives was what kept them poor."" and he really never looked outside of the context of his own biased view. The key in is hidden in the middle of his statements of belief above -- the ""it SEEMS, they cannot escape"". That is what the woman was addressing, the ""it seems"" and ""escape"". In fact many DO ""escape"" (historically speaking, most of the US population are descendents of such ""escapees""). When the things ""surrounding them"" are massive, then it takes a lot of courage, AND humility, AND willingness to sacrifice & risk -- to leave those surroundings and venture out into the ""great unknown"" (potentially having to endure a lot of hardship, and possibly failing, when there). So the biggest hurdle they have to overcome is an identical ""belief"" that the author had at the beginning (and seems to have still maintained). It isn't about ""politics"" (at least not in the modern sense of the word)."
