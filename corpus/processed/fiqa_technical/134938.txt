Not really on the corporate finance side, so excuse me if my explanation seems a bit verbose. Nobody *wants* to give away control of their company, but investors are going to demand a pretty steep discount on your equity if you don't give them some way to steer management. Control is valuable, and to this extent, voting shares should always be worth *at least* as much as non-voting shares. If the owner still retains 51% of the company, however, then the voting shares provide essentially no benefit over non-voting, barring the founder's sudden divestiture. With this in mind, there's basically no reason to issue voting shares in the first place. On the other hand, with 40% of the voting power the founder's still have a key vote and will rarely be overturned unless a supermajority (84%) of the other investors disagree. This still gives them *de facto* control while offering equity holders some degree of security if the founders were ever to suddenly lose their mind. This added security allows the voting shares to trade at a premium over non-voting, which in turn allows the company to raise more money from their equity issuance.
