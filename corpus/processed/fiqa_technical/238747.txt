If you are using T-mobile you don't have to put $100 in each year to keep your minutes for a year. Once you spend $100 you get a year with any additional minutes you buy. Buying them $100 at a time is the cheapest way - but when you renew you can renew with only $50 or $30 and you have a year to use them from the last time you bought. I did this this year - only put $50 on each phone because we don't use $100 worth in a year.
