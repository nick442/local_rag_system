Just tried to buy lunch with some gold dust. They said they only take US dollars. Gold is really no different than fiat paper/digital or even cryptocurrencies. Outside of the industrial uses for it, of which there are many but not so many that it would use up all the gold that's been mined shy of just using up all the gold that's been mined to use up all the gold that's been mined, its value is also based on perception and perceived value. .no different than anything else someone wants and is willing to do x in order to get it. When push comes to shove, other things contain way more value than gold, and gold is just *a* medium with which to exchange those things for. But, again, only because people agree for it *to* be a medium they're willing to accept. Again, you can't eat, drink, fuck, shelter, etc yourself with gold, you can only get food, drink, sex with it. .if the other party is willing to accept it which, today, wasn't the case. https://www.coindesk.com/gold-investor-john-hathaway-cryptocurrencies-garbage/
