"That sucks, I liked his first and second books (the only ones I've read). I was still in my late teens, and RDPD was the first personal improvement (or personal financial improvement if you must) book I've ever read. It really got me hooked on the whole personal improvement thing, and on fixing my then-abysmal financial situation. It had a ton of good advice, and I still use it to this day. It's a very good primer book, to help you let go of the worker bee mentality, and pick up the businessman mentality. To anyone who wants to start a business and has no prior experience with ""making money,"" it's still the first book I would recommend. It's extremely easy to read, and most of the advice is solid. The guy (forgot his name, he has an entire site about it) who goes around criticizing Kiyosaki on his ""bad advice"" is actually dead wrong on a lot of his points. Not all, but enough to make me not take him seriously. Not ALL the advice in the book is perfect, mind you, but most of it is very good, and hence the book is a good one overall. You can read it in a day or two (or even an evening), and it really gets you hooked on making money - you can then channel that enthusiasm into harder, longer and more detailed books. Worked for me."
