Well first of all, they clawed back 75 mln of those bonuses paid out, so they really didn't get paid that money. Second, not every executive, not even probably more than one executive, was even aware this was happening. There is one who **might** have known it was happening, but the reality is that a lot of these decisions and plans are implemented several levels down from the executive team. The executives do not get involved in day to day shit typically. Third, those bonuses to executives are paid out in stock options. Stock options glean their value from the price of the stock. If the stock price goes down, then their bonuses lose value or become worthless, essentially meaning that they get reductions in pay or no bonus when the stock price goes down. So if the scandal had no affect on the stock price, why wouldn't they get paid their bonuses? The stock is the best indicator of the public's reaction to the entirety of the bank.
