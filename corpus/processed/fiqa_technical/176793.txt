It's already happening. Cryptocurrencies are your friend in this case. The other day I was on a torrent website which replaced ads with Monero based Captcha. I believe the website was using my CPU power to mine small amount Monero for themselves. If this is true, you won't need ads. Revenue will come straight from mining cryptos using the consumer's CPU.
