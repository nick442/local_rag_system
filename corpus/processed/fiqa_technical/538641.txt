My district wasn't a rich district. There were plenty of cheap houses, and I can't even think of a rich housing area in my district. Besides, I was offering a different solutions from moving to an entirely new country. I'm pretty sure if you can afford to move to a new country, you can afford to move to a different district. Also, you may disagree with this, but it is the parents that determine how well their kids do in school. As long as the child isn't fearing for his life, isn't worrying about going hungry, the teachers are doing the bare minimum, and the parents are involved in their kids school life, then the kid will do just fine in school.
