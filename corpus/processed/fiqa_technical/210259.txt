If the employees keep it up, then it would make sense for Walmart to raise their wages because they would not be able to find employees without raising the wage. If Walmart is always able to find employees who will work at minimum wage, though, it can be argued that the minimum wage is what that job is worth both to the employees (otherwise no one would take the job) and employers. Of course, this does not necessarily mean it is completely compassionate to do so since it is always nice to give people more money, it does show that this is efficient (using the economics sense of the word).
