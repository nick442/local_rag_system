"Agreed, and the problem is the product. I have Sony Reader, and I love the device itself, but the Adobe DRM that most (all?) non-amazon ebookstores use is locked to Adobe's eBook software ""Reader"" (not to be confused with Adobe Reader) is really buggy and completely vanilla in terms of features. It's so bad that I use Calibre whenever I can, and Calibre isn't exactly intuitive software, but at least it has some functionality in terms of converting formats and organizing my library."
