I wouldn't say fair enough. Go back and read the article again, right now, to remind yourself how bad it really was. Passion is okay but that article needs a lot of work to be taken seriously by anyone other than those who already circle jerk to bitcoin. If all he wants is hits and praise ($) from bitcoin fanatics, and doesn't care about the cause, then more power to him. If he wants to make a difference he needs a better writing style.
