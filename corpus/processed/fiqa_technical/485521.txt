You should've been job searching/networking instead of studying for that dumbass CFA. If you find out you failed, you COMPLETELY wasted your time. If you pass, you now have a CFA L1 or whatever with no experience. If you went to a well known school and can't find ANYTHING you clearly aren't trying hard enough. Make a LinkedIn and lurk the hell out of the alumni groups. Offer to intern for free. You need SOMETHING to cover the white space on your resume
