No, but it's not crazy out of reach of the salaries you listed, either. Heck, you even made a provision for $250k. And it's certainly over the $100k threshold. But sure, if all you are is a worker bee you're not going to make that. As long as you're quoting developer salaries, you're not going to make that. The question is where you go after being a developer, if you ever move past that. And yeah, there's a big difference in the number of people that make 100 vs 300.
