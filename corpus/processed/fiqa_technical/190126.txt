"> don't think Hillary would've delivered the same results (or Bernie,.. First, absolutely not under Bernie. Just his nomination or him being the president would kill the economy. As for Hillary, I did not vote for her, neither most American, not because she would do bad with the economy (but Trump would do better than her, for sure.) Just one example about Hillary: she cheated on debate questions that she got from fake-news CNN. If my son cheated on a test like that, he would be expelled from school. No other would-be president did such a s thing or even consider to do such a thing. Meanwhile, Trump, not even a politician, handled the debate questions very very well. So you want me to vote for Hillary who has zero morals, zero accomplishments in the past (she's just a ""wife of..""), mishandle top secret e-mail(s), rigging DNC elections against Bernie, etc? FYI, I am a democrat and I voted for Obama twice, Al Gore (idiot!) and Kerry (bigger idiot). I prefer to vote for a democrat, but not when the DNC and the Candidate is corrupt to the core, evil, killers, cheaters, etc. And you also believe anything from CNN after they cheat with Hillary on debate questions? So you wrote, and I wrote back: >>>How can it be fake news when we're looking at government generated economic data? >> Because government economic data shows the economy improved under Trump! > So yes, it's doing better than a year ago. You see? First you claim, based on fake news, that economy under Trump is not doing good, and then, quickly, the story changes."
