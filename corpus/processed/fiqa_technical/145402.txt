You sound like a shitty employee who has no idea he's a shitty employee. Unplug the extension cord, and don't let your crew members drive around in a dangerous fucking forklift without their seat belt. No wonder your boss is mental. I can't even imagine all the other stupid shit you do all day that your boss has to remind you not to do, and you just chalk it up to having a dick for a boss.
