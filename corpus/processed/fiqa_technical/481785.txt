"I don't see how employing more middle class workers would accelerate, say, the microprocessor research leading to better phones. I also don't see how we are at a point in resource distribution that only the rich can afford things. As far as I can tell, poor people have a tremendous amount of wealth compared to the poor of 500 years ago or even 100 years ago. What would a ""stronger economy"" do? Use more fuel? Produce more knicknacks for consumers to waste money on? You're missing the entire point."
