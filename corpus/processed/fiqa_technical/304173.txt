"It can be a great addition to another degree. STEM are a good choice. I paired mine with German, then went back years later for my MBA in Finance. As for whether it would go with information science, it all depends what you want to do. Those combine very well for some very specific roles these days. Though I would think as ""big data"" evolves, econ and IS could pair very well. My main concern is.. Have a desired outcome. It may never end up just like that, but you want to know what you're getting has a purpose in your endeavors. Do not get a STEM kicker just to have a STEM kicker."
