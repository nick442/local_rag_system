There's really no general rule of thumb. There are a lot of factors that go into that decision. It highly depends on the type of business, your financials and business strategy. It's a double edged sword because retained earnings lose the potential to provide a higher return. While being cash poor can easily kill a company. It sounds like you're experiencing significant growth. If there is high market potential and expansion prospects, a safe bet is to keep about 3 months of operating costs accessible while leveraging a bank loan to fund the growth. That's the best answer I can provide without having any information.
