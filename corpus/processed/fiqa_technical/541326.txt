Here is a bit more on this: * /r/changelog: [Domains can be blocked from being submitted](http://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/umx99/reddit_change_domains_can_be_blocked_from_being/). * /r/BannedDomains: [Reddit is now banning entire high-quality domains, using an unpublished list](http://www.reddit.com/r/BannedDomains/comments/v08ho/reddit_is_now_banning_entire_highquality_domains/). In part this appears to be reaction to editors at these publications spamming links to their publications and manipulating the upvotes, like [this guy at The Atlantic](http://www.dailydot.com/society/atlantic-slaterhearst-jared-keller-reddit/). It does seem a bit much, especially considering that there were some interesting articles at The Atlantic and Business Week that I wouldn't mind seeing on Reddit, so I hope that this is only a temporary fix while a more permanent solution is being worked on.
