Just looking at CONED, [here is gas](https://www.coned.com/_external/cerates/documents/average_monthly_gas_bills.pdf) and [here is electric](https://www.coned.com/-/media/files/coned/documents/accountandbilling/about-your-bill-rates/average_monthly_electric_bills.pdf). You'll have to forgive me -- when it comes to NY, I'm more familiar with gas and with residential rates, so what I said doesn't hold true across the board for electric commercial customers. For residential electric, starting in 2009, delivery started outpacing commodity charges; by 2015 (not sure why they haven't posted 2016 data yet), $29 worth of electricity cost you $49 in delivery charges. For residential gas, the flip occurred in 2010 and was much more significant -- in 2016, a customer whose bill is just over $100 paid $75 for delivery and $25 for the actual gas (part of that is that gas prices are low, part of it is that delivery costs have gone up nearly 50%). Each utility is different, so the [gas info is here](http://www3.dps.ny.gov/W/PSCWeb.nsf/All/85297E80413DBEDB852581A6006261BE?OpenDocument) and the [electric info is here](http://www3.dps.ny.gov/W/PSCWeb.nsf/ArticlesByTitle/0B9E6D4CE48E09EE852578570055E27B?OpenDocument) if you're interested. I'm not sure about primers -- I haven't really looked for them -- but I know that many companies and brokers do have some materials on their websites. For electricity in particular, I'm much more familiar with Texas than New York, but a lot of the principles are the same: look at your bills and make sure you understand all the charges and what your usage/demand is (especially over the course of a year), look up the [utility tariff](http://www3.dps.ny.gov/W/PSCWeb.nsf/ArticlesByTitle/1ABA5E2E4E08F72585257687006F3AB1?OpenDocument), and make sure everything lines up. I harp on demand charges (a charge based on your peak energy usage during any set interval of time -- 15 minutes in TX, not sure about NY) because that's where commercial customers can get stuck paying really high charges.
