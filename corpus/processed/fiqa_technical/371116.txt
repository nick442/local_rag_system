The increase in production is a prerequisite to be able to hit the price Tesla wants for the Model 3. 100,000 cars should result in a significant gain in economies of scale. I have no idea how many Model 3s will be produced, but 150-250,000 cars will allow Tesla to negotiate better prices with their supplies.
