There's someone on both sides of every derivatives trade. When volatility goes up, risk goes up, and prices go up. For every dollar lost when that price changes quickly, someone is making a dollar just as quickly. If you're on the right side, you can make a fortune overnight in derivatives when volatility is high; during a normal market, it is much harder and takes much longer.
