This isn't a very persuasive argument. Their revenue and profit is based on advertisers paying them for exposure. If the advertisers don't see actual business value from their Twitter ad buys, they won't buy more in the future. Twitter's been around for over a decade now, if advertisers are still spending $575M/quarter buying ads, they must be seeing some sort of return on that investment.
