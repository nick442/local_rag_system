"Your statement - ""not practical"" - presumes that the primary goal of having the store is to allow the store to thrive. But if you subscribe to the idea that stores and other companies are just organizations of people, that presumption is false we humans form social structures that benefit people who live within the social structures - towns, cities, teams, companies, political parties. the success of ""the store"" or the company or the team, or the ""city"", is not the primary goal. The success of the people ought to be the primary goal. Example: hospitals weren't originally conceived to make money and grow. They were conceived to aid people who were sick. These days hospitals make a LOT OF MONEY , despite being classified as nonprofit institutions in the USA. As a result we have bad medical practice - over prescription of opioids, over use of surgeries, over-use of diagnostic tests, etc., - all of which benefits the hospital but not the patients. It's not always a clear line - look at the real jobs vs environment issues in mining or fracking. But the balance we have struck now, gives great profits to the companies (profits are at record highs) while income inequality is also at record highs. How is that sensible or sustainable. Or moral? My key point here is that your statement that ""it's not practical for the store"" is misguided. The store's well being cannot be the primary goal of commerce. We need to place a higher priority on benefiting people. (Broadly framed - not just owners of the store)"
