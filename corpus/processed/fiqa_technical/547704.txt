You have to wonder, don't you? Is he leaving because he finally realises the business is entirely a scam? That it's nothing more than a payday loan scheme, charging 25% interest, but the loan comes from the driver! They effectively borrow large sums of money (which are car maintenance costs deferred for the future) from themselves, and have to work like a dog to do it. A payday loan is a much more ethical thing, and not hidden behind math that Uber drivers are incapable of performing. Even if you ahve a very efficient car, the most you can ever make driving fro Uber is 6 cents a mile, net profit. If you think 6 cents a mile is an equitable payment, then by all means, become an Uber driver! Driving 100 miles will net you $6. On the odd occasion I have had to use my car for work, the accepted rate to charge it out at (just to cover the running costs!) is 90 cents per kilometre, or $1.45 per mile. That figure is what it actually costs to run a car. It does not include any payment for actually driving the car.
