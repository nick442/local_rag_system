It's just like any other ad, the idea isn't necessarily for you to go to Gatorade.com and get a truckload delivered as soon as you see their TV ad when watching ESPN- the goal is to put the brand in your mind. 3 days later you're at the store and on the juice and soda aisle and are thinking 'why get a case of Pepsi when I can grab some Gatorade and be a little healthier like LeBron James, I work out sometimes, probably I need to stay better hydrated.' Swap out the product of your choice appropriately if that metaphor doesn't fly for you. You're scrolling through Google results and see a Galaxy S8 ad and you're more likely to give them a look when you're shopping for your next phone- they're not expecting you to go to the website and buy one now, but based on your search history they know you're into technology (you googled 'best phone 2017' once), your phone plan is probably ending soon (you searched 'sprint contract'), your carrier sells the S8 (from that time you clicked a link reading 'how to avoid sprint early termination fee') and you like being on the cutting edge of stuff (you watched a video entitled 'is my iPhone waterproof'). Boom- you're the target market. There's a couple million people just like you- which is why ad impressions are as important as click-throughs and are billed appropriately. Sure- the guy that clicks the link is more likely to buy, but you read it and are thinking about it- so on the aisle you'll think 'Gatorade, eh, why not?'.
