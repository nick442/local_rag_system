Background: Graduated Highschool last June and am currently working a construction job making $19.50/hr working 45-50 hr weeks. I'm working the full year to save up money for university. Currently paying off $10000 loan for my car. Question: So I roughly need $40000 for school and figure I'll still be short of that amount saved even if i work the full year. Do you guys think it's smart for me to take a 2nd gap year and make another $35000-$40000 that would not only finish paying off my school but would also sit in a blue chip stock account making me some income while attending school. Should I take the 2nd gap year or enroll in university next September? Thanks!
