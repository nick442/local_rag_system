I totally agree. Been a tech guy for years, (with a passing interest in finance to get my cfa level 1) but I have noticed a clear tilt for using big data to solve problems in the world and I imagine that at the upper end, all quants are now done via data analytics. And slowly it looks like even fundamentals can be turned into data to solve similar problems. (I.e. this is how I am doing lead generation and prospecting for a client) I honestly feel like anyone who wants to be in the business of offering insight will one day need all of the skills you mentioned.
