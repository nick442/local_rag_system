Incoming is often free except from overseas.. I've never found a bank offering free international wire transfers. Is this coming from a foreign country or another part of the USA? If it is from a foreign country, at some banks (HSBC, perhaps) you can get US$ checks for US payments, at a lower cost than a wire transfer but you have to be careful because the exchange rate might be different. If the transfers occur wholly within the USA there is really no good reason to use wire transfer if you can avoid it. ACH is usually free and is the same way direct deposit works. Use that, or if it is within a family (like for college) you could even use postdated checks.
