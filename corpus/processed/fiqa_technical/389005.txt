This crisis just shows why the dollar has no chance in my lifetime of loding it's dominance. Russia is a major world player, were taking what seemed right steps to move forward economically, socially, politically. Yet this crisis shows the truth. Media controlled by the kremlin. Taking actions in other countries. No fear of economic hardships due to political issues. Who else could supplant the US dollar? China is in the same boat as Russia. Still not a free society. SO what's left? The Euro. But it's got a long way to go to show it can remain stable. Give it 50 years and get back to me.
