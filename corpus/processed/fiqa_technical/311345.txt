Interestingly, the Staples doesn't own most of the land their stores operate on like its competitors. They opted for leases versus buying land during expansion to focus capex on other parts of the business. However, it leaves the company without a lot of land and therefore low relative book value. The value in Staples lies in their online B2B in a direct business model, though how much growth lies in physical paper and ink in a world of tablets and computers remains to be seen.
