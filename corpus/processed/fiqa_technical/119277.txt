Is this really a net effect of concentration of wealth? When so few people hold all the money, you need more money to keep the system running. Imagine we need 10 trillion to keep the economy running. If 1000 people hold 50%, you effectively need 5 trillion just to keep the economy running. It is somewhat ironic that the last time we had full employment was basically the real estate bubble where tons of money was dumped into the system by liar loans with no credit check. Not saying we want to go back there, but perhaps we need that level of money in the system to get full employment. If we want to get there safely, we need to buy back our debt, invest more in our infrastructure and provide more services. This is the only way we are going to get full employment
