I think there is some confusion. I am saying I don’t understand. Not that “the point is not understandable”. I make these comments in hopes that someone can educate me. Yet I’m downvoted and criticized and receive none of the info I was curious about. Is there a sub that discusses economics as opposed to shouting down people that have questions as having bad logic? Could you help me phrase my lack of understanding in a way that conforms to the expected decorum on this subreddit?
