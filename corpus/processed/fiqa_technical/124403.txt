You have a good point, right now the way people raise money at the micro level is hitting up relatives or shmoozing the boys at the country club. It would be cool if there were local exchanges, but I guess the reason there isn't right now is the costs to run such a thing would have to be borne by small companies and investors, and it's 'cheaper' to just raise money informally. But with the internet revolution, seems like that would lower the costs somewhat.
