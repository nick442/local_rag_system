For two reasons primarily: For one, it is very simply because China is at a different stage in its economic development than the USA. That is just a fact. Secondly and more verbosely, the nation of China is experiencing predictable short-term gains that are primarily the result of modernization in best practices, technical skills, and equipment. The reality of the Chinese economy is that it is mostly fueled by a global need for cheap labor and a lot of it. This is thrusting many of China's still 3rd world citizens into modern era industry and production through the many nationalized development and relocation projects taken on by the government. These base realities of Chinas 'economic development', when set against any relevant metric, are in no way indicative of economic success. If anything, the growth China is experiencing underscores the ever-present reality and impact of capitalistically driven market-based economies. In the short term, the nation will have increasing challenges appeasing and suppressing the nation's workforce as workers fight for improved workers rights/conditions. In the long-term, the nation/government will struggle with managing and planning the nation's inevitable transition into a market-based consumer economy as all those workers, in turn, spend their newly acquired wealth. In all truth, the Chinese government is almost singularly driving growth by sacrificing untold amounts of money and Chinese lives to advance an agenda that increases domestic production and attempts to modernize the largely 3rd world population into the 21st century. *As a final note. The nations concerning disregard in the pursuit of modernizing its workforce and domestic production can best be classified as a series of human rights violations. Especially when considering the impacts and conditions for many in Chinas workforce.*
