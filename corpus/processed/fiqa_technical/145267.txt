"This is hysterical. Trickle down economics once again! ""Hey guys, if we make them not be able to move to new firms in the state, they'll stay forever and we'll make money!!"" More like your educated students will go to school out of state to avoid this, and people will move states altogether for better paying jobs and lifestyle. It's like Idaho is trying to get their citizens to leave Idaho. It's Idaho. They need to every incentive to keep citizens there."
