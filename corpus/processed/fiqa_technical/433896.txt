Of course you wouldn't, and of course data is incredibly important. What I'm saying is that you at least have access to rudimentary data about what people are interested in, public data sources, etc that didn't even exist in the past. In the past, small businesses were flying incredibly blind. The data small businesses do have access to today didn't even exist except in either very expensive data collection firms or in hard to get physical records in the past. A small company is never going to have the resources of a large one - at any point in history
