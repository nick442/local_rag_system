Keep in mind collectors are trying to get you to react emotionally, which is having some effect as you are considering bankruptcy. ..threatening me with judgments.. Did they threaten to take away your first born son too? Many of their threats are empty. Even if you do have a judgement, you may be able to negotiate with the lawyer that is handling the judgement. Once you don't pay them anything for a few years, they are more likely to negotiate. It is good that you recognize that it was your dumb decisions that got you into this mess. Once on the other side of all this cleaning up that you have to do what will you change so this does not happen again? What raises a red flag for me is that you are worried about your credit score. Trying to have a good credit score is what got you into this mess in the first place. Stop borrowing.
