https://thepointsguy.com/2017/01/how-government-officials-fly/ The main reason you see so many people in first class is because they earn miles for themselves (just like anyone else can earn miles) but they are not allowed to spend those miles on anything other than upgrades and other perks. The one thing that is absolutely not allowed is to spend those miles on personal travel. Most of those government employees that you see in those seats are frequent last minute travelers due to the nature of their jobs. There will be certain routes handled primarily by certain airlines as they already bid for the business. The airlines miles on those routes for employees will be greatly discounted, but the airline miles associated with them are still calculated at the cost before the discount (most private companies with specific contracts with airline routes work the same). Unions are free to make their own rules on these things. However I do know that many legitimate charities have policies similar to the government for how they can use airline miles. So in short, it's because they can't use their airline miles for anything except upgrades. They can't even keep money received from being bumped from a flight. Edit: In another response, it appears this article could be wrong about using your own miles for personal use (thanks (/u/workacct20910) for steering me to look more at it): https://www.gsa.gov/policy-regulations/regulations/federal-management-regulation-fmr?asset=90778#wp1091613 It appears temp duty travel miles can be used for personal trips. Another poster pointed out people flying enough to get lots of miles will also be elite status, and thus get upgraded much more often even though their base fare is still coach.
