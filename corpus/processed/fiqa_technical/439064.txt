These are for Jane Street Capital. JSC is considered to be one of the top quant marker makers on the street with a majority of their traders having phds. I honestly would not study with these. On this site, they are all from the first or second round of interviews. JSC conducts 4 rounds on phone and one in person. While they are intellectually stimulating, if you have any shot of getting a job there, all the questions you'll find you should already be able to solve.
