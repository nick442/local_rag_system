I can confirm their products are complete and total crap with the exception of their diapers. They're about twice as expensive as regular diapers but everything about them works twice as well. I honestly wish having a kid wasn't so expensive and these diapers have made things even more expensive but we tried a few brands including cloth and these are absolutely the best we found.
