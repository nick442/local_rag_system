I worked at TRU in 1990. Night crew. Hilariously fun. In 1995, I did a consult for their executive team for some database stuff. I mentioned I was an employee, we got to talking, I saw their processes and mindset.. Things haven't really changed from 1990 to 1995 and from 1995 to now. They have somewhat of an idea of what to do, they just can't seem to get it done. I shopped there over Xmas. I could tell more stories. Sad thing is, I told them what they needed to do 16 years ago. I think half the reason they hooked up with amazon.com was because doing it right and starting over from scratch was too much for them. Their entire operation is still connected to bad practices from the past.
