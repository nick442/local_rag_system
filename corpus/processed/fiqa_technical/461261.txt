Raise wages by 20%, and cut the work force by 25%. Drive suppliers from expensive countries if production, like China, and to lower cost options like Vietnam to cut costs by another 1-2%.

And, pay for school in cash, which you can earn by working for $12 per hour at Target before you go making babies and what not. If you can manage to control yourself for a few years.
