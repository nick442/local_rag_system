"> it's because most taxpayers don't vote, but all government employees do vote. That's not the problem. The problem is that unions can make political contributions. The employees are forced to make union contributions and the union then has a pot of money to influence the legislators. Look up how the prison guards union supported ""get tough on crime"" laws, which led to more people in prison, which led to more prison guards, which led to more money for the union to spend on ""get tough on crime"" laws."
