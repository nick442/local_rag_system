He is doing an important service though. Yes there are CEOs that will have to deal with a bunch of absurd fact-checking requests from him when they could be running their business, but he's also the one exposing frauds and making people who are planning frauds hesitate. I think the dodgy part is that he's doing stuff like this to boost his social media presence and reach the largest audience possible. Whereas other similar firms probably still plan on releasing the huge, thorough research as their catalysts, it seems like he really enjoys tweeting. I'm 100% sure his account is linked to bots at other funds to automatically short any ticker he mentions. This could potentially compromise the quality of his research, which is important because there are so few others that do the same service.
