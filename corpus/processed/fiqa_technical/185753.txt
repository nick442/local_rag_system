"Problem is, my CEO told me I would ""get a raise every 12 days"" ""dollar here, dollar there"". It's been 5 months of excellent work on my part, no bonus, no raise, nothing. I mean, I'm upset, but I wish I at least got recognized for my work. If it weren't for me doing something that got the attention of his wife (who also works here), he wouldn't even recognize me."
