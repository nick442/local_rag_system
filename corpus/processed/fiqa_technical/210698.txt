"This is horse shit. You're citing liberal propaganda as fact. ""Cited as the anti scientist president."" By whom? Just liberals with their dress over their heads. This Nature article is junk, it's just an opinion piece, a few quotes from literally who, and a random bar graph. Trump won on income and was inversely proportional on education. Jeez who would have thunk it, lifers post docs are bought it on their liberal academic surroundings. As if that was indicative of intelligence."
