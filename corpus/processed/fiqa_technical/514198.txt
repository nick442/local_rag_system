"I've found that the most effective way to get things done is to communicate directly in person, or over the phone if the former is not possible, then to follow up with an immediate email - ""per our conversation, etc."" This allows the natural personable conversations to occur, connecting you with you team members and direct reports, while also holding everyone accountable in writing. Accountability isn't about being able to say ""I told you so!"" nor is it about waiting for an opportunity to make someone look bad. Accountability is about ensuring that no one falls behind or lets the team down in the first place through preventative measures. This comes back full circle to my point on personable communication; the most effective method of management in my experience is simply leading by example. When you lead by example you never need to threaten employees with discipline or ""accountability;"" you simply do what you do and if people respect you for the way you work, they will look up to you as a role model. Your team members will do everything they can to support the team's objectives on their own accord. Source: I learned this through a former manager. He motivated me to be more committed to the team's objectives and now I get to pay that forward to my direct reports. Edit: typos, on mobile."
