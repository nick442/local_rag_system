The oat cream is even better. Unlike soy cream it behaves just like normal cream for cooking. My wife can't deal with cream and until we discovered oat cream I had to drop a lot of awesome stuff from our menu. I still bring it back every time I visit Europe. (I have also secretly been hoping for a stop because you are not supposed to bring in dairy products, but the customs boys are either keen or - more likely - not paying attention)
