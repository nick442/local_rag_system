>PI’s attorney, Dan Webb, said in court Monday that ABC used the term “pink slime” 350 times over the course of its reporting, and that ABC willfully spread this preconceived, negative message. Webb also showed the jurors a picture of lean finely textured beef. “It physically doesn’t look like slime,” he said. It physically doesn't look like slime, and presumably it isn't slime chemically. What's their reason for calling it 'pink slime'? >In fact, the term “pink slime” was coined by one of the segment’s whistleblowing USDA scientists in a 2002 email to colleagues, and a 2009 New York Times piece using the term to describe BPI’s meat product won a Pulitzer Prize. So, they coined a word to describe something that was intentionally designed to sensationalize it, in a negative way. If I were on the jury this is the point of fact that I'd base my vote on. The media needs to be slapped pretty hard when they start actively damaging people and companies to sell stories.
