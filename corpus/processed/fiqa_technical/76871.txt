If you truly have > 22% equity, they have to stop it. However, without an appraisal, how do you know if you have > 22% equity? If you bought the house for 100k, and paid your mortgage down to 78k, but now the house is only worth 78k, you have 0% equity, not 22% equity. Without an appraisal, you have no idea how much equity you have. Yeah, it sucks, but that's how equity is calculated: based on the current value, not the past value.
