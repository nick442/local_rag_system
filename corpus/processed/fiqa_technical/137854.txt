I don't think I could stand listening to him for 10 seconds without throwing the radio out the window, but he works his ass off and I respect him for that. He is his own brand and everything he does is inspected by a hundred million eyeballs. I would not care to be in that position. Haters gonna hate especially when you are self made millionaire by 16. Also Scooter! That guy took some squeaky kid, saw something in him I still don't see in him, and turned him into a golden goose. Hate his product if you have to, but he is a fucking genius.
