"Well, with a (pretend) 40 hour work week, it comes out to about $480/hour, which is easily 10x what most people make, many of whom also have always-on-call jobs. Despite being always on call, 24/7 isn't quite the right description.. I think it's more fair to assume/compare to 80-100 hours/week. That would still net comfortably around $200/hr. Yu als have to add in perks and bonuses, as CEO salary is typically 1/3 to 1/4 of their total compensation (remember, Steve Jobs was since 2003 the highest paid CEO in the country, with a 'salary' of $1/year). With the total package against total hours actually worked (including sorting email and taking phone calls at home on your own tine), I would still estimate the total package to be around $400-500/hour. A generous sum it is, but I still agree with your main point.. I wouldn't want it. I feel like after you can afford a nice house with a room for each member of the family, a reliable car for each driver, and tuition to send kids to a bratty private school and college, the ""usefulness"" of money drops way, way off."
