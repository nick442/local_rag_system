"Removal of Net Neutrality is a vote for **double billing consumers!** Many consumers already overpay for their internet service (physical and wireless), and most people don't realize that websites also pay for internet access. That second fee is built into the site's business model (e.g., ad-supported, subscription, etc.) Sites could more effectively fight for Net Neutrality with a financial campaign like this.. Subscription services could highlight the ""hidden"" cost of website internet access as a line item on their invoices. For example: * Netflix $5.50 * Verizon Access Fee $3.50 * Total Price $8.00 or * Netflix $5.75 * AT&T Access Fee $4.25 * Total Price $10.00 Of course, removing Net Neutrality means that Netflix would need to jack up it's prices for customers depending on who their ISP is (to meet whatever crazy quality of service fees the ISPs want to tack on) - and that seriously messes with Netflix's business. However, by using invoice line items, consumers, and their politicians would quickly realize that ISPs are double dipping. Maybe Netflix could simply threaten this reality? The more interesting problem is ad supported businesses like Google and Facebook. Any removal of Net Neutrality will lead to higher fees paid by advertisers, and most likely further annoyances to consumers with yet **more fucking ads** that try to pay for this insanity. Advertisers themselves are disgruntled with digital advertising, and it would be interesting if they too realized that ISPs were ultimately screwing them with quality of service fees. Can you imagine - some advertisers will pay more for that quality of service to force yet more ads on you! But the really scary part isn't Net Neutrality - it's the data rape that ISPs engage in to get those sweet sweet ad dollars. [Back in March, that debate came and went with a fizzle](http://money.cnn.com/2017/03/28/technology/house-internet-privacy-repeal/index.html). Probably because Google and Facebook also need to data rape people to support their business models."
