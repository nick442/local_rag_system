I have to disagree. Millenials still have time for it to get better. We Gen Xers are losing our highest earning years of our lives while the Millenials are losing the lowest. Most people spend their 20s figuring out their lives and their 30s and 40s building their family and retirement. The Millenials simply have less to lose and have suffered far less of an impact.
