"They are right to ask for the money back because you were not entitled to that money. However, you may have a defense called ""laches"". Basically, you can try to show that because of the government's unreasonable delay in asking for the money back, in the meantime you relied on the assumption that it was your money in good faith, and spent it, and now to have to come up with the money that you assumed you wouldn't need would cause great harm to you."
