I have a possibly super dumb question especially being just old enough to have had records as a kid. Since modern recording essentially goes straight to digital at the studio level does putting it into an analog format after the fact influence the fidelity of playing off vinyl compared to the old analog recording methods? Im not an audiophile or anything but curious if someone with an ear would ever know the difference.
