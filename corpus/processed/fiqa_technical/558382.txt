"This post may be old anyhow here's my 2 cents. Real world..no. Compounding is overstated. I have 3 mutual funds, basically index funds, you can go look them up. vwinx, spmix, spfix in 11 years i've made a little over 12,000 on 50,000 invested. That averages 5%. That's $1,200 a year about. Not exactly getting rich on the compounding ""myth?"". You do the math. I would guess because overly optimistic compounding gains are based on a straight line gains. Real world..that aint gonna happen."
