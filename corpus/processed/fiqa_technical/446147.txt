I'm no pro with how all this stuff works, but you can make a company look more profitable. FedEx structure is pretty complex and I'm no MBA/Accountant. They have like 7 companies under the FedEx Corporation shell company and 100's of accountant and lawyers. I'm sure this is true of many fortune 500 companies.
