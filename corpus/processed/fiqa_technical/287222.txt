The terms of IL state pensions are among the most generous in the entire country and the state is swimming in debt due to them. The unions own the democratic pols in IL and it's been an incestuous relationship between the two. Politicians get union money for elections, elected politicians give unions generous pension payouts that basically burden the taxpayer to obscene levels. Why is IL the largest net migration in the 50 states? Why isn't Indiana or Wisconsin facing the same problems? Oh that's right, they got rid of their public sector unions and that's why citizens of IL have about $40,000 more in debt than their neighbors.
