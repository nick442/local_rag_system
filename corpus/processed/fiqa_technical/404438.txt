"Unfortunately, in the coming weeks middle-class workers will be subjected to a nonstop propaganda barrage about tax cuts being for ""greedy corporations,"" ""fat cats,"" ""Wall Street"" and ""the rich."" Don't believe it. It's rank class warfare, based entirely on progressive fairy tales about the U.S. economy. By supporting corporate and small-business tax cuts that will boost investment, create more and better jobs, and raise average workers' incomes, Americans won't just be cutting taxes for businesses. They'll be cutting their own taxes, too."
