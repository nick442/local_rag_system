Yes I have. Most modern people would die within days of being dropped into a wilderness. In historical hunter-gatherer societies, people receive extensive survival training during their childhood (just as modern children are trained to survive in a modern society). They learn to know where food where food can be found, what is good to eat, etc, etc.. If the environment is not one that easily supports survival (with training), then there tend to be fewer people there.
