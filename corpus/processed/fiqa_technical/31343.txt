"I think you're missing a fixed and variable breakout cost per unit here. Fixed costs per unit decrease as volume rises. If you think VC and equity peeps would throw down bills to a company who can't reasonably argue or support a cash generating model, you're likely mistaken. Uber's infrastructure and rapid scaling are cost intensive, however, once implemented, their costs do not rise 1:1 with every person who hails an Uber, which is what you're implying by leaving us two identical profit margins at vastly different volumes, which only exists in fairy-tale ""unicorn"" land. Also, to your comments below: Oh wow, you think a tech company is overvalued? Like that's not the real ""soundbite"" - same fuckin' soundbite I heard when Amazon was trading at 200 a share."
