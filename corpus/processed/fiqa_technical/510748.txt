> I'd be interested in seeing a little more on the regulatory aspects of derivative contracts. The most relevant regulatory push is with Dodd Frank in how it regulates swaps. There are a myriad of rules around swaps of all kinds due to DF, whether they be interest rate swaps, fx swaps, commodity swaps, etc. In a nutshell, DF requires certain reporting and transparency requirements for swaps (not to be confused with futures contracts, which are heavily regulated as well). At some point most swaps that can be done on a cleared basis will have to be done on a cleared basis (versus bilateral swaps, which is simply one counterparty entering into a swap agreement with another counterparty, meaning each c/p is exposed to the other's credit worthiness). DF is a long, boring read, but that is what is most relevant if you want to understand how swaps are being regulated and will be regulated going forward.
