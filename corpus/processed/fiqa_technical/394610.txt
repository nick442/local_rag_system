Dean's list every semester, graduated summa cum laude and was a Hamilton Scholar. He actually completed two undergrad majors in 4 1/2 yrs which incl. a semester studying abroad. He just graduated and entered the job market at the wrong time (just as the world economy crashed and no-one was hiring). He was Dean's list and graduated with honours for the MBA from a highly regarded Canadian University. Within 6 months he had an interview, followed by gov't tests and then his job offer. Didn't hurt that the Dean was one of his references.
