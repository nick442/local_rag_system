Yup, scanning and entering the database must've been expensive but assuming that's up and running and the code/site is paid and working well, they're just paying for the bandwidth at this point. I'd imagine they'd have a huge chunk of change left over from that 300mil low-end estimate of revenue. Still, it's amazing to me to think this business is that large, as a younger person i had no idea that this was so popular, it'd assumed it was a niche within a niche.
