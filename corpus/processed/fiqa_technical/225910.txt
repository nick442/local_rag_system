Unfortunately, I'm not the guy that makes the call about hires. You should talk to the institutional guys - get to know them, find out where they go for drinks and show up and just shoot the shit and chit chat. Be outgoing and joke around. Mention you'd like a shot and to keep you in mind if something opens up. I can tell you that in this industry the first thing people look for is if the candidate is a good fit for the team - both in terms of attitude, culture and overall fit. Leverage what you have. They already know you.
