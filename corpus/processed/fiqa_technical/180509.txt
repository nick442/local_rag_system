"I'm not trying to suggest otherwise or argue that financial institutions have access to different types of services not normally offered to Joe the Plumber. My argument is that if these Wall St. types are *soooo* bad, then why are people still giving them their money? The answer is because people want that ""Baby Boomer"" -esque type of retirement where they don't have to actually do any work at building their retirement.. just give a cut of their paycheck to these men who turn it into more money. I can turn money into more money. I've taken some of my money, invested in tools, and used those tools (and some of my time and sweat) to make more money. That didn't require an *evil evil* Wall St. man."
