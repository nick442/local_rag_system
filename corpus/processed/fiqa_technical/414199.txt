"Dictionary clarifies http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/be-in-credit Definition of be in credit: (Of an account) have money in it: ""your statement shows your account to be in credit"" And http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/be-in-debit?q=in+debit Definition of be in debit: (Of an account) show a net balance of money owed to others: ""the account is only 120 francs in debit"" The word 'debit' contains the letters 'debt' if it helps remember. I agree the website is confusing."
