This is not totally not in my wheelhouse, so I'm genuinely asking: Isn't that because gas being purchased on that date has to be purchased at the new high rate, but when selling gas already purchased at the higher old rate has to be sold at the high rate to avoid a loss? Like, given good faith actors on all sides with no particular profit motive, shouldn't we see prices raise quicker than they fall at the pump anyways?
