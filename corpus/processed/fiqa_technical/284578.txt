Of course not. But you walked into this with your eyes open, did you not? Did you think it was going to be 20 min a week or did you know what you were agreeing to? You are asking to jump your price 300% a day into the work. Your friends are in a tight spot already, there is a time crunch until these tests, and her passing or not has real consequences for her. If it were me it would seem clear you lowballed me to get me to say yes then are leveraging that to a massive price hike assuming I won't want to change tutors once you've started. If we were friends we wouldn't be after this. Honestly I think your best option is to go to them and apologize. Say you did not understand the commitment you were making and you do not think you are the right person to tutor their daughter. Offer to continue working with her until they find a proper tutor. If they offer more money maybe you can discuss it but don't you bring it up. They may. I'm not sure about in Europe but in the USA even $10/hr is way below average for a private tutor. That's more like prices for a group test prep course. You definitely lowballed yourself on price and the rate you are thinking is probably a reasonable if not discounted one still. If this weren't involving friends you could be more firm on needing to push up the price because if they walk away angry it's just a lost customer. But doing business with friends is always messier. I could be wrong here, but are you maybe closer to the daughter's age? Are these family friends more accurately your parent's friends? If I'm off on that my advise above stands. If I'm right, think about how your actions will affect the friendship between your parents and this family. Might want to talk with them about it first.
