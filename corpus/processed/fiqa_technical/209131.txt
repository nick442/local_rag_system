The answer is far more simple. The purchasers of periphery debt have been banks in the periphery. Since these countries don't have a central bank, their private banks were swallowing the national debt since nobody else wanted to touch it. When the market value of that debt plummets, the banks have massive holes they need to fill on their balance sheets to fulfill capital requirements and solvency. Therefore, the banks themselves need to be injected with liquidity. Now you can see why its a reiterative problem.
