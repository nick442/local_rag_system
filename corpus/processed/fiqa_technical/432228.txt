Just more sour grapes from those who made their money off arbitrage and got beat by someone quicker. Anyhow, speaking as a normal investor (ie. someone who invests my own money), HFT is what allows me to put in an order in New York, Hong Kong, or Paris from my web browser, and have it executed 10 seconds later. Anyone who's tried trading on a market with less liquidity (say, the TSX Venture exchange) knows it's a pain in the ass to buy and sell, and often you'll get screwed. Electronic trading and HFT has democratized trading. Sure, you pay a few cents per trade, but when I buy a stock on the HK market I'm paying ~300 HK dollars per trade anyway. Heck, even on NA exchanges, when trading >10 000 dollars the amount shaved off by HFT traders is minute. I'll gladly pay it for the convenience - I can put in a trade and have it executed instantly, so that I can go to bed and sleep, rather than wait hours to see if my trade will be executed..
