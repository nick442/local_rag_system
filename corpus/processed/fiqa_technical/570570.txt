"Again massive generalisations I haven't looked at the numbers at all, so could be way off, and it will be a local issue. If overall housing demand > supply; little movement in price If current supply = current demand; then the increase in supply should lower prices a little. I'd expect a lot of conversions to enable greater access to the housing market from first time buyers (which is generally where the growth comes from). If current supply > current demand (rare, Detroit, some ""company towns"" where the company has left etc) ; prices should already be depressed, more supply pushes them lower still. If people can keep up with mortgage payments then all okay, if not repossessions. I doubt this option is large enough to carry much risk. I'm fairly sure any bank has people far smarter, and far more qualified, than me looking at macro trends with actual data, so whatever shocks are coming from the boomers dying off will be well managed."
