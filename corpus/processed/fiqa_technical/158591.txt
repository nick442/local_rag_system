"I'm of the same line of thinking. The reddit community has been an amazing resource for me in the past on items like this. I have my areas of expertise (as a lawyer I have a ""binders full of precedents""), but loan proposals are not one of those areas. And when I deal in areas I don't have mastered, I like to consider examples where professionals might consider the job ""well done"" in order to question, push back, or assist my own professionals."
