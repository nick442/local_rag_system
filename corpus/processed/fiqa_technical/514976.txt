> Wal-Mart will hire desperate people, because those desperate people are less likely to complain or have pro-Union sentiments. correction. walmart hires them because they have a low marginal utility undeserving of a higher wage. if they could get a higher wage somewhere else, they would. how many people do you employ? do you give money to millions of people? didn't think so. don't complain about other people offering jobs. > Wal-Mart is transferring the cost of labor onto the taxpayers. This should make you upset. i'm mad at the government for giving them aid. i don't think i should have control over a private business. but im supposed to have control over my government.
