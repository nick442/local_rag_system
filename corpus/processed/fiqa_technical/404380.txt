Keep in mind that the only portion of the MBS that was rated AAA was the most senior tranche. It achieved this rating due to the buffer to principal losses provided by the equity and mezzanine tranches. So for the principal to be at risk for the AAA senior tranche, 10% of the mortgages in the pool would have to default. Since this number was way higher than historical default rates - it seemed safe. Obviously looking back we know that risk management underestimated the effect that lowered lending standards would have on the default rates (if they did project a rise in default rates, they did not project a large enough rise). As well, while the MBS is exposed to systemic risk - as happened, when the entire country was affected by the collapse - they were packaged to avoid other risks. For example, the pool would spread out mortgages across the country and other various factors would be hedged so that if a natural disaster hits state X and everyone defaults on their mortgage, you are only losing a small part of the underlying. I assume (hope) that at some point the quantitative analysis people in risk management at the major investment banks realized that the default rates would rise given the lower lending standards being employed - but chose to ignore it. They chose to ignore it because investors still wanted to buy it, and the banks make money by collecting fees on issuing securities.
