"This is an easy question - The US government has demonstrated, repeatedly, that it **will** bail out the ""established"" auto industry. Tesla is very very cool, and may well bury the rest of the auto industry eventually, but they're not viewed as ""too big to fail"". Thus, Ford's bonds, even if *practically* ""junk"", are essentially backed by US Treasury; that's a pretty good deal, if you're looking for ultra low risk."
