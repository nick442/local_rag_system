Last stat I read was that about 20% of oil consumption is due to ice vehicles. Keep in mind electric vehicles need to be charged. Much of that consumption will be fueled by oil. Demand may go down for vehicles, but I Su’s ups to demand will continue to climb for the other 80% of today’s oil consumers.
