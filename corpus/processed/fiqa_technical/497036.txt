Banks also need in-house web developers so if you don't want to switch from doing that then it should be possible. Especially if you are up for working with mobile/ubiquitous computing side of things. That seems to be the next step for retail banking anyway. For investment banking I'm not really sure of the need of web developers. I guess some offer different forms of online platforms (e-trading stuff) but most of what developers do is internal stuff that never see outside customers. Those could be built using similar technologies I guess.
