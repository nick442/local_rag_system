What are your thoughts on companies like Gilead Sciences and Danaher? Over decades they have shown to make astute acquisitions. Do you believe such companies have an institutional decision-making framework that fights against the principal-agent problem you are alluding to? For context: Around the turn the century Gilead bought an HIV drug that became the backbone of a combination therapy they used to gain >90% market share for more than a decade and a half. Second, circa 2013, they bought Pharmasset for ~$11 billion, and since 2014, drugs containing Pharmasset's backbone generated greater than $40 billion in revenue for Gilead.
