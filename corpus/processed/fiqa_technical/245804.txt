In the case of WhatsApp they probably use revenue from the apple affiliate program, this is how it works: After you sign up and are accepted you can generate links. When someone clicks on the link a cookie is installed on their iDevice, this cookie attributes all purchaces generated to the owner of the affiliate link for the life of the cookie (24 hours). The owner will then recive a 7% commission on those purchaces.
