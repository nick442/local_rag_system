I like those links you added. The first one is highlighting that most of the issues of manufacturing of electric cars are shared by their non-electric counterparts. Plus if you live in a clean energy area (I do at least) then the impact is even less than typical. So it is something that is dependent on other eco-friendly movements. The more we push towards sustainable tech and energy, the more Tesla and electric vehicles will benefit. Also, good on you for keeping up on maintenance. It's not too common a thing for people to take good care of their cars.
