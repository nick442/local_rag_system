All governments need to do is figure out how to monitor, regulate and tax whenever BTC (or any crypto) is converted into dollars or merchandise. The public ledger doesn't have names associated with it, but it does have public keys, which can be used to determine what other transactions have taken place that might not have been reported and how much crypto is in that wallet? I agree with Ballsy12, there could be a dark side to crypto that we're not paying attention to because we're all so excited about the money we're making, but it's only money if we can spend it, and that's where it starts to get concerning. Every transaction recorded is a bean counters wet dream.
