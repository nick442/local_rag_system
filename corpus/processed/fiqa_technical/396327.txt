I had a plumber come over for a free estimate on my sink and wanted $110 an hour to remove a rusted bolt and install a new faucet (did it my self after asking him how he would do it). The AC guys seem to make a big profit on labor as well. Seems like learning these types of skills could have you earning a good living and could not be automated for a long time.
