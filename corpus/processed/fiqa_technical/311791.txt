What kind of business? LinkedIn is very good for businesses like Real Estate where personal relationships are key. If you are in a business where it is important to know the person you are doing business with, you can benefit a lot from it. First, make sure you have a good profile. There are plenty of places on LinkedIn where you can get tips how to do this. Next, make sure you have a good profile photo that fits you. If you are in your 20s, this means something in a business suit, not holding a cocktail at a party, for instance. If you are over 50, you may want to be doing something active in the photo to convey your good health and vigor! :) Also, there are resources on LinkedIn for this. There are different schools on the next topic, however, I feel you should not connect to anyone you do not know. You would be exposing all of your connections to someone who may end up spamming your network. It is not worth the risk. Don't connect unless they are recommended or it is someone you met. Go to networking events and afterwards, connect with interesting or useful-to-your-business people you met at the event. Keep your network fresh by emailing or having lunch with some of these people on occasion. It is always nice to have an up to date network. You never know when you will have a professional question or even when you may be looking for a job. I do it more for fun than anything. It is a lot of fun to meet new people!
