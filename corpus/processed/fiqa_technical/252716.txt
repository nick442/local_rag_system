Sorry, this isn't terribly helpful and I would post this as a comment but I'm new and apparently can't. Some considerations: 7% seems awfully high. Check SoFi and see if you can't refinance at a rate low(er) enough rate so that you won't be paying so much interest. How does reinvesting 10k into the company compare to paying off loans? 1.5 years in, you've paid down a lot of interest already.. We would need a lot of particulars to give you specific advice, probably more than you're willing to give over the internet. Who does the financials for you business? They should be able to give you advice, or at least build the models specific for your situation to help you make a decision.
