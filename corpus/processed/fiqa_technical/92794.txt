Sure there is expense, however anyone who raises their kids even with the hint of frugality will never come close to their base numbers. My wife and I both worked before three having kids and at least for us the outgoing costs pretty much the same as the money spent without kids. How, you say? Because you budget on what you make. What changes when you have kids is your lifestyle and how you spend your money. Bar tab = diapers, weekend getaways = 1 big disney vaction, convertible = minivan, etc. There is an opportunity cost, but according to these folks they seem to be assuming you are spending money you are normally saving on kids, when in truth you would have more than likely spent it on yourself.
