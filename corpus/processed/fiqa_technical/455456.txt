Outside of maintaining systems? Some IT guys get plugged into quant roles, not so much of the hardcore analytics, but maintaining models, programming in different languages, etc. Look at high frequency trading shops, they use engineers / math majors as their bread and butter to code algorithmic trading models. Lots of data-mining goes into these models, pulling up enormous amounts of historical trading data, determining patters, modifying the data to compensate for new variables. Hope this helps.
