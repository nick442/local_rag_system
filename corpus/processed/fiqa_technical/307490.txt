"I think the survey needs to be broken down to ""as a consumer.."" and ""as a merchant.."" I'm not sure any service like the one you propose can be really implemented on the consumer side. In particular, I suspect few if any consumers would pay for the privilege You might look into the company ""Neat"" who sold a specialized scanner and software package designed around organizing reciepts a while back. Retailer buy-in is a huge factor too. You can create a platform and encourage retailers to send reciepts via email or whatever, but at the end of the day, a lot of retailers still see value in a reciept 5x as long as it should be to itemize the 22 ways you ""saved money"" and the 19 cross-promotions or coupons they want to inform you of. Unless you can provide equal percieved value for them, they won't be interested, even if consumers like the concept. The classic example in this debate is the US chain ""CVS Pharmacy""-- whose long reciepts are the butt of many jokes, but persist because they're part of an elaborate reward scheme where they give people coupons in the hopes of them coming back to use them. As for the smaller vendors who may not be as tied to such strategies, they're also likely going to be less technically equipped to cope with a new feature. You almost need to target the POS vendors like NCR and IBM-- if you can make ""electronic reciept"" a feature in their platform, it becomes something that hundreds of stores are getting built into their systems for ""free"" and they just have to turn it on. That's a lot easier than selling to every single retailer one at a time, and it would be a big enough launch that you could start to get customer preference"
