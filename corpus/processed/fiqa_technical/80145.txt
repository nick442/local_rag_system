"First of all, many employees (past a few years in particular) are *always* looking for new jobs. It's how they make sure that they're always getting the best value for their services. This is doubly true for ""star"" employees. I don't know if this is some cultural thing, but I can tell you my own experience as an employer of roughly 40 people in Sweden over the last half decade. The business is web development. My take from this infograph is that 1) people who are about to leave do worse work 2) people who are about to leave act differently re:1) I just don't agree with in any way, in fact quite the contrary. People who have left my employment have done better in the last 3-4 months than they have before, just so that they can 1) get a good reference letter and 2) leave my employment on good standing, so that noone feels slighted. Rational, intelligent people do not burn bridges, they build networks. re:2) People who are looking for other jobs act just like they always do. All the ideas for behavioural change presented in this infograph are completely circumstantial. In my experience, the best way to identify employees who are very close to leaving, or seriously considering it, is listening to what they have to say. They'll make sure new messages get through, such as ""this job isn't challenging enough"" or ""I'm not having fun"". If they DON'T make those messages and still leave, it means they didn't think you would be able to change those circumstances. But, of course, that is more or less [equity theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_theory#Equity_theory_in_business) in practice. (edit: just to be clear, the point I'm trying to make here is that star employees have no problems voicing their discontent with current affairs) (edited out some details that could be used to identify the business)"
