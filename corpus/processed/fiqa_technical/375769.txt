Up until now I was looking at general European market and then dividing it up by sectors, but a country-specific distribution would also be a possibility, but I am afraid that the amount of work required to divide things up that much might be too much. Then again, it honestly might not. It could very well be that I'll come across this information during my research and if that's the case, it would certainly be worth incorporating into my paper. My intention is to take pieces of my thesis and turn them into separate specials for my employer to publish if my employer allows me to work on my thesis at work over the summer. We'll see. Hoping to be done by the end of September, so we'll see. I'll certainly be sure to keep the subreddit posted. My thesis will also certainly make it over to my [Scribd](http://www.scribd.com/dwietstruk).
