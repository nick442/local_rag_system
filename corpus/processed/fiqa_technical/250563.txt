"Ok hate speech as a crime has to meet very specific criteria. E.g. the group has to be identifiable and your speech has to be unjust, potentialy harmful and generalized. You gave a very good example of that aka the swedish 70 year old lady who said ( i googled the case): "" Muslims burn cars and piss and shit on the streets"" ( this is the message not the actual words was to lazy looking deeper into this). So she DIDN'T say she saw 1 guy pissing in the streets she knows to be muslim or he just looks like one ( how do muslims look by the way. some i know look like seinfeld characters.) She said ALL muslims pissing and shitting in the streets and set cars on fire... thats a big difference. Comments like this are extremely harmful to the mentioned groups, because innocent people are branded with negative stereotypes. The real world consequence is prosecution and violence which severely limits the freedom of this group. Why do people (fyi ""people"" is not a specific group so no hate speech ðŸ˜‰) not get this. If the same thing happens to a person and not a group it becomes clear: e.g. ""raananh is a liar and steals everything he can and tends to shit on his bosses desk"". This is widely spread and you apply for a job in a law firm. They do not hire you because the boss likes his desk clean. Harm was done to you. You are pissed and righteously sue me because it's illegal to spread untruths about you. You can even do so in the USA ðŸ˜®OMG FREEDOM OF SPEECH. Sweden does many things right and is to this day one of the most open and free countries."
