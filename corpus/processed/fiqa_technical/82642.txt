Oh I definitely wish there were more women in STEM. Though the NYT likes to blame bias from those already in those fields, I suspect that's mostly decades in the past. I'm more inclined to attribute a lot of it to some type of social pressure from female peers, particularly in teenage years where social acceptance is very important, and being the girl who's taking AP Statistics or considering a degree in Accounting is not going to win one acceptance into the popular kids crowd. Which is really unfortunate because being interested in such things really should be encouraged.
