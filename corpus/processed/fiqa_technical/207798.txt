What everyone else is missing is that it's 9% paid with after tax money. Any income you earn on an investment will also be taxed, so you'd need to make a fair bit more than 9% in order to break even with paying off your loan. For example, if your tax bracket is 20%, you have to earn $1.36 for every $1 in loan payment. Take $100 x 0.09 x 1.36 = $12.24 in pre-tax earnings just for interest every year on $100. Multiply that out for whatever the size Pay off your loans first - it's a no-brainer.
