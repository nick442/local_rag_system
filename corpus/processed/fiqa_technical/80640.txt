This is the problem the Republican party has backed themselves into. The idea that, somehow, compensation is *ever* correlated to job creation. Because it isn't. It never has been, especially in CEO pay. Chief executives mostly get payed based on performance, return on investment, increases in shareholder value, etc. This is, in fact, how it works in most front-office jobs on wall street, whether you're an analyst (very low) or a managing director (higher up). As an example, note that both B of A and Goldman's CEOs got their pay cut by a third. They also get these huge increases because all of their wages are public, so people are well aware that there are *very* good counteroffers from other employers.
