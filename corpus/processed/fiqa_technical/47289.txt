That was a simple miscommunication, soupaman, for which I actually apologized. Do trolls apologize? No. Look at magicunderpants for an example of trolling. EDIT: btw, the reason I state my experience *and* our income is simple: it's proof. People who don't bother to even read the simple blog sidebar are going on about how I can't possibly know anything, but oh, I do. And people don't even know that it's possible to do what I do and earn that kind of income. But it is very possible. That's why I talked about numbers when I was invited to be interviewed on Mixergy. You have no idea the kind of fan mail I got for that. Most bootstrapping companies will never reveal their income, but we should: http://unicornfree.com/2011/drawing-back-the-curtain/
