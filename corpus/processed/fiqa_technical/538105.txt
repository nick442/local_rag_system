"I've traveled pretty extensively around the US (probably been to more states than a lot of citizens), love it out west, friends all over the place. Just not really a big city person so that's been holding me back from going to NYC. Friend would love to go there though, and he's really into musicals (and active in them at a professional level here) so of course my first reaction was ""sure, lets go""."
