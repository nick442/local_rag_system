It's a good saving account from the persepective of usability. Easy to open, easy to manage, and free at least in Italy. Anyway be aware that in 2008 you would not probably have been so happy to know that your saving were in bank that was close to go banckrupcy. On October/19/2008 the Ducth government had to inject 10 billions euro into ING Group to save it from a probable collapse. At least the CEO Michel Tilmant was fired, and also 7000 poor employees was cutted off. After that, it seems they just went on selling themslevs in pieces in order to restructure source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ING_Group#History But they also partially repaid the Dutch goverment and now their rating is around A, so it seems to be a safe place to put your saving for now.
