"If you are dead set in being an analyst, just pic a sector you are interested in, read a bunch of quarterly and annual reports and do some financial analysis on their financial statements. When you send in your resume, state quite clearly that you have no official experience in being an analyst ( in your cover letter ), but also attach your findings/work. Even if it is amateur, you will gain some experience in a certain sector and you will up to scruff, even if they don't care about the sector you picked out, they will see that you have done some work besides just showing up with a degree. It will help differentiate you from the rest of the pack. If you have leisure time and not studying for your CFA, look into the book ""Confessions of a Wallstreet Analyst"". It talks about the author going to work in Wallstreet during the telecom boom on the late 1990s. It's interesting and you get a sense of what kind of work he actually did. That sort of insight will help you out and hopefully get your on your path to success. Hope this helped!"
