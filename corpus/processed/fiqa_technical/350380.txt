I don't think you understand what it's saying, not that there were only 8 crashes, that in 8 crashes 28 people died. It's talking about the amount of fatalities/crash for those 8 crashes, which is why the sentence after that talks about curbside operators being more dangerous. There were more than 8 crashes among all the different bus lines in a year.
