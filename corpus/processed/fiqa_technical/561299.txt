Our Website http://alignmentspinecare.com/ A holistic Chiropractor Queens will treat the client until subluxations are fully resolved and then broaden their attention to include general subluxation correction in the entire spine in order to promote general wellness. Both approaches have real value. While imposing limits on treatment based on the limits of what peer-reviewed research can substantiate is important, holistic chiropractors acknowledge that progress in science occurs by pushing the limits of understanding and treating patients in ways that current best evidence may not fully support. The periphery of science is where progress is usually made - though it is also where quackery finds refuge.
