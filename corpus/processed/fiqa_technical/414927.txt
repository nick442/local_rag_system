">Govt. already is quite out of the way. You are subject to more laws and regulations than you could ever be *aware of*, much less compliant to, if you had your entire life to read them. No one on *earth* is fully cognizant of all applicable laws, so don't try that line with me. >All it is doing is setting new rules when needed. That's an extremely naive view. Needed, according to who? To what end? >the govt. is now trying to say - Hang on a min, we need to ensure fairness Your naivete is amazing. The government doesn't give half a shit about fairness, only about protecting its own. >It never prevented HFT's from starting up and operating. No shit? Maybe that's because we don't need the government's permission to try something. >Govt. supports free market In no way is this true. Government itself is an inhibition to free markets. >it wants a refereed and regulated free market Contradiction of terms. There's no such thing as a ""refereed and regulated free market"". >Re. the consumer electronics, last I checked FCC stickers are on most of them. FCC has fuck-all to do with safety, FCC is about non-interference with other devices. Before making statements, please ensure you know what the fuck you're talking about. >Not sure who/what the u/w labs does Now that you've admitted you don't know what the fuck you're talking about, are you willing to take input from someone who *does* know what he's talking about? Somehow I doubt it."
