Well I ship and receive so much through FedEx, USPS and UPS all the drivers in my area know me and they each have intensive notes in the system regarding how to deliver my packages so that's not a problem I have. If they just left packages outside I would lose thousands of dollars a day in stolen merchandise and supplies.
