"Amount is so big it's pretty much incomprehensible. Does it matter who we vote for? If Dems, gvmt grows by social programs. If Repubs, gvmt grows by defense spending or ""Walls"" or whatever. Grows no matter what.. and that takes more and more money that we don't have. Keeps adding zeroes to that debt, and hope that other countries we have a trade deficit with continue to trade us their goods. What could go wrong?"
