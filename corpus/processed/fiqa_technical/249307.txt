Working many hours is not uncommon. When I worked at Fidelity the first half of the month was about 40+, by the second half of the month it was easily 50+. Working on Saturdays or holidays was not uncommon, it was a surprise if you were NOT there. After Fidelity I worked at the AMA for some time and their hours were very structured. I never worked a weekend while there and things were very smooth. So from my personal experience it depends on what company you are working at. Some are fast paced and demand a lot of your time, others are very structured. If you're not married go for the busy job and get as much experience as you can. If along the way you have a family find a job that can offer better structure. When you start earning a decent salary you can easily afford a dog walker, maid, etc. and you manage to balance out things pretty well. Its weird things just fall into place like that. *shrug*
