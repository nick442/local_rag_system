"You need to take an accounting course. Badly.. A ponzi scheme is when you use the capital from new members/investors to pay out returns to existing/older members. It violates the basic principles of the accounting equation by operation as investors are equity holders whom you are paying returns to using the assets procured from new investors (investors give you an asset in exchange for a share of equity). Members of a ponzi scheme are investors, not creditors. In a bank, depositors are NOT investors. Depositors give you an asset (cash) in exchange for a liability (cash+interest). > Does buying govt securities count as ""lending""? Yes. If you purchase a bond, you're lending money to the issuer."
