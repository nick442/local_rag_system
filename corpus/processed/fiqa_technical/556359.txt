Those guys are mostly millionaire lawyers who get the medallions one way or another (not necessarily at full value) and rent them to poor taxi owners operators for $25k per month. (These guys say fuck you and pay me each month) Don't feel sorry for them. Feel happy for the taxi guys making $50k per year paying g $250k to the mad Alison holder) who can now operate without that yolk around their neck. And feel good about some greedy investor losing the making of money from corrupt business models created by incestuous government bureaucrats across North America.
