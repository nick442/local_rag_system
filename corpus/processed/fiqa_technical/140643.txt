"No. I glanced through the article you linked to. It's quite lengthy, but not compelling. I'd not lose any sleep over this.

Back to this guy - StansberryResearch.com Reviews â€“ Legit or Scam? offers a look at this company. Stansberry calls his company ""one of the largest and most recognized investment research companies in the world"" but references to his firm call it a clearinghouse for other authors newsletters.
