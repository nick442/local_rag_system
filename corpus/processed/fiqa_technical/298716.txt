"The ancient Roman's paid for things in silver. There were 2 main methods of silver production, a mine or invading a neighbor and taking their silver. Silver was in use by many of Rome's neighbors. The tribal regions didn't accept it, and the taxation method was imposed. However, the Roman's also practiced money as debt. Just as the original poster stated. Julius Caesar himself took a million pound loan to finance his ""bread and circuses"" campaign. Eventually Rome was saddled with such enormous debt that it is given as one of the possible factors in it's decline and fall. Money originated not to pay taxes, but to replace barter (http://projects.exeter.ac.uk/RDavies/arian/origins.html). Once the utility of it as paying taxes to a government became known, the forces leading to standardization and central banking develop. Taxation is a key step on the ladder toward developing a central currency--it is however not the only one."
