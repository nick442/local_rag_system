Not wholly accurate. Most fully electric cars (Leaf, Focus) have published ranges of 100 miles but real-world of about 70. Chevy Volts average 35, but have a backup generator to provide unlimited total range. Regardless, plenty far for about 3/4 of people's commutes. Also if you can charge at work, you can increase (up to doubling) the above figures.
