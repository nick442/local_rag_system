"Bieber has some very smart managers that work for him that use his social status, fan base, and money to invest in growing tech companies looking for the next ""Google."" These managers label his image on these companies and the fan base follows, thus gaining them a profit without having to work too hard to gain customers since Bieber's tweets alone are enough for advertisement."
