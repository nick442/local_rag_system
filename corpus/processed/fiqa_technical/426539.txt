When I worked with Taubman, discussions were had that specified they had to sell, buy or do major renovation to some centers every year to satify shareholders. So it could have a lot do with that situation. There will always be super high end malls in the richest areas. But if you see a Wallmart within 5 miles of your mall you can be sure your mall will close soon.
