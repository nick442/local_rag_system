"Could that be that you have been SOLD the notion that antitrust laws are a failed and discredited policy.. by those intent on protecting private cartels? (Republicans). Could it be that the enforcement arm of the government (like the SEC) have been weakened and captured by lobbyists in a revolving door between the private sector and the the government (facilitated by Democrats too)? With that said, before corporations, we had feudal lords with the same oligopoly/monopoly desires. In capitalism, unchecked greed leads to the destructive behavior of endless accumulation of resources at the expense of others.. if you start out from a competitive vantage point. This is the ""free market"" that Republicans harp on about. It is the ""freedom"" to reap your rewards without any obstacles, even if reaping your rewards means gauging customers because you have swallowed up the competition. This is what Republicans want (and what libertarians are too naive to understand). How does this environment protect the small business or how does it benefit consumers?"
