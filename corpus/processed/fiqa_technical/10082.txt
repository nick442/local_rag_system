AUD is not a great choice as it has nowhere to go against USD but down. Take a look at the 5 year graph http://au.finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=AUDUSD=X&t=5y&l=on&z=l&q=l&c= Most in Australia predict that it will eventually hover around 0.8, at which point you would have lost almost 20% of your savings. Another thing is that savings interest is taxed in Australia, so take that rate with a grain of salt. For a typical household that would be a 30% tax, at which point it is just in line with inflation, so real term growth is nil.
