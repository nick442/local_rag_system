> how it feels in your hand, how it tastes, where you buy it, what you think when you think of a product in your mind. It's exactly that kind of crap that turns me off. If I even think some numbnuts marketing type has spend day long conference room meetings trying to brainstorm what I will think when I think of the product - I want nothing to do with it. Or in short, authenticity can't be faked. Stop wasting time on that and just make a better product at a lower price.
