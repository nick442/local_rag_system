"If it's work you'd be producing specifically for this organization, that would not be deductable. Per Publication 526, Charitable Deductions, ""You can't deduct the value of your time or services, including: â€¦ The value of income lost while you work as an unpaid volunteer for a qualified organization."" On the other hand, if you were say an author of a published book or something (not specifically written for this organization), you could donate a copy of the book and probably deduct its fair market value (or perhaps only your basis, if it's your business's inventory)."
