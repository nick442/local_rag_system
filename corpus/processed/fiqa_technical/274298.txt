First of all, MLM was not made to make all members earn good money. An honest MLM is made to allow members to make SOME money using their connections - a good example is AVON, popular among students, who sell some cosmetics to their friends and make some money to repair budget. A scam MLM is made to lure naive people to buy some crap by making them believe they will get rich, and in that systems only the most successive scammers get rich. Tell your friend to forget about the virtual profit from 'recruiting' other people and concentrate only on this what he/she will earn if he/she recruits nothing and simply sell some stuff. MLM gurus love to draw trees - state clearly, that every tree has more leaves than branches. Of course, under that criteria, no MLM can make your living, but the truth is, to earn for life you need to generate volume, which is unlikely in such sales model, but you can use it to make some extra money to repair your budget.
