"> realism dictates that all creatures ARE naturally ""independent"" Correct. not all ""creatures"". I edited that to all ""humans"". And in the case of humans (and similar creatures) yes, Nature does make us ""independent"". Human beings ARE in fact independent in that they are entirely capable of leaving family/tribe, etc and moving a great distance and surviving on their own. (Say unlike Bees, which are -- by nature -- ""hive"" creatures; single bees cannot survive without the hive.) We are talking NATURE here. --- Note: I expanded my previous post with some additional comments and edits (I wasn't aware you were online and would respond so quickly), please to review the changes.. I think you will find the link to a recent post I made enlightening (or at least thought-provoking)."
