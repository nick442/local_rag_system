"I don't see how I'm biased in favor of the banks. Make no mistake, the banks are to blame for the collapse, more so than the government. However I'm acknowledging the timeline and all the major players in this game, and that includes the government. I addressed the role of banks selling risky mortgages susceptible to default, which includes predatory lending rates, highly leveraged individuals who buy investment properties, and subprime ARM loans. Thank you for providing more detail. I also addressed the securitization of risky mortgages into investment-grade debt, which could be sold to satisfy the ""Giant Pool of Money"". Plus, I addressed how the banks lowered their standards to continue the supply of mortgages. Feel free to directly cite [Paul Krugman](http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/07/cre-ative-destruction/) as the source of your argument regarding the simultaneous growth of the residential and commercial RE. Commercial RE was pulled along by residential RE and the broader market rally (commercial land is highly cyclical). Commercial RE prices rose as the market showed lower interest rates and higher land prices. So commercial RE slightly lagged the housing market."
