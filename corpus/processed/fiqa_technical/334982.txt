Hey buddy, I'm not sure what you aim is when logging into Reddit (I could fathom a guess), but I am actually here for stimulating and informative debate. This is a basic right. So with that in mind, I could be from Mars and I still would find it interesting to come by and comment in what stirs my interest. You, on the other hand, seem to thrive from ineptly trying to belittle people you know nothing about. I know that has a name, but it just escapes me..
