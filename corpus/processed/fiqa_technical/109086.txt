"So item 1 The two investors leading the suit say ""it's because we want lots of control"" and sue founder. The standard share holders want equal voting - as would I. Founder appoints two new board members to ensure this happens. Item 2 the suit: The suit is to remove the ability to appoint new board members from the founder correct? After he has appointed two new ones to implement the changes the other shareholders want correct? But somehow the suit is ""on behalf"" of the other share holders? Do I have you explanation right?"
