I predict this will go over about as successfully as any strike by workers whose skill set involves sliding packages over an automated scanner. I know these are supply chain, but it's the same difference. Wal-Mart doesn't employ one person who isn't easily replaceable. Maybe, instead of bitching that you are paid shit wages, you should ask why you ever expected to earn more after failing to acquire any skill a teenager couldn't master in a week. If you actually had a skill worth more, you'd be able to find someone who'd pay you for it. This isn't the wage Wal-Mart assigned you. You can't find anyone else who would pay you more, or you would have left. That's a reflection of what you have to offer the world.
