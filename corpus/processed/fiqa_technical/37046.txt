San Francisco needs to have the rental rate bubble pop, and it would if Bart were operating 24hrs even at 20 or 30min intervals between SF's bart stops and the stops within Oakland. It would take a lot of pressure off of SF's real estate since right now you either live in the city or pay a shit ton on transit fees on cabs/lyft/uber whenever public transit shuts down.
