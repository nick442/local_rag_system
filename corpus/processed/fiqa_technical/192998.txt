"That's not how monkeysphere as a concept works. It's a very specific concept related to the total size of our ""active"" social network, it has nothing to do with generalizing an entire business to it's CEO. The monkeysphere holds that we have a maximum number of social connections we can maintain with any relevant level of intimacy and social cohesion. It holds that unit cohesion breaks down when the organization exceeds that threshold, because members can no longer keep track of all other members as individuals. It's an excellent HR management theory, and one that's well backed, but has absolutely nothing to do with the context you're using it in."
