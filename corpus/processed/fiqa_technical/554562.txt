Tourism is down and we’re slated to lose 2 billion in the industry overall this year thanks to Trumps travel ban. We don’t have many tourists from those countries either, but the rest of the world looks at us, sees what we’re doing and is freaked the fuck out. Canada has universities that are hugely benefitting. Students don’t want to go to a country where they think they will be unwelcome. Smart people from India and China look at Trump and they make the decision that serves their interests the best. Canada is more welcoming and it doesn’t have nearly the same level racial discomfort that Trump has brought. We also get people from Japan and Korea and they hate Trump because of the tensions he has created in the region. They feel like pawns. We also get a lot of smart people from Latin America and it goes without saying that Latinos are scared of the atmosphere he has created. He is fucking shit up big time when it comes to immigration. He is making the U.S. a less desirable place to go, and it’s impacting our ability to recruit talent from around the world. That doesn’t even begin to delve into his overall anti science policies. He’s an epic disaster.
