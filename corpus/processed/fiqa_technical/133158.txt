> We're talking about low paying jobs. and if there's more applicants than jobs than why are staffing companies HUGE right now? Yeah I'm talking about low paying also. Staffing companies are huge because you can try before you buy. Understand? Your argument just fell apart. Just because there is correlation, it doesn't mean they are related. ***We have tons of illegals and even more unemployed people*** > . Because can't fill the jobs like they want. There's absolutely a ton of demand for low paying workers all around. Lets see some proof because there is no shortage in most of the country unless you're talking about the ones on farms possibly. We have an extremely high unemployment rate. > Places can't keep or find people even to stay for a month. Maybe thats because they are drug addicted losers or shitty workers. Ever thought of that? That doesn't mean there is a shortage of employees, there is a shortage of good ones > Anyone that's ever applied knows these places also end up having tons of overtime because they don't have enough help Wrong, zero evidence and its clearly wrong. No one wants to give these people benefits so they often don't even hire them as full time in any medium-large size company > Your idea is to take all three of illegals , felons and potheads out of jobs yet somehow still filll these jobs that staffing companies have been trying to fill. In LA, we have no shortage and it applies to tons of places. Throw the illegals out, they don't belong here. Felons, someone can hire them, I won't. Potheads, someone will hire them too, but I won't hire someone that comes to work high, lacks motivation, and is not happy. I want employees that want to work and want to grow. With those type of employees, not only do businesses grow and become more successful, but those employees can get promoted and do better in life. I want my employees to do well in life because to me, the good ones are family.
