You're making sense. I work in finance and I'd recommend you not listen to the people who try to scare you away from investments they don't understand. There's a little value in everything and public opinion waxes and wanes. It's smart to generally be trading against the consensus. I would say Bitcoin is riskier than the Eurodollar but safer than the Zimbabwe dollar.. Yes that is a wide range, but just go with your gut. Buy low, sell high!
