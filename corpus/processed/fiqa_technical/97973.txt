"I'm not a TJ hater. In fact, I would shop there if we had one within a 5-10 minute drive. But here's a little fact we learned studying their business model in B-school: Trader Joe's basically takes the use of high-impact marketing to a new level to get you to buy stuff that isn't all that special. Most of their inventory is actually downmarket or discounted white-label merchandise that TJ repackages, rebrands as their own, and sells to you at a huge markup. They DO have *some* very high-quality items - which they display very prominently, often sell at either cost or with very small margins, and then cross-sell the shit out of you with the rest of their ""regular"" super high-margin stuff. This gives the customer the impression that they're buying something premium at a pretty good price. TJ also adopted Whole Foods' marketing techniques, like displaying their ""fresh"" cut flowers right up front in wholesome-looking baskets, even though those flowers are probably several days old. They also take advantage of a big, very well managed national supply chain to cut costs even further. They also have excellent customer service and the best pumpkin ice cream I have ever tasted (seriously, check it out). Great business. But they're a premium upmarket chain that wishes to stay there. Their business model would never work for a traditional national chain like Kroger, Harris Teeter or Dominick's."
