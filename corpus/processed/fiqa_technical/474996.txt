"You're mixing up rhetoric (aka discussion and argument) with dialectic (the ""logical"" search for absolute truth). No essay about business could possibly be dialectic. Mine isn't. Paul Graham's certainly aren't. Therefore they are rhetoric, discussion and argument. And ""This person has much to gain if you do what he says"" is an absolutely valid argument. BTW - I'm self-taught. If you want to learn more, I highly recommend ""Thank You For Arguing."""
