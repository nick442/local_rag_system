http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/lookout/average-american-commute-25-1-minutes-165915472.html Average commute is 50 minutes each day, which means you are already at the edge for your average driver. I wouldn't say the vast amount of people can commute, but a sizeable portion can. The problem still is that even with high gas prices buying a cheap car is much cheaper than an electric. You can buy a Chevy Spark that gets 38MPG for $13,000, compared to electric vehicles that start in the 30s.
