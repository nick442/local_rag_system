RICO charges merely need evidence of a conspiracy from the higher-ups to direct illegal actions to the lower ones. >The RICO Act focuses specifically on racketeering, and it allows for the leaders of a syndicate to be tried for the crimes which they ordered others to do or assisted them, closing a perceived loophole that allowed someone who told a man to, for example, murder, to be exempt from the trial because they did not actually do it. I'm waiting for a direction document with Jamie Dimon's signature and a attorney general with a set of balls.
