What? I think you're really confused. ~1946 - ~1964 is the Baby Boomers. All of the policies that were put in place that led up to first the .COM bubble and then the housing bubble, took place in the late 80s and through the 90s. Most of Gen X was somewhere between their late 20s/early 30s (for the oldest) and elementary school (for the youngest, born in 81/82). The small percentage of that group that was even out of school during those years was very likely in their first few years on the job. Even while the events eventually transpired (2000-2008), most of Gen X was still either in school, or in their first few years on the job (the very oldest of them was around 40, and finally at a point where they could start being considered as middle-managers). Only now, in 2012, are we finally starting to see the bulk of the power starting to shift, as the Baby Boomers finally begin to retire, and Gen X starts taking their place. In all actuality, the collapse in 2008 could turn out to be the line in the sand where the Boomer rule ended, and Gen X took over. In 15 years, if things have gotten worse, then we can all get back together and blame Gen X..but as far as the mess we're in currently? That's the Boomers.
