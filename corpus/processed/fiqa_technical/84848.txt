Good. The quality of programming on TV seems to decrease year after year. In an effort to combat people ignoring advertisements the shows now contain horrendous [product placement](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQYwFND7rHE) filler, which is barely [disguised anymore](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfHuZ5qrYX4), and the comedy becomes weaker and weaker as shows like Two and a Half Men go on and on, replaying the same tired plots, refusing to die, as yet more unfunny filler appears, e.g. Mike and Molly. TV is dying not only because people like the freedom of the internet, but also because people don't like shit. You get 500 channels of cable, 10 of them are watchable. Those ten are only watchable between 7 and 12 at night, if even then. Why is TV failing? Because TV sucks.
