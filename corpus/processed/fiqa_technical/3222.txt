This depends in part on where you are. Sometimes signing over the title is all it takes to transfer ownership, sometimes more is involved. Contact your local department of motor vehicles (or equivalent) and ask them about how to transfer ownership, about registration (probably NOT transferrable), about license plates (you may need new ones), and about when the next inspection will be due (here, I think they gave me a grace period of one month to complete that even though it had been inspected for the previous owner two months earlier).
