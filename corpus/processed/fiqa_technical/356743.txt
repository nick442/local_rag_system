> but we as a society do not even offer enough college courses to let people learn new skills. Is this part of the problem? We, as a society, seem to be fascinated by training. I know of several people who are quite capable, but feel inadequate in doing a job until what they are doing has been validated by someone else through formal training. I believe this is where KellyAnn3106's coworker was coming from when the [fit was thrown](http://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/mv6gr/it_is_not_new_to_talk_about_the_need_to_acquire/c3469nh). Learning a new skill, in her coworker's eyes, means going back to a place of training and nobody wants to go back to college once they are in an established career; not unless it is happening as part of the job on the company dime. A lot of these people grew up in a time where they were constantly reminded that college was the only way to find a job. The idea that you can learn some real marketable skills over the weekend just by playing with a hobby project would never occur to these people because to them college = job.
