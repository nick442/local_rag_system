How is that the federal reserve's fault? federal reserve's only tools are interest rates, loans, and buying/selling of bonds. To blame fed reserve for jobs is like blaming a car for not being able to fly. That's the job of an airplane. Meaning, jobs are a problem of the federal government fiscal policies, and NOT monetary policies.
