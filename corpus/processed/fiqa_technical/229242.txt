A synthetic position mimics the payout of a financial instrument. Synthetics are attractive when the liquidity/availability of an instrument is low or there is a mismatch in fees or values of the synthetic's components which could lead to arbitrage. In speculative trades, the seller of a CDS takes a positive view of the credit worthiness of the underlying security. The buyer of a CDS has a negative view of the credit of the underlying. So in this example, there is a limit on buying or shorting corporate bonds by how many bonds the company has issued, and the value you have to invest in the bond itself, so if you wanted heavy exposure to this company's credit; you would be limited by how many you could buy. Whereas with a CDS you can mimic the performance with a synthetic position; and as long as there is someone to take the other side of it, you can buy or sell however many you want and have more exposure than the debt the company issued would allow on its own. Hope that makes some sense.
