Um bad behavior? Are you a school marm? I made a decision and will pay my way out of it, but maybe someone out there wouldn’t mind helping some random person- like me- out. Someone who doesn’t use credit, ever, except for in this scenario. If you’re not gonna read the post and are just looking for someone to talk down to, I can’t take your opinion seriously, because you’re obviously just a prick. Thanks for quoting that data, you’re a lifesaver!
