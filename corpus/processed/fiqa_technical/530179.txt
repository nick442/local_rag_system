You need to get in the yellow pages pronto for emergency repair. Generally people don't call plumbers until they need one to stop a leak or fix a back-up. If he's licensed makes sure you include it in the ad along with licence number. If he's not licensed get licensed NOW! It doesn't really matter in the home repair but if you want to get commercial jobs they're not going take uncertified plumbers. Big yellow page ads in every applicable category. Call up general contractors and see if they need plumbers. Get in with landlords of apartment complexes and commercial spaces to get maintenance contracts and to be first refferal when restaurants move in.
