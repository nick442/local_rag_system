The best advice I can give you is to ignore gold right now. You really don't and can't have all the information you would need to support an argument for shorting gold. How much fiat cash have the central banks injected into the word economy? Billions? Trillions? Tens of Trillions? Maybe not much at all as the banks repay overnight? Anyway. Without going on a full on rant why would you touch gold on a short? I can understand speculating on long position based on all the news out there but I'd hesitate to be a contraian in this market. Just find a nice little company that makes money, has a good product and a pretty little balance sheet. It will take longer to research but fuck if I'm betting on a huge drop in gold any time soon. What reasons do you have to believe gold is headed for any significant slide?
