Tesla was founded in 2003. In those 14 years they have managed to build a complete car company, fight a lot of regulatory nonsense off, ship the two incredible production electric vehicles and other products, and build out a network of dealers and charging stations. That is and insane feat. So what if they missed some deadlines, that is going to happen when you consider the scale they are working at.
