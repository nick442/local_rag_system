"It's important to be frugal, save, and balance our budget. My beef is that there are so many people who say, ""CUT EVERYTHING!"" which is ridiculous. Also, research and past experience indicates that government spending can be very successful in helping to mitigate and exit a recession / depression. It's just that we didn't save enough during the good times to prepare for the bad times."
