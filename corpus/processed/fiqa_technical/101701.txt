If Trump does well, which I am 90% sure he will, then I will vote for him again. Unless (!!), the DNC fight and fix the corruption in it and a descent Democratic candidate is chosen. I give less than 10% chance for this to happen (DNC fixing itself). Hence, even if the DNC fix itself and we have a candidate like Kamala Harris (crazy far-left), I will not vote Democrats. **I would have voted for Democrat O'Mally in the last elections if was nominated. But Hillary rigged it against him and Bernie.**
