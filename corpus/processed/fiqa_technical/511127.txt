No! I care more about how accurate our information is that we are making these judgments from. You are apparently not even vetting your information. You claim the government is strengthening, protecting, and creating domestic shipping monopolies, but your sources of information are opinion tripe that don't even delve into ANY f the IMPORTANT particulars. The article just plays the blame game, and doesn't give you anything you can use as evidence in court! Vet your sources! Then maybe we can have a rational discussion. Also, pay attention to the REAL cause, not just the symptoms. Choose a solution that will actually solve the problem, not hand the keys to known thieves. It's like you have thrown rationality to the wind because you FEEL these solutions are right! And you told me I was the one feeling and not thinking!
