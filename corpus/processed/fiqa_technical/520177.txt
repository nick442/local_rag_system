Actually I think direct financial kickbacks are a minor factor in this problem. In most cases a physician makes nothing from the writing of a prescription. What does influence a physician is the never ending attempts of pharmaceutical companies to 'educate' them. This goes far beyond simple drug reps visits given that most medical conventions and a goodly number of 'continuing education' events are manufacturer sponsored. There are many hidden benefits that flow from this tactic, and few could be expressed as 'direct payoffs'. It's a race between professional ethics and marketing tactics, and at least in the USA ethics are often left in the dust. There is also another factor which may have even greater weight - the demand from patients, one's medical education/indoctrination and society in general to ''do something''. The value of literally doing nothing isn't emphasized enough in medical education; nor is it appreciated by the general public. Sometimes ''doing something'' is fairly benign. Wave your hands, prescribe a pill or engage in alternative/voodoo medicine. Most diseases will get better on their own despite the doctor's best efforts. Once more this situation is at its worst in the USA. American physicians are notoriously aggressive and are very prone to overtreatment. Given the long standing and well documented failure of the American system to measure up in terms of outcomes compared to other countries this aggression has nothing but negative empirical support in its favour. The dismal performance of US medicine isn't only because of its gross inequalities. There are other factors at play, and overtreatment is one. You won't necessarily get *better* treatment because you are either wealthy or have wonderful insurance, but you will definitely get *more* treatment.
