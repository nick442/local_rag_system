Credit cards are a basic building block of a stable financial plan. By using a credit card for every purchase above, say, the price of a coffee you gain a number of material benefits. You get the free use of the bank's money for about a month. You reduce the amount of cash you require to almost nothing. You get a handy budget tracking tool as many credit cards help you assign categories to expenses. You can typically download your transactions and import them into a budget app for handy record keeping. Many cards offer benefits such as extended warranties on items purchased, travel insurance, reward points and other benefits. There is only one caveat: Pay the entire balance, in full, every month, on or before the due date. Don't even THINK about paying anything less and don't EVER be late.
