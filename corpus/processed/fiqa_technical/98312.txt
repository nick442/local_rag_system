It was everyone, from the bankers, to the no doc loan officers, to the people with no or minuscule incomes applying for a home they knew they could not afford, to the people who used their home as a piggy bank, to house flippers, to speculators, to investors. Everyone has some blame, greed, what ever you want to call it. There was no one person to shoulder the blame.
