Tax revenues are spent mostly by voter referendum. If you can't vote, your taxes are spent by your neighbors. In our district ALL of the other schools have reduced enrollment so ALL the neighborhoods that can vote are happy with the performance of the school board and their situations. So the neighborhood that can't vote has the overcrowded school. They say that IF the levy is passed they will have a new school by 2017. Of course, my children will be out of the school by then, so good for them.
