Jesus you're impossibly dense. >I know that the Port Authority employees don't work for the city, so that's a straw man. Then why did you write the quote below? What is the point of bringing up city workers that are not involved in the article unless you believe that the cops in the article are city workers? The only other reason would be to mislead the reader. >Presidential and statewide elections have no bearing on employment contracts for city workers. . >The reason you've been disingenuous is because you implied that the fact that New York City is overwhelmingly Democratic has any bearing over the control of the New York State Legislature, or the Governorship, when this is clearly not the case. Are you serious? NYC has 8mm of the 19mm NY state residents. This equates to almost half of the votes in statewide races, not to mention the majority of the political funding. This has a large bearing on who gets elected to statewide office. >Even so, the current state of the Port Authority was shaped by more than the past 5 years, and to imply otherwise is also disingenuous. To imply that the executive director for the last 5 years should shoulder some of the blame is disingenuous? Who is to blame then? The last executive director, Anthony Shorris was also appointed by a democrat. You're going to have to do a lot of lying and reaching to falsely blame this on a republican. You've clearly made up your mind without knowing any of the facts, and are too stubborn to learn from reality. Pretty sad. You also seem to have a very high standard for other people's posts while you outright lie in yours.
