Of course there's nobody selling houses because everybody and their mother is renting them out and using Airbnb to make every room or floor into another source of income. And when large corporations are doing the same, nobody is selling, then who is buying? Well whoever can afford it as prices go up and as urban areas grow. Meanwhile interest rates are high and possibly going higher making it difficult for anybody to get in without large amounts of cash. Who will have this cash? People who make money on their current real estate, who are currently renting them out, and want to buy more to rent out.
