it's not that i suggest those areas of finance instead, its that those are areas of finance and most consulting isn't finance. in consulting you'd have a 'financial services' alignment where you do bitch work for a goldman or a bank of america. do you view that as finance consulting? if you want to do modeling or valuation or asset allocation, go straight to that type of job. you'll be hard pressed to find it in consulting (not saying you won't, just hard)
