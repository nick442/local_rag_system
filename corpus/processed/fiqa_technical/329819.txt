"It would be incredibly unusual for the same institution to offer checking and savings accounts with exactly the same features/benefits (including interest, etc). The reason is that (in the USA, anyways) the Fed makes banks keep a certain percentage of their total assets (called the reserve requirement) ""in house."" Checking account deposits cannot be re-loaned 100%--some of the money you put in your checking account must be held by the bank in its vaults. Savings accounts are not limited in this way. So logic dictates that if depositing into one type of account is better for the bank than the other (ie, they can use more of the money to make money), they will reward people for using the one that is more beneficial to their bottom line. I'm recalling this from college finance 101, so I may be slightly mis-remembering things, but I'm 99.99% sure that this is the primary reason you see checking accounts with lower interest rates--banks would prefer you to use savings accounts, and set up incentives so that you will. Sorry, I know this doesn't really answer your question, but I think it may help you understand your options a little better (I hope!)"
