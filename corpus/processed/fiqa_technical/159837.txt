Essentially, this article points to having the Fed, ie taxpayers run a bank. First, it's not what the PO is and is chartered to do. All the pols have screwed the pooch by laying on rules and benefit mandates to make the USPS almost unworkable. The Feds are incapable of pulling this off. Now if the Service acts like a front/kiosk for pay for a bank without putting tax dollars in risk, that's an idea.
