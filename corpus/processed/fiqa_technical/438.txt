Best job you could get was working for the government. Pension isn't as good now, but they still have one. And your healthcare is covered. Sacrifice some money while working to pay into those things. Won't be rich, but you'll be far from poor. And can live a satisfying life even if you are sole income for household. If you have a spouse that works, you are fucking set.
