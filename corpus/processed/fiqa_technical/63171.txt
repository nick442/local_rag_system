See the problem is it's very hard to see how they can leave or ask to leave. There's very little on this in the treaties. They can't be kicked out under any treaty to the best of my knowledge. The only way I can see them getting kicked out is that they are cut off from Target 2, forced to print money/introduce capital controls etc, that breaks the laws of loads of treaties and they then get kicked out of not just the Euro but also the EU. It's all so incredibly messy.
