"Well.. to be fair.. everyone can make a plan for their lives. Of course, life happens and it can derail that plan. With a plan, you can at least know you're making decisions that help propel you towards your goals. Without a plan, you're just rudderless. Planning doesn't cost anything. Making goals doesn't cost anything. With that being said, the less ""means"" that a person has, the harder it is to live below them. It really comes down to individual circumstances."
