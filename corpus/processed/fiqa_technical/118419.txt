> Word to the wise, don't take on debt to basically launch your business. Can confirm. Was bankruptcy attorney for small business in Ch 11, and have heard recordings of some of its lenders (a family, actually) making not-so-subtle threats on the lives/safety of some of the company's principals. And the background of these guys told me they weren't bluffing. Just because some prospective lenders appear legit and even own sizable companies, it doesn't mean they're not willing to take less-than-legal routes to collect.
