"once again: the problems you have commented about (i.e. decline of UK manufacturing and foreign policy) and your very crude version of historical causality, combined with the policy conclusions you have suggested (the need for common immigration and policy regime with the US) suggest to me that either you haven't quite grasped post-war euopean history, or you've ventured into the realm of conspiracy theory. PS: ""when they're charismatically explained in such a systematic and specific way"" is not a phrase commonly used in english. explain what you mean by that, please."
