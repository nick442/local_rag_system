The average household headed by an immigrant (legal or illegal) costs taxpayers $6,234 in federal welfare benefits, which is 41 percent higher than the $4,431 received by the average native household. At $8,251, households headed by immigrants from Central America and Mexico have the highest welfare costs of any sending region â€” 86 percent higher than the costs of native households. Illegal immigrant households cost an average of $5,692 (driven largely by the presence of U.S.-born children), while legal immigrant households cost $6,378.
