"I'm loving this thread, by the way. The answer to your question is yes: the PDE method and the martingale method lead to the same result. I think this is intuitive, since they address the same things (drift, probability, etc). Heath & Schweizer (2000) have a nice paper in the Journal of Applied Probability that shows the (fairly general) circumstances under which the two methods will always have the same result. It's titled ""Martingales versus PDEs in Finance: An Equivalence Result with Examples"". My argument is that Black-Scholes is really an equilibrium model, not an arbitrage-free model. Despite that, I'm claiming that it is possible to use BS (and any other equilibrium model) in a no-arbitrage manner by incorporating information from other securities, but that this doesn't make the underlying model and its assumptions a no-arbitrage model. I think, basically, what I'm trying to say is that I don't think market completeness is really the issue, but rather that the issue is the difference between the model and reality. Equilibrium models make a statement about what reality *should* be, given some parameters that you're supposed to know with certainty (all bets are off if you have to estimate them). Arbitrage-free models explicitly use external, observed prices, *but do not explain why we observe those prices*. In this context (and using these definitions), I'd say Black-Scholes is clearly an equilibrium model, albeit one built from some arguments that involve arbitrage."
