I am a junior analyst at a fund of funds. I spend most of my time working on streamlining our process by helping one of the senior analysts create new models to replace our spreadsheets. I work during the summer since I am a student. The rest of my time in the office I simply research managers that we are looking into for the PM's and senior analysts. You definitely want good excel skills as an analyst. Coding is also a good skill to have depending on what sort of role you play.
