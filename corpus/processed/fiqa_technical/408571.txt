In 1997, the late David Bowie famously worked with a financier to innovate on a bond issue to be paid back by the royalties on his back catalog, Bowie Bonds Several contemporary musicians followed suit, but Madonna was not one of them. At some point this may change and Madonna or the label that owns part of the catalog may issue bonds backed by royalties. Madonna's catalog pre-2007 is owned by Warner Music which in 2011 was sold by Time-Warner to a private equity company Access Industries. Madonna's post 2007 music including the latest 2015 release is in partnership with LiveNation, a publicly traded company LYV.
