They're digitized now too on what's called an ECDIS (electronic chart display information system) that automatically updates but an actual ECDIS is expensive. There are plenty of other plotters and iPad programs and stuff that are available that can be updated as well but they're not approved for commercial navigation. A lot of professionals still use them though because they're handy and more intuitive.
