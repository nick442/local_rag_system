The trigger for a Currency Transaction Report is over $10K (spending or winning). Casinos are required by law to file a CTR above that level. You can walk away from a casino with your chips, but that will draw scrutiny from security and AML folks who are tracking them. If they think you are acting suspiciously they will file a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR). Both CTRs and SARs are required by the IRS.
