>It sounds like you might not be in the target demographic for the service, but that doesn't mean there is no market for it. I agree 100%. I wasn't saying it was a dumb business to continue growing. Just giving my own dumb opinions concerning my own dumb situation. The disabled sisters across the way get Peapod (a grocery delivery service) regularly. My sister and brother-in-law (who have kids like you mentioned) use Amazon Now (or something like it) already and appreciate not having to make as many grocery trips. As far as specific items, I'd just worry about the store being out. It isn't uncommon for us to get groceries from three (or more) different stores in a given weekend. Again, we're not the target market.
