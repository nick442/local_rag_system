Microsoft is in far deeper trouble than most people realize, especially Wall Street. * Windows Phone - nearly dead * Windows 8 - fiasco * Azure - the poor step child to AWS with beta functionality that lasts forrrrrrrrever * Bing - they lose billions of dollars a year on this. Time to sh*t or get off the pot. * Office - a shiny new coat on the outside every few years but under the hood, it's the textbook definition of spaghetti code. * Internet Explorer - when you try and take victory laps on reddit because your browser FINALLY complies with standards after all of these years, you should just shut up about it. * They have poured billions into buying companies where the end result is basically wasted money. They bought Skype a few years ago and they still have not built out a fully functional Windows 8 version of the app. If you want to delete your Skype account, they literally tell you that it can't be deleted but instead to edit your profile to a bunch of gibberish and save it. WTF is that? Whomever is in charge should be fired. As someone who has worked with MS for 2 decades, the past few years has just been an embarrassment. Their employees act like fading movie stars who can only remember their glory from 20 years ago while the movies they make today are awful. They need a substantial kick in the butt if they are to survive at anywhere near their present size. Bill Gates has sold nearly all of his shares..take that as a hint. Edit: What was I thinking? I forgot the Surface Pro 3! Pro 1 caused them to write down nearly $1 billion in inventory it sold so poorly. Pro 2 was short lived and I am not even sure what that was about. Pro 3 gets reasonable reviews but it costs **more** than a comparable Mac Air, which is no small feat. I didn't major in marketing in college but I'm pretty sure that when you're the underdog, you don't price your product higher than the market leader.
