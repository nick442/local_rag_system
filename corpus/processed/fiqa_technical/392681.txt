After all the NSA debacuhery on our privacy, I have gotten extremely paranoid about what I put onto my system. While ICQ does certainly bring back memories, I am not about to install yet another messenger on my iPhone without having some privacy assurances. Redphone on Android and Signal on iPhone seem to be a better choice. Sure, at this point it is voice only, but text will be coming this year.
