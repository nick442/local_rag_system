I'm a pretty tall person and I find taller vehicles much more comfortable, as well as practical, at least for the things I do. That being said, I just traded in my Ford truck for a (small-ish) Toyota suv. It seems like all trucks and SUVs in this market get bigger every year. Couple that with really kind of legendary longevity and reliability on some models, it's no wonder why Toyota is doing well.
