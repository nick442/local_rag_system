>If I have a 200-300 mile range EV, then the only time I ever have to worry about the inconvenience of charging up is on a cross country trip. For the other 50 weeks of the year, I don't require the convenience of a gas station, other than to buy beer. As long as you plan ahead.. a lot of people like the feeling of security they get knowing they can pop into a nearby gas station on a whim & get max range in a few minutes. Until they can do this with EVs, it will be a significant disadvantage in their eyes over gas-powered.
