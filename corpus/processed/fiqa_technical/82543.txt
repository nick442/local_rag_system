Yes, I think many of them actually do. All one has to do is look at how people responded to the [*exact same responses to Syria under Obama as well as under Trump*](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/04/gop-voters-love-same-attack-on-syria-they-hated-under-obama.html) to understand how much politics clouds people's thinking. I think there is a percent of that population who never had to buy insurance before, and are not happy with having to now. I think there is a percent who had junk insurance before which wouldn't cover anything important and are upset that there is now a standard for coverage (and conveniently ignore the fact that they would leave the taxpayer responsible for covering it because the same people who buy shoddy insurance are usually the same people who can't cover catastrophic medical bills). Then I also think that there is a percentage of them who are facing the repercussions of their state government not enacting the Medicaid expansion and not taking part in the state exchanges. I think most of them have bought the party line - hook, line, and sinker - that this is all the ACA fault and that the GOP tinkering and obstructionism has nothing to do with it.
