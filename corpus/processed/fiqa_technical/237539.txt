Because Google Fiber isn't a real threat (yet.) It takes a lot of work for Google Fiber to set up, so much so that it will realistically never be everywhere. If you've ever seen the South Park episode with the cable companies, it's exactly like that. Many small towns have one option for Internet, so those companies can charge however much they want for whatever speed they feel like giving. Also, they can give whatever service they feel like. They have a miniature monopoly in this aspect. On a national scale, this example flows forward. You have two options in many American cities; Comcast, or TWC. Many people believe these two companies (and for that matter, all companies that are major enough players to be cross-country or even in more than a handful of States) are in cahoots and have agreed to set the Internet low to make as much money as possible without being found out Now with Google Fiber, people are seeing that they can get much much better speeds, better quality service, all for roughly the same price of TWC/Comcast.
