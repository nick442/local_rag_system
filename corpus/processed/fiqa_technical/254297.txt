"> Wal-Mart already pays below market wages anyway. What they pay *is* the market wage by definition. > They are just treated worse. In which case, why don't they work for one of those other employers? > People don't choose to work for Wal-Mart vs other places, it's because Wal-Mart literally shuts down entire small towns mainstreets. In what way does that force people to work for Wal-Mart? You act like the only way to get a job is to work for them. If you do not like the job that Wal-mart offers you, there is no compulsion to accept it. > Nothing I'm talking about has anything to do with productivity, which really doesn't apply here. At the retail level, all workers are essentially the same. What, exactly, are they producing? They provide a service. They are producing the service of retail. Shelves need to be stocked, registers need to be manned, things need to be cleaned, prices need to be adjusted, etc. etc. Employees can be nicer to the customers, or faster at performing tasks, or less likely to make mistakes, or hundreds of other things. Workers are *not* essentially the same - if they were, they would tend to have the same wage. ""Production"" does not refer solely to the creation of goods. It refers to anything that results in an increase of *wealth* - in other words, it is any action that produces something of *value* to someone."
