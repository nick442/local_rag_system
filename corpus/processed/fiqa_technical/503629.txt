I run this website http://efficiencyiseverything.com/ You can probably understand why I believe I should write the articles (or at least be the editor). I just simply cant find the time to do payroll, html updates, deal with affiliates, etc.. This needs to be done every single week. The content takes serious time to develop the idea, collect the data, do the math, form a conclusion, then turn it into something most people can handle. And I release a 'quality' article every single week. No opinions, all data/math driven.
