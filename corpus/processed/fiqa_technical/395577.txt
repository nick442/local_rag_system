So would Uber change the algorithm so surges don't happen as easily, or leave things as they are an collect a cut of every increased fare? Another option would be to try and encourage drivers not to game the system, either giving them incentives to stay logged in or penalize them for logging out and back in. Then with any penalty or nerf to the algorithm would piss off drivers, and likely cause a real loss of drivers, making it easier to create surges anyways.
