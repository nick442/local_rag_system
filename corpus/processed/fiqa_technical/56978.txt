Somebody call the Waaambulance. If I was a billion dollar company that owned the world's most popular search engine, my shit would be #1 every time. I'd be stupid not to. People seem to forget, Google is not a public utility it's a business. If you walk into Walmart and want to know where you can get a good deal on a TV, they're not going to mention Best Buy first, they're going to point you to the TV department. I see absolutely nothing wrong with this.
