Right. A banker provides a product/service, whether it be liquidity or something else, for a premium. The Rothschilds, for example (I'm only familiar with them because I like their wine), are typical examples of some of the first bankers of the modern era-- they provided the ability to exchange currencies at a market value, and it made them one of the wealthiest families of the modern world. If someone doesn't like banks, then let them walk onto the NYSE and make their own investment decisions. Which is a terrible idea because it's statistically almost impossible to beat the market. If you wanted to be able to prove that you are a successful investor you would have to have higher earnings than a market portfolio every day for around 180 years, in order to have a T-statistic of about 2.0.
