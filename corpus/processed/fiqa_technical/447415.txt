I certainly think there is some truth here but a lot of those jobs have become more competitive because of schooling requirements. You don’t have to study to be electrician but It’s 2017, it will certainly give you a leg up. Everyone requires some kind of schooling. Unions are great but those dying or dead in most places. It’s nice your husband’s place offers apprenticeships because those are few and far between today. I think it’s partially true that people don’t look in the right places. I don’t think people are lazy. Then you also have to keep in mind socio-economic status. A lot of people are very poor and mildly educated and those jobs just aren’t there for them. It’s beyond a jobs problem at this point. A lot of people are studying people in grinding poverty like PTSD victims. This is why I was trying to say that I don’t really know how to fix it. A lot of people are beyond help at this point and telling them to get off their lazy ass and get a job isn’t as easy as it sounds. It’s great your husband has a union and a good job but that’s not the case for everyone. There are a lot of moving parts there. Check out a little background research on that. It brings a little more perspective. It’s complex. Edit: I’m reading that a lot of trade unions will sponsor apprenticeships which goes to my other point that unions are dead. Come to Wisconsin and try to find a union job. Good fucking luck.
