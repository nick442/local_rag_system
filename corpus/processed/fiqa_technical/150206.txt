The middle class attack continues.. Nevermind that all that tax money goes to salaries, then returns in taxes, and eventually trickles back up to the wealthy in product purchasing, interest, etc, etc. That is too long term thinking for short term America. We have forgotten that people need to have money to spend it. This just sucks more money out of the economy and [again slows the velocity of money](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2V) which is at some of the lowest levels since it was tracked. Money is being hoarded and that helps noone in a consumer economy, not even the wealthy. The check engine light is on in the American consumer economy and noone cares about fixing it or taking it in for repairs.
