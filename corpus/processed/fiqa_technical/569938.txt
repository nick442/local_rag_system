">but don't leave out the democrats as your article does I really think that saying the Democrats are somehow ""equally"" to blame would be ignoring [research](http://www.people-press.org/2011/12/15/frustration-with-congress-could-hurt-republican-incumbents/) that suggests that the public assigns a greater responsiility to Republicans than Democrats. I have heard *no* meaningful discussions about problems facing us from Republicans. But I have heard how Obama is at fault for everything wrong in this world, while telling us that we need to repeal every drop of Obamacare and financial reform (as if there was never an economics crisis or major problems with health care). All that congress is able to do these days is pander to a two year election cycle."
