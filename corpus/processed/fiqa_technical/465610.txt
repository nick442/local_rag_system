"> You give this gray topic of affordable health care that Trump promised to act upon, but has yet do anything. Sure Trump want to fix healthcare, and, yes, sure, nothing was done yet.. not because of Trump, but because of traitors in the Republican party that joined corrupt democrats. >>I am still waiting for the Wall with Mexico, but I am sure it will not be done. > Are you serious? Illegal immigration from Mexico? It's Trump fault? Is Trump against the wall and limiting immigration? I think you are now so desperate that you are getting REALLY weird with your responses. Yes, there's illegal immigration coming from Mexico, not only of Mexicans and other south and central Americans. No, nobody ever claimed it's Trump fault! Where on earth did you come up with this idea? No, Trump is not against the wall. I have the gut feeling that he won't keep his promise to build the wall, despite really wanting it. Because is good friends in the Republican party will join forces with corrupt democrats to prevent it. Now, again, for 10th time: >> **give me a specific ""instability"" or ""expense"" that Global Warming may cause. Just try..** >> **I asked you before, and I notice you did not reply: Is Trump a Nazi or alt-Right sympathizer? What ACTIONS by Trump you do not like?**"
