"A **Synthetic CDO** is the devil incarnate. From the CDS buyer (aka Insurance buyer's) point of view: if you want *protection* on some credit/debt-security/loan and **can't find a willing counterparty**, just get ""investors in a CDO"" to supply it, in small portions in mass! The poor tranche buyers won't even be aware that their **""tranche LOSS""** constitutes final full default-recovery payment on the defaulted credit to the CDS buyer. CDOs are making a come back (slowly but surely) b/c there's a lot of ""JUNK"" accumulated in the **""Levered Loan/Mezzanine Market""**. So industry finds it's favored vehicle to dispose of said junk, hiding behind two counterparties couched in different semantic cloaks: ""CDS BUYER"" on one side, and ""CDO INVESTOR"" on the other. To boot, red-meat free-market publications like WSJ then say (asif) ""O, buyers are dying for yield, there's great demand"". LOL. This completely obfuscates fact that a humble cdo investor is **entering the INSURANCE BIZ** against some very dodgy ""assets"". (would you insure stage IV cancer patients for $1mn at annual premium of, say $5000?)"
