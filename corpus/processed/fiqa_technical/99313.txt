If someone decides to sign a contract and sell something at a loss and you are the end consumer, the fact that the manufacturer is losing money doesn't give you any moral or legal right to take it for free. Nobody is saying it's right how it's done but until you are signing the contract that stipulates what you get for a movie it has nothing to do with you.
