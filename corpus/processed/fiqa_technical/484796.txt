The libertarian in me says, good. It's been eighty years. Why shouldn't Europe pay for their own defense? Why should the US be continued to be expected to be the policeman? It's a totally different place now, geopolitically, in Europe. Individual States aren't going to be marching over borders anymore. The only real concern would be Russia.. But they also know Putin has a longer leash than Hitler had. (Georgia and Crimea as examples). I'm sure someone has a counter option..
