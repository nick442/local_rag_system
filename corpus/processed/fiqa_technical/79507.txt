Yeah, Microsoft's performance review system has had some.. criticism in the past. You do get bonuses for excellent work, but in general it's a much more structured system. It's a tradeoff, though - on one hand engineers at Microsoft have a high guaranteed base pay. On the other hand, it's a very inflexible system and it doesn't reward merit as strongly as it could.
