Good question. Your assumptions are a bit off-track though. I am sure you would agree that automation will occur gradually allowing a new workforce that is equiped with relevant skills to support automation tech and operations to bubble up. This workforce will drive up consumer spending offsetting your assumption of diminishing consumer spending. The extent to which this new workforce will offset diminishing consumer spending of the workfoce being laid off is a matter of debate but one thing is certain consumer spending albeit relatively weaker or stronger will exist and businesses will continue to thrive. Another possibility is that the workforce getting laid off might be reabsorbed in other sectors of the economy or better yet some companies might re-train some of it. The assumption that _most of the jobs will be automated_ doesn't necessarily imply that automation leads to job loss. Some automation will actually drive up productivity which will increase the margin of companies. In light of this logic we can assume that employees will be paid more increasing their disposable income. The bottom line is that consumer spending is unlikely to bottom out. It might weaken or strengthen for one or two reasons but people will continue consuming and businesses will thrive.
