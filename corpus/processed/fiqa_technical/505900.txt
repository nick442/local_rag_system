While I do legitimately appreciate your sentiment, I think that in consideration of the larger context of evidently widespread corruption, it is fair to be frustrated at certain kinds of madness. There is sometimes a reason for it, and most executives are in fact highly intelligent people. But we can't help but wonder how much ill could be avoided if it weren't for some greedy or careless individuals, as the case may be.
