I get this argument for the citizenship thing too. It's being unpatriotic that I shouldn't want to file or pay taxes on money I earn oustide of the USA that stays in banks outside of the USA and won't be spent in the USA or even ever converted to dollars. Even if you don't owe anything, it's pretty much impossible to file without professional help once you get assets involved (I'm talking like a retirment account, a house, stocks, etc.. Not super rich people stuff) so no matter what you have to pay an accountant that specializes in international taxes and that's not all that cheap either. If I weren't emotionally attached to my citizenship and identity, I would have renounced already and it looks like it's getting worse with all kinds of FATCA nonsense. Thanks for the public education, US but it looks like I may have to self exclude myself from ever mvoing back because of stupid bullshit.
