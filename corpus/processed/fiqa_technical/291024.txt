"This whole thread stinks of entitlement. The reddit hivemind has gotten into its head this misguided notion that we all *deserve* to be able to borrow money from banks, credit card companies, the government and so forth to do things we want, and that if we can't pay it off - well, so what?? They're ""big guys!"" I'm a ""little guy!"" Screw them! I should get off free! You don't have to be an Ayn Rand-ite (and I'm not) to see how this kind of ""logic"" is insane. If you sign a contract, you have to honor it. Period. Sure, the banks that try to sell you crazy loans are annoying, but no one's sticking a gun to your head, and it's certainly not their responsibility when you come up short. Bankruptcy is a sign that you have poorly handled your finances and/or life decisions, which is precisely why it (rightly) craters your credit score. If you can't grasp why bankruptcy has different implications, and thus is handled differently, for incorporated businesses, then **(facepalm)** you don't get it. This isn't to say that bankruptcy law, as well as consumer debt finance, couldn't be better regulated/improved. It could. But reddit loves to use this stuff as an excuse for bitching and whining about how unfair it is that we have to actually pay back student loans/mortgages/cards/etc. that we, you know, actually promised to pay back. It's fucking inane. tl;dr: Hate credit card debt? Don't accumulate it in the first place."
