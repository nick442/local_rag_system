I don't call myself a daytrader. My ideal timeframe is from a few days to a couple weeks, sometimes even longer. So swings will always be my priority, but I do daytrade futures/forex outside of regular hours and equities when I'm not doing a swing. Platform is really only important when you realize what you need from it. If you're doing plenty of tickets, commissions will play a larger role the more you trade. Some brokers are more bare-bones, some have more technology/tools. If you're just learning, you typically don't want to put on extra expenses, but as you start making money, you'll want to go with a broker that minimizes your costs while using a third party for whatever tools you need.
