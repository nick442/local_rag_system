Were your classes at a community college? If they were, community colleges in california offer a program called Academic Renewal. It generally requires you to do well (above a certain gpa) for x amount of units (24 at my community college). That way you don't have to worry about that difficult year of your life affecting your ability to transfer. Best of luck!
