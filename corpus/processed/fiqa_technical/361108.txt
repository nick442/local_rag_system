Yea, like others are saying -- it's legitimate. Just insurance. In fact, as far as derivatives go -- weather futures are probably one of the least crazy. FYI, all derivative and exotic securities are legitimate -- just a matter of price. CDS? Fine. CDOs? Yep. Even the CDO^2 -- They're all fine as long as the price is set right. A truly efficient market would shun some of these as they are too hard to untangle and understand what the real risks are. However, we don't have a truly efficient market (nor a particularly free one -- but that's another discussion).
