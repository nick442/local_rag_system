Facebook is going down hill as a site. It's constantly cluttered with ads on the news feed, and now videos. The comment sections are full of spam, fake accounts and lots pf banter. The site is way off from what it once was, it completely takes the enjoyment of being their away from users. Plus Twitter, Reddit, Snapchat and other social sites seem to be were people are turning to.
