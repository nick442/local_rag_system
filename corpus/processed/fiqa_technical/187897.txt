What you have suggested would work in Spain, Ireland, US, even Italy but not in Greece. Because the last piece of the cycle of money you outlined earlier would be that Greek economy would expand and the government would collect revenues. The problem is that public and private projects in Greece are very expensive due to strict labor laws. A good chunk of any public money would end up in bank accounts outside Greece and the resultant building would be of poor quality and little use. In summary the Greek government would be even more debt, the economy would see very little benefit, no increase in tax revenue and you would end up with a useless structure. Even if Greece hadnâ€™t joined the Euro it would either suffer from inflation or from a crisis similar to this. The global economic crisis has made the situation much worse, it is not the cause of the crisis, at least for Greece.
