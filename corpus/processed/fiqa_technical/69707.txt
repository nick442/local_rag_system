"good for fucking them. what happened to the times when people like that were respected? people used to see a Rolls Royce and say ""damn some day i want to be that successful."" People used to want to be that. now everyone sees that same rolls royce and thinks ""what an asshole, I should get the money he worked his ass off for."" as they sit on a couch, jobless, dirty, and lazy. want to change that stat? go out and get yours. dont let someone else control your time on this world. Life isnt fair. get used to it. Seize the day, go out and make your life what you want it to be."
