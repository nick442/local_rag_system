This is the thing, with EU and North America thinking sanctions on Russia are good, for the short-run they will work but Iran has been steadily making allies on their home turf, the $400 billion deal with China, now Iran and I wouldn't be surprised if they have one in the works with India. These countries don't care about sanctions, they have an economic/population crisis and they need to focus on that hence all these deals pulling through.
