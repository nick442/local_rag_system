"I have no idea where you are getting your years from. Millennials are typically defined as being born between 1980 and 1996. Gen-X ends around 1979, and the not-yet-nicknamed Generation Z (perhaps ""iGeneration"", suggested by some?) starts around 1997. Of course, there isn't full agreement on the start year, as you even quoted, but it's typically early 1980s (I've seen 1979-1982; your given start year of 1993 makes no sense). The end year is more up for debate; 1996 is very common but I've seen as early as 1995 and as late as 2000 depending on who you talk to. One common definition of Millennials is people who are too young to be Gen-X, but old enough to remember the September 11 attacks. The ""18 to 34"" range that you quoted was probably written a couple years ago, or at least from the mindset of a couple years ago when that would have been accurate. And [quoting Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennials), not that it is a definitive source: > researchers typically use the early 1980s as starting birth years and the mid-1990s to early 2000s as ending birth years"
