I'm not sure there is good data on Kiva, etc, but P2P microlending site Prosper has released their data. The default rates are evidently fairly high. For borrowers in the 'developed' world (the target audience of Prosper), other sources of credit are available (e.g. banks); one has to suspect, then, that borrowers on Prosper are considered too risky for bank loans.
