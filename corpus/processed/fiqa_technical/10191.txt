Actually it was through my own research because I despised the guy until about a month before the election. Spent hours trying to prove he was a racist pouring over every word that ever entered his mind on Twitter. Turns out the media was completely full of it. What a relief that was. I actually thought we were going to have a racist homophobic nazi for a president.
