My job didn't rely on the [EDIT] local economy. I worked in a bank that serviced nationwide loans for auto dealerships and other services. The fact that the bank owner one day decided that he wasn't making enough profit and was going to shut down the bank came as a surprise to everyone - including the bank president, it seems. So after that happened, then trying to find a job in a local economy that was tanking - yeah, it sucked. Then again, I had been living in Utah for years before, during, and after the Olympics, so that didn't factor as a variable into my work equation until after I was laid off.
