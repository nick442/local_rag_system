I have a weird size. It's somewhere between 11 add 12. To add to that I have wide feet (No Puma for me). So, I never know what size will fit me - 11, 11.5, 12 or their wide variant. 12 W is generally too big and 11 D too tight, but anything in between is a possibility. It could also be that I'm very finicky with shoe size.
