which is why I said EVs aren't as clean as they're made out to be. however, you can use land that has solar panels on it and it doesn't become radioactive, thus you don't have to build big cooling storage facilities to store them, where they have no use. edit: to my knowledge you can recycle solar panels. can't recycle used fuel rods.
