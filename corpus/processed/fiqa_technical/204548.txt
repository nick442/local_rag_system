A stunningly beautiful property in the middle of a ghetto town that is based on one thing--gambling--that is being taken out from under it at a greater rate with each passing year. You do know that three other casinos in perfectly good buildings are closing this year as well? I agree that you'd think there'd be at least SOME use for a property this nice, but I also think you underestimate just how shitty things are in Atlantic City.
