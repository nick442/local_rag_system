I agree with the culture leading to the lack of creativity, but that has nothing to do with the language. Before the current iteration of the Chinese government, the Chinese were some of the most inventive people in the world, the first to discover a ridiculously large number of technologies far before the Western world would even come close to that level of scientific advancement. In addition, I personally believe that the poetry from the more classical eras of Chinese history is mind-blowingly beautiful, in all regards equal to any Western literature you compare it to. Instead, I think the reason that the current Asian cultures have the tendency to cultivate a copycat mentality has to do with the time period when China and the surrounding countries fell behind technologically (for China this was due to them shutting out immigrants and trade altogether, I'm not as well read on the other countries' histories). When they realized that they were completely helpless against the now gunpowder friendly (and later industrialized) West, there came a massive movement to adopt the technology. And because of this 1-2 generation single-minded focus on adopting others' creations, China is now a superpower, Korea and Japan (and to a degree Taiwan) are competitive tech superpowers in the world, and we even saw one of these countries become a threat internationally that had to be shut down with nuclear armament. The cost is that for a few generations, there was no intent to create anything new, only to catch up. And I think what we see now is a follow-through of that mentality, though I like to think that that is changing.
