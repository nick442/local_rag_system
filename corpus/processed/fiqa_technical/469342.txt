"In my experience, there is one aspect of HSA's that people often overlook. In an HSA you will not have ""nice"" copays nor will co-insurance kick in until you have met the deductible (always double-check the summary of benefits, but this is a defining characteristic of HSA plans). This first-dollar responsibility is something shared by all HSAs (US gov't calls them Qualified High-deductible Health Plans). In exchange for the nice tax-benefits, the government wants HSA subscribers to pay the full amount for provided services until they meet their deductible (theory being that this will reduce the demand for unnecessary medical services). Check the summary of benefits for more specifics, but you should not be surprised to learn that this applies to Prescription Drugs as well as any doctor or hospital services (i.e. you would pay the insurer's negotiated price for prescriptions until you've paid $1500 out of pocket). And that is one area that surprises many first-time HSA subscribers."
