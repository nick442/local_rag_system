"Amazon closed down their prototype ""cashierless"" store didn't they? I mean, retail brick and mortar might be dying, but that's not because of automation. That's because we can click a button on our phones anywhere in the world and get a product within 2 days. There are probably always going to be stores for certain things: food to eat (can't automate delivery of food to your stomach, or the restaurant pampering experience), food to store (not every area has proper distribution lines to ensure quality produce), construction materials (weight and bulkiness are a factor). I don't think automation is the killer app for any of these use cases."
