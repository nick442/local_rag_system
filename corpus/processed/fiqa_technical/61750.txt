"Sorry, I can't take you and the theory seriously when the document you posted refers to ""the friendzone"" and ""Feminism"" in the first chapter. And I do know and acknowledge the terms The Friendzone is a word created by weak men who don't know how to properly handle a woman. It is a real thing, but the only one who's putting you in it is you. Feminism has become retarded with some people, sadly. The thing is, none of these things should be used in a socio-economic theory if you want to be taken seriously. It does interest me for some reason, so I'll read it in depth in the future."
