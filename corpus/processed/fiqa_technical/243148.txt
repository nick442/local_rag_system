How can you classify monarchy, empire or theocracy as even remotely meritocratic? That just makes no sense to me. Those things are pretty much the complete opposite of meritocracy. If you want to elevate humanity, we need abundance. You're right to point out that we should aim to achieve a state where everyone can afford to take risks, but what you're describing is income mobility. You are suggesting that people who are willing to work hard and contribute to the world ought to be justly rewarded for their efforts, and I agree.
