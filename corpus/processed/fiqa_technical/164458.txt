"Yeah raising taxes while devaluing the currency is a winning strategy to spur consumer spending and increase economic growth..Oh wait Japanese citizens are by and large broke (like Americans and Europeans).. so they won't be spending additional money they don't have. Oh yeah and the tax hikes only serve to eat into economic growth as it diverts existing consumption away from the greater economy towards the government. Brilliant! Abenomics was all talk and no substance from the get go when he pounded his chest about it. I just rolled my eyes as I read the article thinking this wasn't going to end well. The fact that his ""strategy"" ended up including shaming companies publicly for not giving pay raises was ridiculous. Apparently Abe is ignorant of the fact that South Korea and China among other competitors are out competing Japanese businesses.. which is a strong disincentive for them to add on additional wage costs for no reason, despite Abe's politically motivated school yard bullying."
