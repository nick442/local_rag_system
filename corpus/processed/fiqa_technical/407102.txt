London Black Cabs are acknowledged globally as the best on earth. Other than the huge cost, I have always had a very positive experience in them. So you are correct, it is not in every city on earth. I have been to 40% of countries in the world, and travel extensively for business and vacations. Taxis are almost universally awful. I have had negative experiences on every continent. As a man, I have felt threatened on occasions and realized that no one knows I am in this taxi, I can only imagine what women go through. I am no fan of how Uber is run, but the concept is here to stay. Taxis will never be able to compete with the traceability and accountability. Whether it is Uber or a competitor, that is what the world will use. The hijacked the term ride sharing, however the generally accepted definition today is an Uber type service. Typically the only people who defend taxis, either very rarely take them, or are drivers themselves.
