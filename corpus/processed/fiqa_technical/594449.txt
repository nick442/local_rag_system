>I believe he was recommended by one of the investors. Reddest of flags. >the person who invested the most (I believe they own 40%) has his wife doing the taxes and paperwork I stand corrected. >I think it was my friend who knew this manager and hired him due to a past relationship they had. That's a little better, but still not great. >For more insight, my friend actually owns another 2 bars that are quite successful, but it seems he's completely not invested in this one despite owning 30%. I'd talk to that friend, and keep nipping on his heels about it, rather than us. We're too far removed to get a good view of the situation.
