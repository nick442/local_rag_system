"You are making a mistake equating calling out hypocrisy with the implication of incorrectness. Nobody is saying he's wrong--they are pointing out hypocrisy. Listen, I don't care whether Bezos is correct. I know what's right and I don't need to hear Bezos confirming it. He has transgressed and left a lasting scar in the tech industry. Amazon's ""one-click patent"" is a household word for ""dirty"" and ""predatory"" in the tech world. Bezos needs to at the very least express regret. Better yet, he needs to denounce his earlier one-click patent as absurd, and then license it freely to everyone. Actions speak louder than words. This is why people are so dismissive of his arguments. He is right, but many of us will never take him seriously."
