"They're certainly a factor. Am I misunderstanding your comment? The only way it seems to parse is if you're saying that a person who is ""earning 15K a year, no healthcare, little education, and living in poor neighborhoods ridden with theft and violence "" is not overweight, presumably for reasons at least related to the factors you gave as reasons. But I don't see any obvious negative correlation between those things and obesity, which you appeared to be trying to claim."
