Gonna have to disagree with you there. I've literally worked places where the boss talks about going on vacation to Europe all the time while most of the workforce are on food stamps because they aren't paid a fair wage. Gets pretty old struggling to eat while the ones at the top are being propped up by stolen wages. People talk about tax being theft when I'd argue it's the ones at the top taking an ever increasing piece of the pie who are stealing from everyone.
