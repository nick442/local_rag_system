I don’t see this area turning around anytime soon. It’s extremely poverty ridden . Plus I believe a lot of the stipulations in buying one of these $100 homes is that you rehab it and live in it. I’m not positive on the details though. Last time this area was wealthy was during the al Capone era. He had a lot of money in it. But even that was ilegal money.
