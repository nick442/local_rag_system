Attacking one another's ideas sounds perfectly normal and in fact I'd prefer to work for a company that encourages me to attack someone's bad ideas rather than sitting in silence as they do something stupid just because they have been there a year longer or have a more senior title. It's a business. Businesses need the right ideas to win. No one wins if everyone just sits quietly while bone-headed ideas get bounced around. Sending secret notes about colleagues can also be healthy if the employees are doing something bad and you fear retaliation. If your boss is committing fraud you probably want to be able to tell someone without them finding out and ruining you. Pushing people out because they dont meet high standards is just normal business practice. What do people expect? To just be allowed to work for Amazon indefinitely regardless of how they perform? The part about penalizing personal issues is, of course, terrifying and that's the one part of that entire paragraph that actually sounds seriously problematic.
