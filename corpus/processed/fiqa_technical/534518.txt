A CD will give you a higher rate of return. The tradeoff is you cannot access your money until the CD matures. If you need the ability to get your money, you should choose a savings account. If you won't use your money for awhile, choose a CD. Right now interest rates are so abysmal, you aren't going to get much return with either (so I would recommend against locking up your money in a CD).
