This impact, at least in the short term, should be regional to China. Once China starts churning out EV that could spill over to the west but China will likely focus on their home market due to severe smog and its threat to the economy. Elon has shown a tenacity to innovate continuously and I doubt his China plant will be used for experiments and tests for new technologies, keeping him ahead of most other manufacturers.
