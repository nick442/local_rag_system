My motivation was to see what other people thought. I know I have my own bias so I would rather see what other people thought. One of the points I took from Ferguson was that money not being used is less valuable than money being used. In that sense a bank creates real value in an economy by allocating money to people who need it at a specific moment from those who do not need it at that moment. I see so many threads and comments on reddit about how banks are purely evil institutions that have no benefit to society so I guess I just hoped to see some insight from the finance community, but also to see a discussion about banking from people with opposing opinions. Thanks!
