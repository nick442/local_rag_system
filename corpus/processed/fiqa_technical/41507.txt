"> ""ads don't work on me, I use research"". You think marketers don't know that and influence that? Yep. What research are you doing, reading reviews? What's the motivation of the reviewer? Did they get paid for it? Are they an affiliate for the company? Did they receive the product free in order to review it? How did you even end up on that particular reviewer's page? Did you google them? Did you click an ad result? Ever since Google made the differentiation between ad results and organic less noticeable (and put 4 ads on highly competitive keywords, thus dropping the first organic result below the fold) the CTR on ads vs. organic has been quite a bit higher. There are so many factors, and people that think they're immune to ads strike me as a bit naive."
