I stopped going to Applebee’s the same reason I stopped going to Chili’s and Red Robin. The stupid tablets they added. They all added tablets to the table which meant the waiters vanished. I go out to eat to be served, and have a nice experience, not to tap out my own order and tap out my own payment info on some grimey shitty tablet that others have been smearing their fingers on all day long, and then wait forever for drink refills because they have no reason to check on you regularly. At that rate I could go do the same thing at mcdonalds for half the price.
