Who would lose their jobs? Sure some jobs that can only exist at $7 an hour would disappear, but when the lower and middle class hav emore disposable income, consumer spending would go up, creating jobs in other areas. Basically you would take money from the rich to put it in the hands of people who spend the money, stimulating the economy. This increases the prosperity of the nation.
