"Can everybody just sit back and grasp the concepts flying around this topic for a moment? The *federal government* wants to tell broadcasting networks what kind of compression chain to use for their commercials. How the flying fuck does one *comply* with this kind of regulation? Will networks need to abandon hard-limiting compressors in favor of volume normalization? (Meaning: the government will require networks to favor one brand of compression product, creating an unfair competitive disadvantage for those companies who make simpler, more reliable compression gear sans the algorithmic audio ducking engines). What constitutes a breach of said regulation? How does the federal government measure compliance? If anybody could provide a source for the actual regulations from the FCC itself, that would be great. We should really be picking *that* apart as opposed to the dumbed-down ""Today Show"" version of the regulation. But right now, I see no way to combat the claim that this is a fucking idiotic and completely impractical legislation that no networks will actually comply with. There's just no way, from my experience as a audio broadcasting engineer, that this can be enforced. If networks *do comply* voluntarily, it will end up being an enormous burden, both cost-wise and logistically, to implement effectively. This seems like a gradual step towards regulating the dynamic levels on the side of the commercial developers themselves. After the voting public forgets that the FCC implemented this regulation, they're going to say: now that this is a matter of the federal government, we *need* to control the commercial producers themselves because the previous efforts failed."
