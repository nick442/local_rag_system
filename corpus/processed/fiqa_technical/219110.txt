I never said they're not going to change. I'm saying it will take far more than a year or two. The article say that a $10/barrel can happen in 2 years. I'm saying no. And it's not inefficiency that's causing expensive electricity. Philippines does not have the basic requirements to create cheap and renewable energy to supply what it needs. Nowhere to build a dam for hydro power. And too many strong typhoons/earthquakes for building wind. Solar power would not necessarily work either. The nation is one of the most biodiverse areas in the world. By blocking large chunks of the islands and depriving the land of sunlight, you are causing massive environmental destruction. Palm and agriculture has already devastated many parts of Philippines, what it needs is more vegetation. Tidal power isn't nearly as developed as the other forms of new energy. And it may also disrupt a very busy marine trade route.
