One thing I've always done is purchase things only through Amazon. And when I feel the need to buy something, I add it to my shopping cart, but not checkout. I do my best to always wait at least a few days before going through checkout. Adding it to my cart fills the need in my head for owning that thing. I've found if I wait a few days, my need to own it goes away enough so that I often end up not buying it.
