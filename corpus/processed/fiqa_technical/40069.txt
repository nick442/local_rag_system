How long will that transition take? And why did you get into construction? I ask because I'm curious about how geography, the number of jobs in your area in that particular field, your perception of job options, why you chose that occupation at the time, and how long you expect your transition from one job to another to take. Those things factor into other arguments going on about this article and I'm curious how that information relates to myself and others. You mentioned CC debt as building the trade deficit and that isn't entirely true, at least from what I've read about the deficit. The deficit is a symptom/outcome of some of which you know, but the decisions businesses make to outsource doesn't just add to that, but builds a skill deficit. Manufacturing is a good example of businesses outsourced and that skill seeing less and less entry level work due to it, which inhibits choice of income. As for wages, a lot of countries have minimum wage laws, but to suggest one or another is disastrous for an entire country ignores a variety of economic factors that lead to a crap economy.
