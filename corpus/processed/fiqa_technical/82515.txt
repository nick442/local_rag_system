We got a diaper shipment as a baby shower gift. I thought it would be a bunch of crap but I was pleasantly surprised. * The diapers are far better at containing blowouts than pampers or huggies, and the designs were way better than the muppets on pampers. After staring at the rugrat's butt all the time while he does stuff, it does start to matter. * the healing balm is flat-out magic. The kid has a pretty intractible case of baby eczema. Doctor says it'll clear up eventually, not much they can do apart from some nasty steroid creams that aren't worth the trouble if he's not being too bothered by it. She recommends all kinds of stuff to try and nothing works - except for this stuff. After putting some nasty zinc stuff on his diaper rashes, this balm cleared it up in under a week. * The wipes aren't as good as some other baby wipes, but they get the job done. I'd still use those in a pinch, but prefer store-bought stuff for its absorbancy. The price on the shipping made it pretty comparable. Wife has the invoices so I can't do an apples-to-apples comparison, but she said for the diapers alone it's maybe a 2-cent markup per diaper, including shipping costs.
