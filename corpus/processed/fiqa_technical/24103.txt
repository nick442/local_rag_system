I'm not a financial guy, but I handle decent amounts of money. I don't care how much money you take in, money only makes so much money. Sure, $1 million throws off decent interest (at least it used to), but it doesn't generate enough money to ever sustain a Ponzi scheme. Don't be fooled by what $20 million generates everyday in an account. It's never enough to pay back investors a fair return on their money.
