A bit anecdotal, but I once studied Erasmus and one of my buddies was from France. Long story short, he was to be paid a monthly stipend for living/studying expenses from the French gov't (very typical for Erasmus/study abroad in Europe). He didn't receive his FIRST check until about 4 months after he had returned to France (~10 months later than expected).
