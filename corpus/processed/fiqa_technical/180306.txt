"Queuing for service also occurs in the US.. except that position in the queue is determined by wealth (i.e. US care is rationed based on the amount of money in your pocket).

Queuing in Canada is based on medical need (those in the most dire need are treated first). Beyond that, the other choke point is available resources (eg. not enough orthopedic surgeons)."
