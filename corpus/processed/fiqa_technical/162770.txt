FYI, it's not my article. But to respond.. > What if it contributed to a planet that did not get destroyed, thereby maintaining a better business climate (pun intended) for the future?* FTFY The point being made is that it isn't the purpose of a business to contribute to a planet not getting destroyed. That is the purpose of a scientist/non-profit/governmental organization. The point being made is that a business is losing its true focus and thus undermining its purpose if it tries to do anything other than maximize profits. I'm NOT saying I agree with that, but that's my take on what they're saying.
