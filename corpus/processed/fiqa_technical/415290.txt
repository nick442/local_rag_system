Went to UCSB and graduated in 2011. It's a good school, but if you are in economics (was business economics, but recently changed) you are severely under prepared for finance. Like slfk.. said you really need the internships/experience with excel to be functional in the industry. In my interviews (analyst level) it was my internship in a completely different industry that I worked while in my final quarter at UCSB that set myself apart. One of the things I did there ended up being very similar to a key aspect of what they do. I had just internship experience, no job prior and was chosen over people with 2-3 years of experience. That being said having an internship that is just for the resume will not help you. You need to try to make sure the internship isn't a paper pushing one and that they are truly giving you work that will advance your skills/ something you are interested in. It will also help you in the interview process if you like what you do because it will flow more naturally than if you are making stuff up on the spot. Lastly, I want to emphasize NETWORK. This is the most important thing you can do. You need to take any advantage you have and run with it. If you exhausted all avenues through networking, try to speak with someone. This will give you a better shot than submitting a bunch of applications online. You are still early on in school and it's good you are being proactive, but make sure junior year to try and line something up or do a lot of independent work with excel. They can teach you a lot of the other stuff, but don't want to have to hassle with teaching the basics.
