We've had a Costco membership for at least 15 years and only buy a few things there: paper goods (t.p. and paper towels), laundry detergent, and the contents of food bags my wife assembles to hand out to people who look like they could use some sustenance -- peanuts, Slim Jims, granola bars, peanut-butter crackers, etc. We shop there *maybe* twice a month, tops.
