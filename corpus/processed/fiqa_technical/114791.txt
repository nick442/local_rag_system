You know they take liberties to prove their points. For example, the Federal budget year runs from september to October. When Obama was elected, they use this to move the $800 billion stimulus under Bush because it was still Bush's fiscal year. However, Bush' $600 billionTARP program was repaid by the banks two years later. The repayment was put under Obama. The result was to move $1.4 trillion in obama spending to Bush. Most of this economic improvement is because of the Fed. Democratic presidents don't do anything except inhibit the economy from growth. Obama has followed this trend. We should be doing 23 times better than the 2008-2009 recession by now, but we are at only 11 times. Obama thinks helping the environment with higher energy prices and converting 1/6 the of the economy to government healthcare are more important to economic growth.
