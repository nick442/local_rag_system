You are going to miss way more work than you expect. Especially so if both parents are working. My wife and I both work and during the first couple of winters we couldn't average two weeks of uninterrupted work. You get sick, the kid gets sick, school / daycare holidays. You stay home and if you job isn't cool with it, it can be a problem.
