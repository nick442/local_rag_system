I have a little experience with this. My home state of Wisconsin was on this list until 2011. The thing to remember is that these states simply do not recognize the HSA. What this means is that there are no state income tax advantages to the account, and no state tax penalties, either. Here are the implications: When you invest in a taxable account, your broker in many cases keeps track of cost basis for you. However, when you invest inside an HSA, your HSA custodian will generally not keep track of any of this, because it is not normally needed. Therefore, you need to keep track of any cost basis yourself, and when you sell, calculate the capital gain or loss on your state return. In my opinion, the HSA is a good deal even if your state does not recognize it. The tax-free savings/investing is a great deal, even if only on your Federal taxes. The state return will be a little more complicated, but the savings you get on your federal return are worth it. In my situation, our family spends the money in the HSA on medical expenses fast enough that we don't invest it in anything other than an interest-bearing savings account. Therefore, we didn't have to worry about capital gains inside our HSA, and only had to add contributions and earnings to our state income. I am very glad that our state now recognizes the HSA.
