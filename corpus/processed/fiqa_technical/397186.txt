"Usually not the total interest, but all interest accrued and unpaid to date. This is called the ""Loan Payoff Amount"", and repays the bank their principal plus the ""true"" cost of capital on that principal since your last amortized payment (which is probably never, since you just signed the loan papers). There may also be a ""prepayment penalty"". This is something that should have been disclosed to you if it exists, but it's fairly rare in U.S. mortgages anymore. The theory is, the bank got the money they paid you at the start of the loan by selling a bond package backed by your mortgage and others of similar credit history and/or about the same time (a ""mortgage-backed security""). By turning around and paying early, you meet your obligation, but the bank is now stuck with at least 10 years of quarterly coupon payments on that bond, which they were expecting to pay using your mortgage interest. For their trouble, you would pay an additional amount that either covers their ""call price"" on the portion of the bonds used for your principal, or simply buys them the time to re-issue a new mortgage using your repaid principal to back the bond again. In the modern housing market, such a prepayment penalty is very rare, because so many lenders are willing to give you a mortgage without one, and so many buyers balk at the thought of having to pay more if they pay early; the whole point is to pay less by paying early. Just something to look up in your mortgage documentation."
