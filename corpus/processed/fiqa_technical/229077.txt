"Confused on amortization of intangibles. Let's say I'm running a DCF on a firm that has lots of valuable customer contracts. Those contracts are amortized over 10 years. The annual intangible amortization amount is pretty high. However, nowhere in their 10K do I see a correspondingly high CapEx number. Based on the footnotes, it seems that the contracts are ""cheap"" to acquire (just sales people salary) and don't have high CapEx. Fundamentally I don't understand how they can amortize something at a rate higher than its cost basis (in terms of upfront cash out the door)."
