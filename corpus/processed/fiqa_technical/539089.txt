Good Afternoon all, My first time posting in this community as I am in need of some advice or insight into Bank Of America Merrill Lynch. For my interview I have to prepare a 10 minute presentation with a further 10 minutes of questions afterwards. The presentation should consist of 3 points; 1) What do you see as BOAMLâ€™s strengths and weaknesses over its competitors 2) Why do you want to work at BOAML and why have you chosen to apply for this particular division? (The role I am applying for is a Systems Operations Analyst role) 3) What are going to be the key challenges of joining BOAML? (I have never worked in the industry before-previous experience in catering and retail). Mostly looking for advice on point one as I am finding research somewhat difficult to come buy in terms of products and services (mainly just different statistics at the moment) Any advice would be greatly appreciated!
