As in most anti-living wage editorials, there is a lot of sketchiness here. First, the workers are not minimum wage in the sense that increasing the minimum wage will not increase *their* wages. Second, the article cites that one worker claimed to be making $2 and hour less in tips *before* the law was enacted (with wages unchanged). That seems like pretty strong evidence that tipping behavior is ultimately independent of the minimum wage. Finally, the article cites studies that show that workers that rely on tips have higher poverty levels than those that don't. So, while the article appears to be an editorial opposed to increasing minimum wage, a more objective look at the evidence presented suggests that the minimum wage should be increased and that Buckwalter is either a bit of an idiot or he recognizes that, as a non-minimum wage earner, he benefits from the inequality of a lower minimum wage.
