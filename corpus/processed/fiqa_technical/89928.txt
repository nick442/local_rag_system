Sure, and I agree that self-driving cars will replace current vehicles over time. Where I disagree with people is in the claim that individuals will give up private ownership in exchange for order-up public vehicles. Many people who discuss automation try to lump in this idea of giving up private ownership as well. I don't see that happening.
