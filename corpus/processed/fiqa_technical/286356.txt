Romney does not lack intelligence, wisdom, or skill. Anyone who would claim that I would say is blinded by bias. He is very good at what he does. Unfortunately what he does is not what I believe needs to be done for the USA. I disagree with the man's ideals and beliefs, but I don't underestimate his ability.
