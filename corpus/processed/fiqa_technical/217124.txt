"Check how long you have to hold the stock after buying it. If you can sell reasonably soon and your company is reasonably stable, you're unlikely to lose and/or be taxed and/or pay enough in fees to lose more than the 30% ""free money"" they're giving you. Whether you hold it longer than the minimum time depends partly on whether you think you can better invest the money elsewhere, and partly on how you feel about having both your salary and (part of) your investments tied to the company's success? The company would like you to ""double down"" that way, in the theory that it may make you mors motivated.. but some investment councelors would advise keeping that a relatively small part of your total investments, basically for the same reasons you are always advised to diversify."
