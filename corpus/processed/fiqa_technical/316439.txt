From what little I know about statistics and behavioral finance, it appears that the “October effect” is based more on psychology than actual statistics. With that said, if you’re young you shouldn’t worry. I couldn’t care less if the market gets smacked again and drops 20%+. I’m only 31 and have plenty of time to make my money back and capitalize on depressed asset prices. If you’re older though, that’s an entirely different story and one should account for their required time horizon.
