Lifecycle costs, opportunity costs, rate of returns, net present value, internal rate of return, etc are all business terms taught to business professionals because those very ideas are a product of the business profession. Saying all bean counters don't understand the very basic principles that their craft has been built upon because you work with people who think are sub-par is a little generalizing. Like me saying that all engineers are self important assholes because I read your comment.
