The best way to get what you want is to deserve it. I like the top commenter here in how they lead off- be honest about everything. Show them you know you're new to the group and don't expect to know everything off the bat. Start getting really involved in learning the business- read some books, ask your family a million questions, and take it seriously. The more you do at the beginning, the better off your journey will be.
