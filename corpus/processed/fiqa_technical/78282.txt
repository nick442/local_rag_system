How do tax cuts for a corporation decrease available labor or increase demand for labor? I know wages are complex but what company is going to get a tax cut and say, “Ya know what, we’re not paying as much taxes so raises for everyone.”? Maybe if the company uses that money to buy stuff, there will be demand on those companies that produce those products.
