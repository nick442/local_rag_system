For being a real estate billionaire and businessman, it's ironic he's kept unusually quiet about this monumental issue. My understanding is he's had (and has) the opportunity to stop the quarterly sweep/theft with one call to his Treasury Secretary, but so far chose not to. And for someone that seems committed to reversing most anything implemented by his predecessor, it's frustrating he's not all over this.
