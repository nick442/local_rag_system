"I can't get over how many people explain these thngs like ""the boomers"" were some kind of conscious movement who collectively decided what and what not to do. ""They"" were people living life as dictated by the economic, political and sociological climate that they happened to be alive in. Speaking as a ""Millenial"", we need to stop trying to diagnose our own small slice of existence, stop whining about the incidental or circumstantial decisions that previous generations made that we can only possibly analyse with hindsight, and figure out if there's anything at all we can do to prevent the following generations from being completely fucked by our own inadvertent life choices."
