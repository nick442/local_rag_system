"I'll repeat, do you have an actual argument to contribute or just going to keep derailing? Putting the onus onto me to disprove my own argument, that's really reaching.the bigger question is why are you unable to disprove me yourself? It should be ""pretty easy"" for a true skeptic, but impossible for a believer. Which are you? You're the one trying to invalidate my argument but you have yet to give a reason why. So far none of your replies have even mentioned the website which makes me think you aren't even here to talk about it. Either give me an actual argument against my claim, or expose yourself as having zero integrity when confronted with facts you don't like."
