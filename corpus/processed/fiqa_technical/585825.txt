If the market thinks people are going to buy a lot of computers, both IBM and Intel should go up. If IBM goes up, then maybe the computer industry is going well, and you should buy Intel. On the other hand, if people start using lots of cheap commodity servers (rather than IBM's big iron), then Intel should go up and IBM should go down. Basically, people figure that *generally* what's good for IBM is good for Intel (and vice versa), so if one goes up they should buy the other. Sometimes they are right, sometimes they are wrong. That's my guess, anyway.
