"I had the same thing happen to me in late 2010. I contacted the big company's bored-sounding payroll department - after wading through the phone menu, and more than one ""all of our operators are busy, please call back later <click>"" - and told them I had this extra money. The guy in India told me that my petition would be investigated and that a ticket would be opened. I heard nothing for a couple of weeks. I followed up with payroll. They said that my petition investigation had determined that I did indeed get paid extra, and they'd be sending me a letter demanding the overpayment. I received no letter, and a month later (January 2011) I got a W-2 with the paycheck included on it. I decided that I'd spent enough of my own time and effort on it, and if they wanted it back, the ball was in their court. I changed my bank account numbers to prevent them from auto-debiting my account, and spent the money as if it was mine. I have not heard anything about it since then. From what I was able to determine, once I'd made a good-faith effort to return it, I was in the clear. And for what it's worth, it's not like you can just ""return"" it. Among other things: I certainly wasn't just going to mail the company a check and hope for the best."
