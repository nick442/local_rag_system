"An actual degree may not be necessary in 18 years as ""non-traditional"" education becomes more openly available. Sources such as Lynda.com, Coursera, MIT's OpenCourseWare, Duolingo, etc, are dramatically lowering the bar to getting a decent education. While these types of resources won't take the place of a degree, if only the ultra-wealthy can afford college in the future (at least in the States), we'll see even more jobs being taken by people from other countries, where education is free or, at least, significantly less expensive due to the lack of education and experience our own over-priced universities will cause."
