Can't say I agree with most of the replies here I'm afraid - I found the insights from books such as Who Moved My Cheese, How to win friends.., Sun Tzu, Jim Collins to be highly limited. If you need to pick up business basics there simply isn't a better book than The Personal MBA - read it cover to cover and as you come across concepts that are interesting/relevant to what you're doing, research them further. Personal MBA won't give you the depth but gives you great breadth. You asked specifically about Project Management - I found that an appreciation of the PRINCE2 methodology really helps when planning and managing projects. http://www.prince2.com/what-is-prince2 The official textbooks on Prince2 are overpriced and not as good as others available such as: http://www.amazon.co.uk/Prince2-Study-Guide-David-Hinde/dp/1119970784/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1407186842&sr=8-1&keywords=prince2+study+guide You asked specifically about marketing - but not sure exactly what marketing you're looking at. Personal MBA will give you a great grounding - I particularly like the concept of Permission Marketing explored by Seth Godin. Research how analytics is used in marketing to gain insights about and target customers (the whole growth hacking movement borrows a lot from this) and research the psychology behind marketing (I really liked Thinking Fast and Slow by Kahneman although it isn't specifically about this). This will give you a great grounding in the 'hard' and 'soft' sides of marketing. Apologies for rambling response - how it was helpful!
