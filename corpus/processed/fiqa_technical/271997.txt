Mutual funds are funds composed of financial assets and the funds of investors, and are managed by a firm, usually a large wealth management firm. They are generally accessible to anyone. Hedge funds are private investment funds with limited access, and are subject to fewer regulations. They are usually legally set up as their own firm.
