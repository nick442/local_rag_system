">Since when was welfare designed to eradicate poverty? It's supposed to provide supplies to survive when you can't afford it otherwise. ROTFLMAO. >The War on Poverty is the unofficial name for legislation first introduced by United States President Lyndon B. Johnson during his State of the Union address on January 8, 1964. This legislation was proposed by Johnson in response to a national poverty rate of around nineteen percent. The speech led the United States Congress to pass the Economic Opportunity Act, which established the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO) to administer the local application of federal funds targeted against poverty. >As a part of the Great Society, Johnson believed in expanding the government's role in education and health care **as poverty reduction strategies.** [(Source)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_Poverty) And ironically, what are the TWO fields that are now in ""crisis"" and where additional government involvement is deemed THE solution? Education & Health Care. Idiots never learn. (Shit, they can't even keep their story straight.)"
