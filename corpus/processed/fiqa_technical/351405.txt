"Online courses in one resource, although I've always found reading targeted books to be far more effective when it comes to business. My best advice on starting companies is learn how to think like those who have started the craziest/biggest/best companies. I've always gotten far more out of reading Steve Jobs' biography, Sam Walton's autobiography, John Rockefeller's biography ""Titan"", Warren Buffett's biography ""Snowball"", Howard Schulz's books on starbucks, etc. than just about any business course I've taken. These also far surpass your 'start a business with these steps' books. Although you do need to read some of those too. I'd encourage picking out a few business heroes and learning from them. Elon Musk is mine today. Check out his life story. For more targeted skills, such as learning accounting or management skills, amazon is pretty easy to navigate. **tl;dr: Learn to think like the greats before learning the skills you need**"
