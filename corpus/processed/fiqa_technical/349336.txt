Have you made the effort to even look? Don't take the argument that because the average american spends little of their money on chinese goods its ok. From your already linked and cited article. What is an average american? What about the 50% that are above average? Spending, in fact is not the issue. Jobs are. Off-shoring is talking a toll on american manufacturing. Then there are the white collar IT jobs. Free trade agreements created jobs. Where they equal to the jobs that moved out because of NAFTA? No.
