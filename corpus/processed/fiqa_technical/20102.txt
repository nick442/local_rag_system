>These people are being held below a livable standard by otherwise failed business models. Please explain who is being held down in this situation. An employment agreement is voluntary. Wages are set by supply and demand. >This country has the most profitable businesses in the world. Those jobs will be replaced, and those people will be better off. That is how markets work. So you want to violently intervene and kill off the livelihoods of people because they voluntarily work for a business you deem too unprofitable to exist? The jobs will be replaced by machines and the people whose jobs you killed now live 100% on the dole, likely forever. Most of the people affected will be minorities. I can't imagine a more heinous and racist act of economic violence. >Individuals who would rather see people toil endlessly for terrible businesses kept on life support by poor economic policy are the ones who should be ashamed. Individuals who would rather see perfectly able bodied people 100% on the dole rather than providing for themselves should be ashamed. Seriously, fuck you and fuck your violent and racist policies.
