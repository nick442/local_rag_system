That's the foundation of Limited Liability. There is a corporate veil that protects your personal assets from that of your business. The corporate veil can be pierced if you do certain stuff and thus your personal assets will get effected. This allows people to start companies and innovate more and take more risks knowing that they could not be personally liable if the business folds.
