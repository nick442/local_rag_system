"sorry mate, its not about being loyal. it's about what you negotiate. you stay with a company long enough and you'll only rack up your annual 2% pay increase and see minor raises until you're promoted to incompetence. If you really want to see healthy compensation than you need to realize it's about negotiating to your true value to the market - not just join a company and cross your fingers for the best. Frankly, if someone is willing to pay more ($$ and other benefits) then you'd do yourself and those you support a disservice not going for it. There are times when you should be less aggressive about it for the long haul, but don't forget, a company's job is to turn a profit which means getting workers to work at the lowest possible salary. And when a corporation thinks someone is ""loyal"" and won't move, then a smart company will go ahead and test that assumption. Re: entry level expectations about their true value - absolutely agree, expect entry compensation. But don't think being ""loyal"" is what changes that. Only increasing your actual value does - not just because you've been around forever."
