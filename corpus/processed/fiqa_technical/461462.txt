"Food to your door isn't the problem Amazon is looking to solve. Food to your door QUICKLY is.. One of them. Replacing UPS, USPS, DHL, FedEx, etc.. is the other. Amazon is going to take ""Howdy neighbor! Going to the store? Can you pick me up some <insert item here> for me? Here's <more money than needed> and keep the change!"" and make it a part of their business. Amazon will pay you to deliver shit for them. They've been experimenting with it for a while now (Amazon Flex). On top of that, The article has it all wrong.. The financials are just the tip of the iceberg. The Grocery store business models all rely on two things.. getting customers to go to the store and making them stay in the store as long as possible. Amazon is going to do the exact opposite; try to keep customers AWAY from the store. That will allow Amazon to reduce store traffic enough to automate the store itself. Edit: one last thing, remember that Amazon is an automation company."
