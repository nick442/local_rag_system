Your out-of-context argument is the thing with no basis in reality. Other retailers do the very things I'm talking about, all while thriving. Costco is the example that readily springs to mind. Wal-Mart already pays below market wages anyway. You think there's some slightly more skilled body of workers just itching to work at Wal-Mart, if only Wal-Mart would pay more? There might be some people who could drift between Costco, Wal-Mart, Trader Joes. what have you, but it's not like Wal-Mart workers are inherently worse. They are just treated worse. You ask why people 'choose' to work at Wal-Mart? Are you really that shortsighted? Why don't all mom and pop stores just 'choose' to lower their prices to compete with Wal-mart? Oh right, it's not feasible for them because they don't own their whole supply chain. People don't choose to work for Wal-Mart vs other places, it's because Wal-Mart literally shuts down entire small towns mainstreets. Nothing I'm talking about has anything to do with productivity, which really doesn't apply here. At the retail level, all workers are essentially the same. What, exactly, are they producing? They provide a service. You are conflating macroeconomic theory with real world business.
