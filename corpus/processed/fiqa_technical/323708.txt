It will be a mistake if it's just another game console. If you think about it, the last gameplay tech push was made by Nintendo with the Wii U.. And even that tech wasn't unique, but the had strong IP to back it up. VR currently it's still a gimmick, despite the current state of the art. The form factor hasn't changed in years. Switch is a tablet, with Nintendo IP.. If done well they would work on high end smartphones. PS4 and Xbox, same stuff. It's all about X86 or ARM, and who has right IP. In the end it will be a mini-NES like console toy, to play the old Atari titles in a raspberry pi form factor.
