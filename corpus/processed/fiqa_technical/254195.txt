I disagree, he clearly states that women will recieve equal pay and treatment for equal work. There is no discrimination there. He states that if a female employee is causing drama then they are not being an effective, productive employee. I'm sure that if he had a male employee doing the same he'd handle it equally. I see no sexism there, I just think you were trying to bash his character out of him not having the same views as you on a certain subject.
