"> PEW Research Center Social Media Report 2016 Here's [the link.](http://www.pewinternet.org/2016/11/11/social-media-update-2016/) I was looking for something this year and skipped over this one. I'd imagine these figures may have changed since the election. I don't doubt that FB overtakes the market in terms of users who have established a presence on the service. I'm just suspicious of that percentage actually representing *active* users of the service. I, for one, have an FB account but won't touch it with a 10 foot pole. I keep it open mostly as a ""phone line"" people can use to contact me if they don't have any other method of contacting me."
