Uber is not awesome - Uber is a dangerous company bent on obtaining a complete monopoly over the urban transportation market, eviscerating all competitors (including public transit) by massively subsidizing their fares using venture capital as a means of grabbing market share. Uber's model does not scale and they bleed money. The only way they will ever turn a profit is by establishing a total monopoly and extracting rent. Their corporate culture is atrocious, they ignore regulations designed to protect consumers, and they've positioned themselves as a moralistic crusader fighting the big bad taxi cartel.. which doesn't exist.
