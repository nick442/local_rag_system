So combine the UAV technology with the assertion above that the pilots only have to intervene when taking off and landing, and you get a scenario where you've got UAV pilots taking over for just those processes while the rest is automated. It's far cheaper to have one guy landing a bunch of planes all day than it would be to have a person in every cockpit.
