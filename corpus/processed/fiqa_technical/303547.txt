While the ISP capping is a crippling factor for some people, it's not really one of the main issues that streaming games would run into. You can't stream a game *and* process the graphics on the same device, so a subscription service would have to do the processing on their end just like Onlive. At the end of the day though, people don't want to have to rely on a constant internet connection in order to play (singleplayer) games. Just look at the backlash that companies have gotten literally every single time they've tried to implement an always-online DRM.
