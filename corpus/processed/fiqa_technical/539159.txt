In order to be independent, people have to be able to go to school so they can get jobs. And they need more and more knowledge to get to that level. Thats a consequence of the growth in technology. Thirty years ago, anybody who could read and write, do simple math maintain their personal hygeine, and show up for work could get a job. Now its very different. If you want to drop out of society, be my guest, move to Alaska or someplace and you wont have to deal with people. But if you live here, you have an obigation to involve yourself in society. If you don't don't blame others for outcomes you dont like, blame yourselves. I'm just telling you, we all need to engage and figure out a way to move forward, OR in a very short time, we'll be a nation of 75% unemployed people with absolutely no prospects. Most of those people will be go getters who have every desire to work, *there just wont be anything they can do which somebody will pay them for*. machines will do all of that better and cheaper, or somebody else will get the job because they paid somebody off.
