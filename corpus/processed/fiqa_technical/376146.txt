As the CEO of a company larger than most but certainly much smaller than his, I'd like to say this kind of hyperbolic bullshit is a fine example of what is wrong with discourse in this country. If you get any tax increAse at all you might as well shut down your company? My ass. Now let me be clear - I don't want to pay more taxes, and I don't mean to imply anything of the sort. But grown ass, privileged men pretending to be oppressed and acting like spoiled eight year old brats does nothing constructive. This kind of bullshit shuts down reasonable debate about the way things should be. Here's the real scoop - I would hire more people and buy more inventory and put more into capital investment if I paid less taxes, but I would also bring home more money in my pocket as well. As Americans, we have some huge financial problems, in both the public and private sectors. There are multiple potential solutions, with differing ideas being held by smart people on all sides. We should be attempting to appreciate and learn from one another to reach solutions like responsible goddam adults, not pulling douchey stunts like this to see who can get the most media attention. Secondarily, the media should be ashamed of peddling this nonsense at the expense of society. Tl;dr - fuck this guy and the media he rode in on
