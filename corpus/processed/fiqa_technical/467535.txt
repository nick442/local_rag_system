Each situation is different, but it has to do with assessing what the Company is trying to do. People always talk about WACC, but in reality, WACC is less important than figuring how how much debt a Company can support (determined by leverage and solvency statistics). Here are a few things to think about: -How stable are the Company's cash flows? (big difference between a Company that has multi-year contracts locked in place vs. variable/cyclical revenue streams; what type of Capex requirement is there?) -What is the purpose of raising the capital? (growth vs. recapitalization; where are the proceeds going?) -What collateral is available for creditors? -What does working capital look like? (is there seasonality?)
