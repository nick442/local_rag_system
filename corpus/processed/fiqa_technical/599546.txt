I'm not saying your not a hard worker but you sound like a whiner that thinks they have all the answers. It sounds like your parents want you to just do your job. I disagree with your parents 'selling' you the business. I think you should start your own business before trying to run someone else's. Your workplace is a business not a training camp, i entirely agree that you should not be training customers or employees how to use excel or google sheets. maybe a friendly YouTube link, but that's it.
