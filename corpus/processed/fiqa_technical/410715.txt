The federal government is already much smaller than it has been at any time since World War II, while our population has drastically increased. We've also already cut funding to many government programs and departments (except the military and related departments). I'm not sure we can feasibly _make_ many more cuts. I think it would be worth it to create a plan to streamline and make governmental departments more efficient, though.
