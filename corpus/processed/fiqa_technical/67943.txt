I moderate in r/finance and this is completely on the moderators. They should disallow purposefully inflammatory nonsense. This would prevent the r/politics bleed over and might help this place become bearable. The best part is that the second bullet on the sidebar is '/r/business is not the place for stories about the government's economic policies or corporate corruption' yet there are constantly links about so and so CEO fiddling with his compensation or shareholders suspecting fraud, etc.
