I'm not an importer but I sold a lot of things online and has tried a lot of methods and calculate it. In my experience, warranty almost always a good financial decision unless your marketing really sucks. You could always mark up your product against competitors with no warranty by quite a large amount. 10-20% would be quite a low estimate if you combined it with marketing and sales person, considering I sold goods with full guarantee and no question asked and only got return of less than 2% online it is actually good decision on most product (it's electronics, and we sell 300-500 pieces a day). Just make sure that the buyers have to absorb some of the cost (shipping + waiting 2 days) so you won't have a group of people bought things without actually want to follow through.
