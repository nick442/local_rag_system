What's killing the mid-priced restaurant industry? Maybe it's a combination of waitstaff and tipping. Two of the major draws of fast-casual places like Chipotle, Boston Market, Panera, etc., is (a) order at the counter and (b) enjoy a tip-free dining experience. For the price, there's hardly a discernable difference in food quality between a spaghetti dinner at Applebee's and one at Fazoli's, for example. Place your order, pay exactly what's on the register, and walk away with your food in a few minutes. There's no delay for a wait-person to pick your party's completed order from the kitchen, where three dishes languish under a heat lamp while the straggler awaits completion and plating. You want a refill on that ice tea? Thirty seconds after you've drained the dregs from your glass, you're back in your seat with a fresh drink from the fountain dispenser. When everyone is finished eating, there's no need to flag down a harried server to bring your bill, and then wait even longer for change or that little slip to sign. Just get up and walk out the door. That's tough competition.
