The house next door to the one I grew up in just sold for $45k. Just because they build bigger houses doesn't mean that you have to buy one. I'm sure my parents could have bought a much bigger house. Did you ever look into community college for core classes, I had many friends in college that go about 1/3 of their credits out of the way for about 1/4 the state college. College has always been expensive, it's nothing new. And a new car is a pretty idiot investment, a good education in an indemand field not so much. I was able to graduate debt free, but after a year of college was able to land jobs at more than 2x minimum wage. Remember, few unskilled people, mostly high school age are the ones earning minimum wage, [5.2%](http://www.bls.gov/cps/minwage2011.htm).
