Say we do fully automate all physical work, everyone could simply expand our human understanding, create art, play spectator sports, jobs that I can't even think of because there are not very important to us now but when more important concerns are met, these less important concerns, like art, become the most important. And with no jobs, how are people going to pay for all this? Oh, and it’s not France who outlawed overtime, it’s Belgium.
