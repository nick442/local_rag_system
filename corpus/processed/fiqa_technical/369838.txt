What she did with the opportunity given to her at Google was pretty amazing. You are completely underestimating what is required to grow an organization from what she started with to what she left with. I mean hell, Oracle's CFO John Kemp got his job because he happened to deliver pizza to the company. Safra Catz, Oracle's current co-CEO was a waitress prior to joining Oracle. Right place right time. Great. Look at what they did with that opportunity. > If I had the reigns of Yahoo, I would have focused on what people still go to Yahoo for - their financials. I would have built that into a major destination for investors and parlayed that into a key news hub. Financial news doesn't keep the lights on for a company the size of Yahoo. The market is too small for what they needed, and expanding in to actual financial products was way outside their core business. Have you ever run a P&L? There's a lot more to it than simply doubling down on some success that you've got today and running it in to the ground. > Instead she fucked around with blogs, acquisitions (Fiorina style), and stupid micromanaged policies. Acquisitions are a tried and true way of growing large businesses in the Bay Area that tons of companies, including Google, have done successfully. Marissa overpaid for companies that she never had a real strategy to integrate in to the company. Instead she decided to acquihire a bunch of companies and paid massive amounts for talent without a real strategy. On it's face, the blogging angle isn't a horrible strategy. She had to pivot away from search in to something else. Unfortunately she did nothing to innovate on the tumblr acquisition, and wasted a shitload of consumer value. Her leadership at Yahoo was abysmal, I'm not going to argue with you there. All I'm saying is what she did at Google was not easy and on paper, she would have been the perfect hire for the Yahoo CEO. She just fucked up everything once she got there.
