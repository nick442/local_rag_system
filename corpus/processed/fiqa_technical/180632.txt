Education is crucial as I believe strongly that every child should have as an equal a chance as the next. Food and social housing is necessary but also getting something for nothing has created a subculture in the UK where there is no desire to earn a living simply because they have it pretty good without. Community service I feel should be mandatory for people on welfare. As for healthcare I also believe this should be free. However, in the US the cost of healthcare is monstrous and more needs to be done tackle this before it can realistically offered in a meaningful way. However, the rest of government should be kept to a minimum. Military spending cut, taxes streamlined to reduce the complications of collecting it, more relaxed laws (such as legalising drugs) to make society easier to police, lobbying outlawed, campaign funding banned, massive reduction of number in government, etc.
