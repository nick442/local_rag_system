No necessarily. Do you bring any unique value to the company other than a sweaty pair of hands? Did you bring a unique skill, bring in investors, have relationships that are able to get the business off the ground, have intellectual property worth something to the business? Did you cultivate the unique seeds or strain on your own before the business started? These are all things one takes into consideration when dividng up shares in a company. The question you need to ask yourself is could someone else have provided the sweaty hands other than you? If yes, then unfortunately you provide no unique value to the business and that will be reflected in how share are portioned. I'm speaking as a co-founder in a Silicon Valley tech company. I've spent a lot of money with lawyers to understand this. You should definitely talk to a lawyer.
