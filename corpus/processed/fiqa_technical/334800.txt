If you are talking about a corporate entity, weighted average tenor refers to the average maturity of the company's bond portfolio (or all debt) from the issue date. For example, a company issues 2 bonds in 2017, one for $100 with a maturity of 2019 and one for $50 with a maturity of 2020. The weighted average tenor would be 2.33 years. These numbers are not exact, just trying to give you an illustrative example.
