I'm not a finance guy by trade, I'm an accountant, so I'm not 100% sure, but I'm going to say no. EBITDA is your accounting profit before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. So it's already free of many non-cash items, and is closer to a cash-basis measure of profit, but still includes many non-cash revenues. As far as I know, the discounting is to take the time value of money into account so you can make a decision on whether the present value of the expected future cash flows are greater than the present value of the cash outflow being asked today. If it is, then you buy. If not, then you don't.
