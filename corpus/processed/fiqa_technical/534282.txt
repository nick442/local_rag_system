Technically a hedge fund is nothing more than a private investment partnership. I was my own full time employee, with investment partners. I traded for years, and own(ed) another business which was already more than paying all my bills, so why not start a hedge fund, doing something else I loved to generate additional income, and hopefully, someday, make it to the big leagues?
