What you say is definitely true, but sadly it’s also true for literally every corporate job. Generally, you don’t need a ton of decision makers in any business (and in fact too many is usually a problem and why big firms (IBM, Microsoft, etc) react so slowly), so why not put the guys who have been in the trenches and know the business in and out at the top?
