The fed currently has interests rates pegged at all time historic lows. Why is this? To generate inflation. Our economy is currently, and has been for almost ten years, dangerously close to a deflationary spiral. Paying out pension funds will likely generate some inflation, but that is good. Taking away people's pension funds is theft. They worked for years to earn those pensions. If inflation halves the value of the dollar, getting some money is still far better than none at all. What you are asking is basically a combination of murder and theft in order to prevent something that we are trying to achieve; reasonable inflation.
