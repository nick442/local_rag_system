> I have a great idea for a business. No. You don't. >It's a new idea that hasn't been done before Seems incredibly unlikely. > I am so confident that it would be successful, I honestly don't see how it wouldn't. You have done absolutely no research, so we can dismiss your claim out of hand. > My close friend told me I should get my service idea patented Your friend is an idiot. It will cost you over $200,000 to get a single patent application filed, and no prior art must be available publicly. You can file a Provisional Patent Specification very cheaply, but it offers no protection. But you would be stupid even to do that, because your idea will never even make $200,000 in total. Your idea is a terrible one, and it will not work. Of that much we can be entirely sure.
