"I really don't understand. Yes, facebook overpriced their IPO. I suppose they may have to renegotiate some of their retention deals. On the other hand, they brought in significantly more capital than if they had priced the deal ""correctly"". If anything, Ebersman did a great job of getting facebook the maximum amount of capital while at the same time giving up the minimum amount of equity."
