I have a very specific MBA in sustainable business and my thoughts always go to that topic so this might be more detailed than you'd like. I think it'd be interesting to assess how the proliferation of digital communication, which manifests as much more transparency and an informed consumer base, has affected international supply chain sustainability and the response of management. Corporate Social Responsibility has grown exponentially in the last few decades. How much is that because it's a lot harder to hide bad behavior with social media allowing for more niche activism?
