"Essentially. Though, at Sam's Club and COSTCO, you'll probably get your membership revoked. By asking to see your receipt and items, you're submitting to a search and the company has no legal authority to force you to do so. Basically, every time an employee asks to see your receipt and items, they are accusing you of theft and demanding you submit to a search. No, most employees don't know the legal details about this. They also can't stop you from saying ""No, I don't submit to a search of my items"" and walking right past them. It might or might not be a big hassle. I've seen people walk right by them at Walmart. At my own grocery store, we had no legal way to restrain people who were stealing. We could yell at them, take pictures of their face, and give the evidence to police but as non-police personnel, we couldn't physically restrain them. We had a designated security guy who could do it and if he wasn't working that day, no one was getting restrained. The tiny girl working in the garden section of Walmart asking to see your receipt probably isn't private security or Walmart loss prevention. It just depends how strongly you feel about the 4th and 5th amendment. I personally get pissed that I have a 13 month old I'm carrying and then I have to put everything down, open my bags while watching my 13 month old to keep her from bolting all for an 18 year old to just draw a yellow line through my receipt after they barely glanced at my items. It's a hassle for me and unnecessary if Walmart had a loss prevention team worth a shit but they refuse to adequately staff their stores. Hell, you don't even need a good loss prevention department if you have enough employees on the floor to deter theft."
