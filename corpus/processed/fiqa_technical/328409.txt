This was a big reason for the [monopoly suit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Microsoft_Corp.). Did they (MS) come out ahead? I don't know, but I felt that OS/2 was dying anyway (IBM .. let's just say they didn't have a clue. MS knew they needed to coddle developers. IBM, well I asked about buying some developer documentation, after trying for weeks finally got a person who knew how to get some and was told that it would cost thousands of dollars. Suffice to say, didn't get far ).
