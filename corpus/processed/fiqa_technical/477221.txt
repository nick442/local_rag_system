Shopping is easy, I don't want to buy it, carry it around, store it in my home or wear it. It is just an opinion about whatever the shopping is for. When I don't want to spend the money on dining out, I just say I am broke and I will catch up next time. Since they are my friends they understand and don't get too upset. (like msemack says, if they get upset about it I don't think I would really care to spend time with them anyway) While I am a big fan or eating at home and being cheap, I also recognize that my desire to spend money and have fun can't be suppressed for too long: make a budget item for having fun and spend some of your money on a good time with your friends and family. Make a date night with your spouse or friends and control when and where you go so your can control your budget.
