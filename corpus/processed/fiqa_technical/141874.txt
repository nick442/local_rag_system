Really no different than the subprime mortgage crisis in a way, you have people who have been given lines of credit that they can just barely afford when things are going well, and then now as soon as business takes a hit for the first time they're up shit creek. I feel a bit sorry for some of the people caught up in this, I understand that some of these immigrants don't neccesarily have the means to do anything else, and many of them I'm sure don't have the intelligence/education to understand the matter fully (i.e. the 76 year old guy who didn't sell his medallion, dumb move). But at the end of the day you did it to yourself, nobody in this country is forced to take loans at gunpoint.
