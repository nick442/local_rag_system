Regardless of what you think of lawyers.. If for some reason you consider them all Satan incarnate soley due to the fact you think they all fall into the ambulance chaser, sleezy trial lawyer, or opportunistic publicity whore groupings.. (This of course ignores the scores who entered the field for the same reasons teachers and social workers do, to make the world a better place and shit. The ACLU, public defenders, those who run private practices who routinely give price breaks or simply pro bono help to those who need it- remember how many showed up at airports around the country when the Muslim ban was signed?) Anyway, take the most negitive view of lawyers possible, that's fine for this question.. How are they *possibly* worse that monolitic multinational financial institutions that have used their power and size to lobby for and pass anti consumer legislation for years. Who, well Wells Fargo last year, BOA laundering billions for the Sinola Cartel, LIBOR manipulation, the 2008 collapse.. the list is endless, just depends how deep you want to go.. I'll take all the sleezebag lawyers in the world over a cabal of institutions who are actively making life more difficult for untold millions in the unerring, devoid of morality, quest to generate fucking shareholder value.
