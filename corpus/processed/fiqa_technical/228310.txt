I travel a lot, too. 6 months living in Shanghai, 6 months in Greece, and many months of travel to various places. I love traveling! I still prefer the physical book to e-books, though, especially if going some place like Italy. In a few days I leave for Athens where I start a month long train trip around Europe (with the EUrail, which is awesome). Physical books are better for traveling IMO because you're not worried about losing them, getting water on the at the each or pool, and they're much less likely to be stolen.c If you're a very avid reader I can definitely understand bringing an e-reader, though. The books I read are pretty thick but I don't read through them that quickly (maybe an hour or two a day). Much more and is probably have to get an e-reader to carry the books I need! As far as portability goes you're completely right, the e-reader is easier. Especially something like a nook or Kindle. It's just so light and holds so much! If you buy a physical book for vacation and start reading it only to find out you hate it, you're out of luck! With an e-reader you can just change the book. With the 3G Kindle you can just download a book almost anywhere in the world!
