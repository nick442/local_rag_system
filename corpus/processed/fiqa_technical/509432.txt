"I really think the government should have a few 'elite' groups inside of each of their big divisions filled with mathematicians, statisticians, computer scientists, and experts in the fields. I'm thinking a group pursuing medicare fraud, a group pursuing SEC violations, a group pursuing DOD embezzling, etc. It's not like these criminals are especially competent, they just rely on staying under the radar. Hiring a team of 50 or 100 or whatever top notch analysts and then giving them a cut of the fraud they've exposed would go a long way toward attracting top talent in a way that is politically defensible. The SEC doesn't work because being an SEC lawyer pays about a twentieth of what being a lawyer for a hedge fund does. Imagine that same SEC lawyer getting 1% or 5% of the settlements / penalties that are levied against fraudulent companies. You could still become ""fuck you"" rich while working for the government and the US would be a lot better off."
