Everything you said deserves about a million more upvotes. On top of that, I've seen lots of GOOD, solid, could-be-successful funded companies go belly up because of micro-managing or forced hires/fires by their VC, which ripped apart the company, destroyed the product, lost customers, made everyone hate coming to work, etc. Snatching defeat from the jaws of victoryâ€¦ Like anything else, you have to be extremely careful and extremely suspicious when you give control over your baby to somebody else. Sadly few would-be founders think of slow-dating, they'll just hop into a shotgun marriage with whoever waves the largest fistfuls of cash. I wrote about this in re: cofounders, but the same applies to investors: http://unicornfree.com/2011/lets-cofound-a-baby/
