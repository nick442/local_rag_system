"Not to mention. Since I posted my comment, I've suffered from self shutdowns of my PC (started with instant shutdowns). Only restoring multiple times from multiple restore points as seemed to have solved the problem for now. I'm telling you, we are under foreign attack, and India is part of it. Also, when I'm not using my PC I shut it down and turn off the power strip access to it. Used to unplug it too. Also in the past year, my refrigerator, dryer, main TV in living room, and most recently my washer (mechanical recurring) and PC have suffered electrical failures. BEWARE those who claim to be advancing/helping you. Anyway I believe someone is sending me a message about evil in our midst. Pop culture should obviously indicate to you, if you know history as a matter of fact, not conjecture, that things are deteriorating quickly, and various nefarious factions are jockeying for position. And they are not, never have been, from the side of ""good"", though they ALL claimed to be. They punish/torment/destroy whom they deem (their whims) to be ""evil"". Though they are NEVER the arbiter of such things. Horrible things are coming to the US. Past sins. Don't complain. Find redemption, salvation as you can. Survival (personal) is not paramount. GOOD (as you see it) is. Just make sure you're not actually evil. I'm clobbered here. Though I try to reveal truth. I try to debate, initiate discourse. I am shut down, for various nebulous reasons that my accusers use commonly."
