"Based on the updated information ""I'm able to get my health insurance in full from my old job which is why still have it(ABC). Anthem Blue cross only costs me about 15 dollars a month. At my new job I work full time so I took up the healthcare because eventually I will more than likely get rid of my old one(or loose it)."" There are a couple of issues: The old company will no longer be paying for the ABC policy, you will have to cover the entire cost. The cost could be significantly m ore than $15 a month. One will be primary and one will be secondary. You will have to tell them about each other. How they will interact when one is a percentage and the other a copay will have to be investigated. Look back at all your procedures from last year, and ask how they would cover them. You will also need to see if your doctors and specialists are in both networks. This could create situations where the 2nd policy provides no coverage because you went out of their network. You could also require multiple referrals."
