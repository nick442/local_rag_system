I'm personally not sold on Facebook. It collects vast amounts of data, sure, but to what purpose? I am probably missing something. I presume they intend to monetize this data for marketing activities, but is that really *that* valuable? Large budget marketing teams already have more data about their customers than they can effectively analyze. Yet, they **still** miss with products. More data is not going to make up for the quality of personnel.
