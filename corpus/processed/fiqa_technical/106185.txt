"I agree with you most of what you're saying, but there is still the fundamental conflict at the bottom of all of this. You are saying that the public accounting firms *should* do these things, when they are in fact just businesses, which are by definition amoral. The ""public"" in ""public accounting"" is misleading here, for the firms are privately held owned organizations. Of course there are going to be reputational benefits for acting in accordance to these standards, but if they can reasonably get away with it then why wouldn't they? Edit: Your comment in regards to the inefficiency of government audits is an excellent point, though."
