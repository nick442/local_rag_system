I wish I could up vote your comment more. I think that a lot of people do not understand that kids held minimum wage jobs that paid minimum wages, but adults received more money. At some point kids stopped working as much and adults kept or took over what was traditionally a kids first job. Those first jobs like working at McDonald's were never meant to be the only job a person had.
