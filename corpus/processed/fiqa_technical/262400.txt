FedEx was founded as an airline first. So they fell into that protection. Now they are pretty much the same type of company, but UPS is unionized and FedEx is protected from that cost. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railway_Labor_Act UPS spends millions trying to get it repealed and FedEx spends millions trying to keep the exemption. It's really unfair that FedEx has this protection, but at the same time UPS own most of the market still.
