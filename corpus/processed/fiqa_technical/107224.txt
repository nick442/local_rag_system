There's no reason for a chargeback, and you might get charged a fee for invalid chargeback or even sued by the insurance company. You need to always read the contract and see what the auto-renew policy is and what the local law on the issue is. It might be that you in fact approved that charge. In any case, since they agreed to refund, and within a reasonable period of time, your chargeback will be invalid. It is likely that by the time the chargeback is even processed by the bank, the refund will be there already.
