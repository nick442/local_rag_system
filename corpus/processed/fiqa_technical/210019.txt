It's a good point to make with bot presence. For the most part Twitter is made of people, even if there are a lot of false or bot accounts. That being said I don't find it as strong a marketing channel because of the nature of Twitter at its core. If you follow 1000 people you're likely to have nearly 10,000 tweets going through your feed. It's hard to really fight for attention but you can still get decent response and views when done right. As for Instagram.. I think in the long term, just as any other social network, the lifespan of it depends on the content. As long as people are having new experiences and taking photos of them there will always be more content. That being said there are tons of accounts that pretty much post the same content. It saturates things like the explore feature because they're using less than kosher tactics to get likes. Ultimately I think policing of Instagram as they have been is the best strategy for keeping it going. Even though I'm a marketer, I'm also a Millennial with pretty typical values. Blatant advertising is annoying and intrusive when it comes to user experience and many young people today feel that way. By policing things like auto-engaging, false locations (you used to be able to just type locations like 'Follow Me') and being very keen on following through with reports of spam accounts is a good way to keep younger people on it. Unless you're paying for ads marketing on Instagram typically consists of native content that looks good on feeds and needs engagement to rise up. This is a good way to curb marketing while still maintaining a good user experience. As a side note, part of why I use Snapchat less is how they shove ads down your throat, which gets old pretty fast. Ads on snapchat pretty much ruined the platform for me personally aside from using it for communication. As long as Instagram maintains this balance based around the user and not the advertisers I think it will be going for quite some time.
