">Let the airports handle security. The last time we ""let the airports handle security"", they hired some teenagers at $7.25 to do ""security"", and some guys flew 2 planes into the WTC killing 3000+ people. You sure you want the airports to ""handle"" security again? I may not like the TSA, but the alternative (and that is the alternative; crackheads making minimum wage, because they not going to spend one fucking *dime* more than is absolutely necessary) is far worse."
