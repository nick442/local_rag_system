Monetizing loan is akin to loan money the banks don't have so they can lend money to people/state that don't have money. The ECB and the FED are theorically independant from the political power, and in pratique they more often than naught proove it (at least for the ECB), after that being independent from the financial sector they lend to.. that's another question. Rates are low not because they monetize but because they want to do so without inducing inflation.
