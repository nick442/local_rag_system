I've got an idea on this. I could be totally off base, but it's worth mentioning. When the economy collapsed a few years ago and people lost their savings, retirement, etc.. that was the best time to buy. Doesn't it make sense that the people who had the money to invest then would be reaping the greatest increases now when the market's back up?
