Siri isn't all that bad in my opinion and works well for what I need it to do. Maps, on the other hand, is complete garbage. It usually gets me to where I need to go, but feels very clumsy and uses tons of battery. The complete lack of data is another turnoff. Personally, I'd say that whoever decided to nix the Google Maps app is the bigger idiot. All that really needed to be done was integrate the turn by turn directions (rather than watching a tiny dot moving around).
