> Women entered the work force en mass. And, with twice as many potential employees the cost of labor decreased. Sorry, I'll have to disagree with this. Yes between the 60s and 80s married women started staying in the paid workforce, but this only increased the employment to population ratio from ~55% to about ~64% in 2000 ( it has since dropped down to ~58%. Also, since work that had previously been unpaid such as child minding, house cleaning, nursing of elders and food preparation increasingly became part of the paid economy, much of that extra labor was occupied in these new positions and so wouldn't have increased the overall competition for jobs. The idea that extra bodies competing for jobs would drive down the price of labor also needs to be justified. In a theoretically ideal market the actual number of players in the market doesn't influence the price. Only by assuming that the increase in supply increased the job seeker's desperation for a job do we lower the price at which they are willing to sell their labor. But why should we assume job seekers became more desperate between the 60s and the 90s when the unemployment rate was about the same in both those periods?
