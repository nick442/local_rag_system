Fair enough. The economy isn't doing so well, and employment is struggling. Still, by no stretch of the imagination do real jobs with benefits not exist anymore. Yes, unemployment and part-time status combined sum to tens of millions of people, but that number is still smaller than the number of people with full-time employment status. I feel for anybody who doesn't have a good job situation, but things will get better eventually.
