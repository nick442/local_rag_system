Got some questions related to banks and cash, specifically required reserve ratio and capital requirements. The way i understand it is, a bank is required to hold a percentage of money it has loaned to other people (required reserve ratio). Example: If the rrr is 10%; i give the bank 100k, because it is only required to hold 10% (10k) it loans 90k to my neighbour, neighbour buys a car from the dealership, the dealership banks the 90k. now the bank can loan 81k of the dealerships 90k. The bank loans to businessman who buys land worth 81k, land owner banks the 81k. So the bank received 100k from me to hold and protect, loaned 90k to bob,recieved 90k from dealership,loaned 81k to businessman, recieved 81k from land owner. 100k+90k+81k = 271k bank over time will receive another 90k from bob, and 81k from business man + interest. This all assumes there is 1 bank, and all these people put there money in the bank not keeping cash. In my native country we have no required reserve ratio, we have a capital requirement. On our central bank website it states a total capital ratio of 8%. A capital ratio is equity + (profit-money given to shareholders) / risk weighted assets. Question, how do you determine equity, profit, and risk weighted assets for a bank? is equity the cash the bank has, profit the money from fees+interest, and risk weighted assets how much money the bank has in loans?
