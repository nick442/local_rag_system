"It's been a while but I've worked with a few Indians in the past. One guy was a manager - very smart and a great guy but he micro-managed his people to death - literally checking on them multiple times an hour throughout the day. Several Americans that worked for him quit because they couldn't take it anymore although the liked him personally. Then I went to another place that used several H1B programmers and DBAs. I had to manage a few of them and learned quickly why he worked the way he did. They were all smart and hard workers but I would give the Indian workers a general task to accomplish and they would always enthusiastically say yes and disappear into their cubicles to work. I would swing by a few hours later (expecting things to be moving along or done) and would often find that if they had hit a snag, they would stop, sit, and wait for someone to come check on them for further direction. If they did in fact complete the task, they would still just sit there and wait for me to come check on them to tell me they were done. It was really crazy. I also found that even if they had no idea what I wanted, they would say ""yes"" and go back to their desk, so I had to start having them give me an overview of what they would do to solve the problem before I let them go off and start working. I assume it's a cultural thing but it drove me nuts until I learned how to keep them moving. TL;DR: Managing them was like herding cats."
