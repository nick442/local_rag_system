Wow man! Godspeed. As long as you have a plan to ultimately go grand and strictly stick to your planned timelines, I'm happy for you in all cases..however, while you are at it, do not forget to start your family and settling down as well. Keep a balance in life and don't let the life Pass by on a single track. Best wishes and regards..
