I see too often in America that when people make it, they kick the ladder out from under them. Your poor childhood explains your current pretentions and entitlement complex, but doesn't justify them. Instead of posting about how you only demand the best when going on business-sponsored trips, you should be trying to help people make it from where you were as a kid (conditions which the majority of Americans can relate to), to a confident and stable position. But you're just going around shoving your pretentions in people's faces.
