I don't see why not. Not everyone is going to be in a major sound stage, but look at people like That Guy With The Glasses group and some others. They're not rolling in dough, but some of them who are entertaining enough are getting a living off of what they do. All this really does is eliminate a middle man and put creators in more control, without the need for all the dollars. CK is an established talent, so he could afford to put in higher production values for a product. Another budding standup artist might only be able to do their garage and a camera, and charge maybe $0.50 - but if people like it enough, they'll be able to build up without the expense/hassle/control of a major label.
