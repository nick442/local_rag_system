I can assure you a lot of middle and junior managers have the CEO qualities in them. They don't get offered that job because the board is too busy offering that job to their friends and acquaintances. Middle Managers, Startup Entrepreneurs, Fantastic Engineers don't stand a chance. Friends of Friends are preferred over talent. There's enough supply of CEO Material.
