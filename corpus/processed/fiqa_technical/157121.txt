"You really don't think 7 trillion dollars is huge? BTW, There was no "" insane spending uptick"". The budget deficit numbers for the Bush years are meaningless, because the wars were ""off budget"". Use [Debt to the penny](http://www.treasurydirect.gov/NP/BPDLogin?application=np) to run the numbers. Bush added 1,438,236,760,982.61 to the debt in his last 12 months. Call it 1.43 trillion."
