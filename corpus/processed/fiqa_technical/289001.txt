[Here.](https://projects.propublica.org/bailout/) I'm pretty sick of the crying about the bailout. My libertarian friends just don't seem to grasp how much worse things would have been if we let them fail. No one seems to recall their history courses on the great depression, a bank run would probably have brought us to or knees for decades along with complete lack of trust that would have been instilled in an entire generation. Yes, the banks should have been punished, but that's a separate issue in my mind. They also should be held to higher capital requirements to ensure their ability to weather these rare events. But we need regulation BECAUSE we cannot allow them to fail and we need LARGE fines or heavy-handed indictments to enforce them rather than a slap on the wrist.
