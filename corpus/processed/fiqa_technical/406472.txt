"Good, though I don't expect the Republican Congress to let this get implemented. Mandatory arbitration and ""tort reform"" are basically just ways for companies to legal-Houdini their way out of taking responsibility for their actions. The fact that the self-declared ""party of personal responsibility"" supports things like that is the height of hypocrisy. Class-action lawsuits are not without problems. The people who were wronged often recover only a small portion of the damages they deserve, but when the government abdicates its responsibility to enforce the law, class-action lawsuits are often the only way to hold companies accountable for their misdeeds."
