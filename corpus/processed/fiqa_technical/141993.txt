I'm suggesting she be displayed and deployed in front of either the Washington Monument or Lincoln Memorial. I'm leaning toward the Lincoln Memorial but I'm open to suggestions from the focus group as well as input from a capable lighting designer. Experience in the horror genre may be useful but not nessesarily required.
