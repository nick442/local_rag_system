My understanding (which could be wrong) was that he raised the price of Daraprim (the only medication that works for some AIDS patients) by 5000% to benefit himself. It's been copycatted elsewhere in the industry, my first thought is of the EpiPen. So it seems telling of places where the system is vulnerable to exploitation, especially where manufacturers have price setting power. Edit: This was a terrible explanation on my part. It's an industry-wide issue is what I was getting at, and I worded that in the worst way possible. And I could still be wrong in my point.
