"Very good Ben, in a more simplistic form: If debt was about math only, we would not have payday lenders, 21% + credit cards, or sub-prime car loans. Yet these things are prevalent. Debt reduction is often about behavior modification. As such small wins are necessary to keep going much like a 12 step program; or, gamification as Ben pointed out. The funny thing is that if a person becomes and stays intense on a debt reduction program, interest rate ""inefficiency"" is dwarfed by extra income or increased austerity."
