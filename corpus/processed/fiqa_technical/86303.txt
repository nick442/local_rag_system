What I don't understand is why buybacks aren't benefitting the pension fund. Does it hold nothing in GE stock? If so, that seems like the kind of crap that shouldn't happen. I am not a huge fan of pensions, but having zero of the pension liabilities being tied to the success of the company funding them really grinds my gears. The interests of all major stakeholders in companies need to be aligned to the extent possible. If everyone views it as a vehicle to screw everyone else with an interest, things will ultimately go badly. That's why a lot of tech companies tie comp to company performance. Pensions should be no different in having some skin in the game.
