"It's a pretty lengthy explanation but to put it into a few bullet points: * Nuclear power produces zero carbon emissions * They take up the smallest amount of space relative to the energy produced compared to all other forms of power production * Nuclear power can utilize the existing infrastructure and provide ultra reliable, clean energy * Updating to current reactor technology largely reduces the ""radioactive waste"" problem (see fast breeder tech) * Updating to current reactor technology largely solves safety issues * Moving to next-gen MSRs (Molten-Salt Reactors) introduce a higher efficiency, ultra-safe design, with no risk of ""melt-down"" or concern about weapons conversions * Some MSRs ([such as a LFTR](https://www.nei.org/Issues-Policy/Protecting-the-Environment)) show signs of being potentially world changing and making energy ridiculously cheap with no radioactive waste That's a primer to start. :)"
