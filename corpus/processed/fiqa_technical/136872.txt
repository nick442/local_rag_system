Median household income is rising, but it is far below the level before the Great Recession, and even then, it was still stagnating. What this means is that the economy is running on stimulus, and unless median household income not only regains the level before the Great Recession but also rises at the rate before the 1970s, we are only heading for a future economic correction bigger that the Great Recession and most likely bigger than the Great Depression relatively in every way.
