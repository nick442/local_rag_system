Join LinkedIn. Become a group member of your college alumni and any groups you find that relate to the field in which you are looking. Post a message on the group boards asking for help in giving you guidance/direction. Then do a search on the people in each group to see if anyone might be in the field of work in which you are interested - message them and ask them questions or see if they can direct you to someone who can help you. Consider doing an internship, too. Foot in the door experience, plus you meet a lot of people. Good luck!
