The problem is, there often isn't anyone else to go with. Ryanair are Europe's biggest airline. They fly so many routes. A lot of the time it's your only option, unless you want a stop over somewhere. So it is the lesser of two evils, my annoyance is that I can't pay reasonable money to improve the service. One thing I think they could do, reverse priority boarding. I want to get on the plane last, have my hand luggage have guaranteed space in the plane and be first off the plane. This would have made a significant improvement to my recent flight with them. It's the waiting in uncomfortable places that makes Ryanair so shit.
