Sounds like apple is using leverage, derivatives and its balance sheet responsibly. The numbers are big because this is the largest company in the world. Obviously, they are gonna get in trouble if people stop buying iPhones, but if there core business remains healthy they will have no issue accessing capital markets to issue debt. The foreign cash holdings is actually held at bank accounts in ny or ca held in US government securities as tax law allows. If they sell government securities and use the cash they will be subject to the 35% tax. In any case the only risk I see at these levels is apple may be taking corporate credit risk it doesn't understand or can't model.. I didn't realize how big these financial operations were getting - great share!
