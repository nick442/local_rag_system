I wholeheartedly agree with this, of course there are limits, but in my experience it's not the pay that makes you truly happy. Though it certainly relieves certain day to day stress, it's mostly the people you work with that tend to make or break you liking your job. In order for me to leave my current job I'd probably have to get at least a 50% percent pay increase for me to even consider it. I will not trade my current happiness for money alone.
