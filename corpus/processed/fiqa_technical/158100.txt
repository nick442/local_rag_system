And where does that spending by the government usually end up? Right back into the economy. Putting that tax money into the hands of the wealthy means they will do what they do best - hoard it. If you have an economy that's built on a certain amount of spending by the government, then cut that off because you decrease the government's cash flow, then you have to have an equal response in terms of spending. Kansas showed that most wealthy people do not spend the money they get to keep from lower taxes. That in turn causes a strain on the economy and you end up with both fiscal woes at the state level and economic woes for businesses and individuals. That's what happened in Kansas and that's what will happen at the federal level if these tax cuts are enacted. This is fine for the wealthy - they win in this scenario. But they are the only ones who do. Instead, the tax cuts should be focused on the lower and middle classes who will actually go out and spend that money. But, as written, these tax cuts disproportionately favor the wealthy, who will not spend to help individuals and small businesses.
