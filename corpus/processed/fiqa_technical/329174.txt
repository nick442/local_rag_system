"The thing with advancing technology is that cameras have become cheaper and everybody has computers. Teenagers know how to use photoshop. So I don't see the pressure on photographers going away any time soon. It's like the porno industry that is getting squeezed because everybody who has a camera and a computer can make one. The professional quality is better. But the amatuer quality products have caught up to the point where it can start competing. Some people are happy with being able to say ""I took a photo for the cover of Time""."
