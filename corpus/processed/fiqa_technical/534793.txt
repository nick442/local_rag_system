This is complete bullshit. To imply a grand conspiracy amongst the upper middle class to construct a barrier to the rest of the middle class' ability to move up is ludicrous. Does the author think there are clandestine meetings where zoning rules and sandwich ingredients are laid out for execution by brainwashed proletariat to suppress those excluded from the agenda. How about it is hard work and good parenting? As someone who grew up in a small midwestern agricultural community, married to an immigrant, I worked hard to get my own education, live in an affluent community, educate my children, and be sure that they have a good start to continue our life style. To imply that I'm repressing my fellow citizens, either consciously or unconsciously is just propaganda.
