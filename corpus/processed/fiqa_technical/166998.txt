"I can understand why some people like using the razors due to their anecdotal experiences, but the razors are essentially ""guided reasoning with premade assumptions."" If you want to prove something in a rigorous way, preassumptions are usually not acceptable unless they are facts (i.e. 5 is always less than Infinity, 7 is always bigger than 0, odd is even +1, etc). Merely by stating ""don't attribute to malice/stupidity"" usually fall under the fallacy of affirming the conclusion. For example if a person A really is stupid and hate another person B, he could do everything wrong to make person B suffer. Under both razors, they'd conclude that person A is just incompetent. By proof of contradiction, I've just shown that the result of a model could be different from the truth, thus either the model is wrong or the truth is wrong. Edit: a word"
