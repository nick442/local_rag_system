I worked for someone who has been self employed in that business 20 yrs. She still has a difficult time asking for the money she's earned. Strangely, her husband doesn't! Also, he learned to fire poor employees ASAP. In thier small business, you can't afford to have a lazy, crude, dishonest or childish (needing supervision) employee. Get them out as soon as you realize they can't be helped.
