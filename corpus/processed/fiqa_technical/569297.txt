Your prior earnings have absolutely no bearing on the taxes due on 401k disbursements. Your 401k disbursements are considered income in the tax year in which they are received; whether or not you earn or otherwise acquire additional income. There's no telling what tax brackets and rates will look like that far in the future. But, if your total income including your 401k disbursements is $200,000 you'll likely owe more taxes than if your total was $30,000 including disbursements. I will say though, if you could choose to make $200,000 per year or $30,000 per year with all other factors being equal you choose $200,000 every time. Even if you pay more in taxes, you will have more net income. Now, some pension plans will take in to account either your last year's income, or an average of some number of years income in determining your benefit amount. That's a whole different discussion and will be specific to your pension plan.
