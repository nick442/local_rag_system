You're not talking about capitalism, you're talking about hate for the bourgeois which you refer to as parasites, thus making you the proletariat. You don't own a business, you work for one. If you wanted to create a company, you could because you have the freedom to so do, the opportunity to sacrafice (as this guy did) through discipline and determination. But you don't-- you prefer to debate religion and give people advice and make assertions on the internet. Capitalism is an economic system that is based on private ownership of the means of production and the creation of goods or services for profit. (taken right from wikipedia). This guy built a company from the garage of a small house, driving a 12 year old car while his friends drove new cars and enjoyed healthy salaries. Today his company has 7,000 employees and lots of revenue. Who did he exploit? It sounds like he produced a service, for profit. So what is exploitive? The fact that his revenue and profit are larger than most? His net profit is much lower than gross profit because of already high liabilities, not only including various taxes, but as much or more in mandatory insurances, I'd wager the net profit is less than half of the gross profit. If his liability increases, there is less incentive to continue operations. The fact is he created his business and he can do with it what he pleases.
