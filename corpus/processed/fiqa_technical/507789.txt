First off--congrats on expanding. Just the fact that you're doing that makes one of his points for him. I learned this lesson at 18, watching the owner of the very popular shop sandwich shop where I worked. Line around the block from open until close. He easily made $200,000 a year, but he insisted on micromanaging. If you're making $200K, why the hell are you making sandwiches next to my minimum wage college ass? Run the business, not the minutia. He could have expanded to 5 shops (the way you're planning to expand your dad's business) and been making a million a year to work the same hours. But he had a sick obsession with being involved in every last bit of the work being done. Unfortunately, when people insist on running a one-man show, then that's all they'll ever be.
