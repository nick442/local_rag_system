Minimum wage laws accelerate automation and accelerate putting people out of jobs. I personally agree with them because they help prevent the dregs of society from even being able to get a stupid job at a price that people would pay them, thus making them avoid that given area (the high mininimum wage area). They then move to places where it's not illegal to hire them at a wage at which someone voluntary agrees to pay them.
