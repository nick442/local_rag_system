A rift between Siemens AG (NYSE; SI; XETRA: SIE) and Siemens Israel Ltd. is widening over suspected bribes paid to former Judge Dan Cohen in order to promote the sale of turbines to Israel Electric Corporation (IEC). Siemens Israel managing director Oren Ahronson has been suspended from his duties, under an agreement between the company and its parent. Siemens AG demanded Ahronson's removal.
