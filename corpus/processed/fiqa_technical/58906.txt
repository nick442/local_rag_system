"I can say from personal experience that, as an employee, I would prefer a system like this for determining pay scale. I had a situation happen to me that was similar to the Yak driver analogy in the article: I had been at a software company for a little while, and they were always hiring with a chronic shortage of talent. Finally they hired some new guys, but still had open positions. One of the new guys who came on was making a full $15k more in salary than me, for doing the exact same job-- and no, he wasn't a lead, Sr., or anything like that. No matter how I tried to not let this get to me, it was hard not to let it affect my morale, and I finally ended up leaving the company. So yeah, I'm sure guys like Ntang would say it's my fault for not negotiating a better salary, but since that's impossible (due to the bureaucracy) in most jobs, the fact is that the best way to ""negotiate a better salary"" is usually to just look elsewhere."
