"You should probably bing (feck google) phrases like ""president proposes, congress disposes"" and ""President's budget rejected"" to get a handle on the process. I sincerely wish we could have a president that would stand up to congress and exercise their veto option more often. The only way out of this mess is to stop sending corrupt asshats to congress year after year (after year)."
