For some reason, I've always had a negative feeling about Chase; I don't really know why, but I think I'll continue to avoid them. :) My banks seem to be West Coast banks, mainly Wells Fargo who I've used since the 70s (because they had a small branch in Yosemite Valley, a place I frequented at that time). I haven't had as much luck with other banks, mainly HSBC which I used briefly. Maybe the west coast banks are more laid back or something. Or maybe it's just Chase being incompetent. Banks like that deserve to fail.
