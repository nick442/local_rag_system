You are assuming Romney would actually allow for Free Markets, that's a laugh! You are also assuming Romney would do absolutely nothing. You see, if Romney won and the House stayed republican, we'd see tons of legislation; crony, corrupted, bullshit, but legislation nonetheless. Romney is no bigger of a crony capitalism than Obama, considering Obama has not jailed a single big bank executive for their role in the 2008 meltdown, all this talk about how they differ is bullshit. >In the meanwhile we start building support for a strong candidate in 2016, someone who actually represents us instead of the 1% That's a laugh.
