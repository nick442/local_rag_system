Yes, it is normal. I'm single & pay 32% in North Carolina. Single men & married people ask me all the time why it's so high and it gets frustrating having to explain to average people. I assume it's because I have no kids, live alone, don't own a house, am not in school, am not self employed etc. I've been at this job for 10 years and it's been over 30% since I can remember.
