"This. I see this problem all the time at work (big company). We don't use internal billing, so development is essentially seen as zero cost (already paid for, right?) so the result is.. development can provide infinite resources! We get asked to do way too much, in too little time, for the amount of people we have. Obviously more often than not, nobody is happy with results. We've been trying to implement internal billing in my department but higher ups don't see it, they just want to continue with a ""proper management"" philosophy with no tools to quantify it -- which has not been working."
