"The amount can vary by car rental company and geographic location. I did a Google search using the search term: ""enterprise credit card hold"" The range went from $100 to $500. There is also mention of Jamaica for $1500. The benefit of a credit card in this instance is that the hold is on a virtual balance versus a debit card that will actually hold the money that is in your checking account."
