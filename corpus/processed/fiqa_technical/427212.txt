I absolutely LOVE Taco Bell's marketing department. Like they took the term polish a turd to the next level. I follow them on twitter, like them on Facebook, get their snapchats, shit I even won a taco shirt from them by doing some online scavenger hunt bullshit. I don't even love their food, in fact I think a Chick Fil A grilled chicken sandwich blows away anything on their menu. They've just found this way to come off as your bro by giving you this food thats cool and cheap and edible. And they're social media platforms are actually FUNNY. I don't know how they did it, but they're an incredible company and a totally different company since when I was a kid and they had those dog commercials.
