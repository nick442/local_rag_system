I worked for sears and it was the most abysmally fucking shitty place to work that I have ever experienced.. Perhaps it was because I was an rebellious 17 year old that would come in wearing wingtips and a tie, or perhaps it was because I was getting paid 5-7.5% comission on tv's where the markup was close to 40%. I was taught to upsell people to tv's that were worse than other models with lower price tags. I also learned that Sylvania is basically the most aidsy brand of tv on the planet.
