"You really should try reading the article. Your opinion on the title is great and all, but you'd probably ask more relevant questions if you actually knew what we were talking about here. > Will the taxpayers be given a refund on their tax bills if this deal goesn't through? No. Are you familiar with taxes in the US at all? That is not something this country does often. > What else will the tax dollars be spent on ? Pretty much anything? Money can be spent on many things. Currency in general is a great trade assistant. Are you familiar with how money works? Seriously. Read the article. > The reality is, either the state can invest in things that create jobs, or they can spend on things that create nothing. I mean no, this isn't all that the state can do. That being said, ""create jobs"" is a huge gray area that doesn't require making horrible financial decisions that will never, ever give a positive ROI. If you think this is literally the only job creating opportunity this state has, or if you can't track that it's even possible for a state to consider more than one thing at a time, I dunno what to tell you. Also. Read the fucking article. It's like 6 paragraphs. I have no idea why you think that anyone should read your opinion if you can't even put in the time to see what the conversation is about."
