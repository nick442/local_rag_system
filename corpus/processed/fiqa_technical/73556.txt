"It depends on the area, but right in Toronto there's not a whole lot of development, but like starter townhouses (3 storey, modern/executive look, around 2000sq ft) start around 750k. Older and run houses, depending on area can go from 600-1.4 million, but it's heavily dependent on area. In a ""good"" area, you'll see completely run down shacks going for 1.4 million. I'm not sure exactly who's buying these houses, but banks aren't giving as many loans now, so I assume people are going private for mortgages. There are incentives for first time home buyers where you don't need much of a down payment (it was around 10%, but I think it's gone up), however something called ""mortgage insurance"" is required, in the case of a default. Rent is sky high as well, and rentals are just as expensive as mortgages, however without the ""commitment"". Cheap rentals never come up, and there is sort of an internal issue with realtors who essentially hike up the prices, however things have cooled off as of late. I always remember my parents saying that we good do down to the states and buy a house for less than 100k, especially after '08. Houses just seem to have more value in Canada, even in less sought after areas more north"
