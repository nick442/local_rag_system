"If that's the case, why not *lower* the minimum wage? That would instantly make US companies more profitable and make US a great target for foreign investment. Both labor costs are cut down, and as you say, rent and everything will immediately drop. Companies free up a lot of capital for expansion and we can quickly gain 100% employment, as anyone can have a job at say, $1/hour. A lot of interesting innovation would have to happen to sell food affordable for a $1/hour work. I'm thinking artificially flavored cardboard burgers. Organic and eco friendly: imagine, the packaging IS the meal. I call this the ""trickle up"" theory, or ""economic regurgitation""."
