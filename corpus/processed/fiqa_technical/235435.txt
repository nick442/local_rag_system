">I'm not going to engage you in a philosophical debate about corporations vs. people. Corporations are legal structures given a legal status by government to facilitate the cooperation of labor, production and capital. In return for this, corporations are subject to regulations and laws. They are not people. This is something ""corporations are people, my friends"" needs to learn. >P.S. Not taxing losses is hardly corporate welfare and GE did not get a tax ""refund."" So where did they get that money from? Where do you think that $3.4billion came from? Do you think that $3.4billion just magically appeared out of thin air? Do you think GE invented a tree that grows money? That $3.4billion came from taxpayers/US Treasury because GE carried over losses - as such it was refund."
