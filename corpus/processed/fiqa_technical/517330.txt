Yeah. I agree about that last sentence. It was silly but I was too lazy to edit it. *Note that I'm not saying his representations of and predictions about Obama's policies are accurate* I agree with you on that point as well. I don't know how my familiarity with Obama's policies stack up with his and if either of us truly know the big picture. I had to put the thought down to see how everyone else felt. We can't argue that it's been, in the least, a good opportunity for discussion. My other thought was the gumption he had to even throw this out there. On some level he thinks he has a grip on how things will play out insomuch that he predicts the future if Obama was reelected.
