"I'll go ahead and reply for fun, I'm not trying to get into a heated debate on the internet lol. Having said that, there is a big difference between Herbalife and Amway. I saw a documentary on Netflix called betting on zero, I think you might enjoy that documentary. The thing is that Amway is the largest debt free organization in the world pulling in over a billion dollars a month and paying back to their IBOs $5 billion in 2016. Again, debt free. There is a book by robert kiyosaki called the business of the 21st century and he talks about MLM as the best way to take people from being employees to being entrepreneurs. In the real world you have to go millions of dollars to start any traditional franchise like McDonald's for instance. Or buy real estate you need a ""small loan of a million dollars"" like trumps father haha. My overhead for my business is $120 a month roughly. This is something I can afford without going into debt to start a business. The people I am being mentored by are absolutely the best in North America (Seattle) and they have been debt free millionaires since the 80s. If the people trying to con you into joining their smoothie club don't have that level of success I would follow the advice everyone on reddit loves to give ""run away"". You want to follow people who have the results you want in life."
