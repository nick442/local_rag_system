I am a big fan of what we call inheritance tax. I think it is by far the fairest way we have of redistributing wealth. I don't believe a kid should be entitled to the parents ability to earn and that they should have to achieve that themselves. The relationship is clearly complicated between welfare and employment. I believe the US employment issues are far more to do with the overall economy and less to do with benefits. The nations that do have high welfare and good employment, such as the scandie nations, have not been as effected by the global downturn for numerous other reasons (Norway is essentially one giant oil hedge fund) and so are hard to compare. Any southern European nation can be an example of the opposite.
