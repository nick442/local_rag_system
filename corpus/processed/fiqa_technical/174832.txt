"Many in management seem to live in an alternate reality from those who work for a living. When IBM shunted some techs into another company they put them on probation for a year (even though they were high performers - some with 25+ years at IBM = no job security) and cut their pay 25%. The next time they went to move workers the first question was ""how much is the pay cut this time"". Management's reply, ""No pay cut because we found when we did it before it negatively affected morale."" I thought: ""No kidding. They had to actually cut people's pay 25% to figure that out? What planet DO they live on?"""
