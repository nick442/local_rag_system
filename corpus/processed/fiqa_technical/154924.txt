How about this. Make it mandatory that anyone can ask to use any portion of any invention at a market reasonable price. In the event that someone believes the price is not market reasonable, then one company can file suit against the other company. The person filing person will pay for the court case. This of course would take into account what is reasonable for court costs, etc. Bam, then we have an end to what really sucks about patents, the inability for others to use that in the future.
