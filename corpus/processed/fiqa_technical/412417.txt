They remain navigable, so with enough warning they can fly out of the path. Which sort of sucks since it mans you lose connectivity *during* the hurricane. From the videos, they say they fly these balloons into the stratosphere, up to 65 thousand feet; they may be able to fly these *above* the hurricane if it is small enough. Not sure if they would be too far away to provide LTE connectivity during that time though. I don't think they can come down and be re-launched the way another comment said. They have a custom launching hardware you can see in the videos, and they would essentially need to re-inflate the balloons. Keeping this equipment safe and operable during a hurricane is going to be the real challenge with this, and afaik they only have a few launchers, and then juts fly the balloons to be in place, so much more likely they would fly them out of the way, then fly either those balloons or new balloons in place after the hurricane has passed.
