I feel the same about voting for Obama as I do about voting for Reagan: total embarrassment. Not that I could have voted for Romney without feeling even worse, but I could have 'thrown my vote away' on some distant third-placer who would not have won but at least would not be so eager to hand the country over to anyone with a ton of money.
