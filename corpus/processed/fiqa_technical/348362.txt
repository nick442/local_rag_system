No no no.. ok fine, yes.. **but** you can't have that and run a national deficit of 150% of GDP. I don't care what Keynes said, you could have as large a demand as you want, if the majority of all cash flows are going into debt repayments your economies not going to be able to grow, ie: enter a recession.
