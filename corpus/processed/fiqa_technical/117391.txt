"19500 - The balance isn't held all month. It's held on average for half a month (assuming the days money was spent was randomly distributed). 260/(1.5% - 4%/(24)) Edit: That answer only works if they pay off their balance at the end of the month - 260/(1.5% - 4%*(3/24)) gives 26000 if the average balance is held for a month and a half. But either way, leaving out the ""half a month"" results in a messy number."
