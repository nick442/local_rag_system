"The course is free to ""audit,"" which means you take the courses and exams, and get graded, but don't receive a certificate upon satisfactorily passing. If you want said certificate, the cost is usually between $50-$100. The knowledge is more valuable, in my opinion. I will be taking the above course as an audit of the course."
