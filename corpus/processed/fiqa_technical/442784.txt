Now, what if I were to spend the entire $2,000 limit on a single purchase? I've been saving up in anticipation of this purchase and therefore have the money already set aside in the bank, so I could pay off the entire $2k immediately. There is no problem with doing this. There's a bit of a time delay in credit reporting, so if you pay immediately in the middle of your statement period it will never even be reported that your card was maxed out. Make the purchase some time in the middle of the billing period, then log in to your account and pay the total before the statement period closes. If you let it roll to the next statement period, it will be reported that your account is maxed out, and possibly, you will be charged interest and potentially a fee for exceeding your limit. Your utilization is only calculated in a snapshot, there is no history kept. Even if you let your card be reported at 100% utilization, you could pay the balance that month with 0% then reported and your score will bounce back as though nothing ever happened. Separately, if you have had this card for a long while you may want to request a credit line increase.
