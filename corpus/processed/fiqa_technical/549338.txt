Did you ever wonder why LightSquared is forced to use the frequencies to begin with? If we did not have auctions that priced out all competitors except the largest incumbents, we might have real competition. Simple solution, make some of the incumbents give up their hoarded spectrum. Build a single wholesale network (instead of 4+ separate networks that are all starved for spectrum). Fix the problem, don't kill competition
