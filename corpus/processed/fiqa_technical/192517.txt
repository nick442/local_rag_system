">> So with all those ""maybe""(s), and since Trump did not Act on the subject, for God sake, why is that the FIRST thing you could say against Trump? > You interjected those ""maybe""(s), not me. My issue on this topic has always been, and still is, that President Trump said.. You are in an endless loops of ""maybe""(s) and ""he said this and that"". No actions that you oppose, am I right? >>>Global warming is a serious risk to this country. >>Absolutely not! > I have long studied arguments on both sides. The science is solid and the result in unequivocal. You are wrong.. I can prove this is real Trust me, I studied this too. It's nice to have the same weather and no changes, but it never was like this on Earth. I am VERY concerned about emissions and pollution and recycling. But the paranoia and ""end of the world"" folks do not impress me. With science we will be able to control the weather on earth easily. Easily!! Do you know that [1 billion trees were planted in Pakistan](https://www.voanews.com/a/one-billion-trees-planted-in-pakistan-nw-province/3983609.html) recently? >> So, please, tell me one substantial reason why you are against Trump? > I have given you two and you have rejected them both. You don't get it! Look, I have more than 2 things I can say against Trump, of action he did. And yet I support him. You can't come with one ACTION by Trump you oppose, and you are still against him. >> ..do you really think that if Hillary was in charge it would be better? > I'm not touching that one. Because you voted for her, and would vote for her today despite the long list of terrible things she and the DNC did. Tribalism? Remember, I voted for Obama twice, for Al Gore (idiot) and Kerry (bigger idiot), never for Republican until the last elections."
