The article is a bit shortsighted. It is basing its theory on the age difference between India and the other Asian countries. However, how does automation play into this? Also, India has 80%+ of its people in poverty. With automation around the corner, I can only imagine this to be worse than it already is. Not saying India does not have potential to be a tremendous influence in the region. However, to say it will be a superpower might be a bit of a stretch. At this point it is no longer guaranteed that China will become a superpower.
