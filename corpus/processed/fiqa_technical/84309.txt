"They exceed in rote academics, tasks that lend well to memorization. But they lag in areas that require critical thinking and ""thinking outside the box"". There have been a few recent studies on the subject but my google-fu is lacking right now. It's not racial, but rather cultural and the effect has to do with the teaching style employed. I imagine it comes from having to memorize 30-50,000 shapes and meanings, writing them over and over, you spend more time on that and less time being trained to be creative like the western approach. There are advantages and disadvantages to each. And also, you have an element of 1st wave immigrant bias involved (I don't think that's the right term, but I remember the basic concept discussed in a couple of my econ courses). The early immigrants to a country tend to be the most self motivated, the most skilled. Key word here is ""tend"", not all, but most of the 1st wave are the most entrepreneurial. This is most pronounced in immigration to a new country. Once the wave of immigration has become established, you get the 2nd and 3rd wave of immigrants come in, where those that come in lack the skills of the 1st wave and are able to take advantage of the inroads laid by those who came first."
