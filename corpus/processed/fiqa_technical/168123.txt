"It could be just as exploitable given the current system. Also, who is this ""owner""? A large shareholder of a public corporation isn't just going to come into 16 houses. There's a board of directors, and about a million other shareholders, including those in blackrock and vangaurd who have nothing to gain from allowing such corruption. A private company's owner who decided to buy himself a house on the company's dime and not tell the IRS can do so at his peril regardless of tax policy. I still don't understand the point."
