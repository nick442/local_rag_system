I honestly don't understand this sense of entitlement to being able to use your own device. By giving an employee access to sensitive data on their own device, you are taking a risk that the company cannot technologically or legally mitigate. In the UK it would be a de-facto breach of the Data Protection Act. If there was a rootkit on an employee's phone or laptop, and they got access to any sensitive data then game over. This is not about inconvenience, it is about not costing the companies in question billions in fines. It is simply not worth it - especially as most employees are perfectly capable of losing work computers on trains and so on, so trusting them to look after their own system security is asking a bit much. What happens if they lose their own laptop? A work laptop can be set to self destruct, but few employees are going to let their companies have that level of control over their laptop. And, here in the UK, if sensitive data is lost in that way and can be recovered using forensic tools then - bam - fines. A company has a legal obligation to ensure that their employee's and customer's data is safe, and any data accessed on a phone or laptop is still stored somewhere on that phone or laptop. Third party software like Dropbox is notoriously insecure, too, so that shouldn't ever be used on a machine containing sensitive data. It's hard enough getting employees to take security seriously before exponentially increasing these risks as you describe.
