Of course there's no impetus. This is the reality of low skill jobs. That's why my original comment in this thread said that they had no chance of this strike working. Strikes only work when you have something to bargain with. It boggles my mind that people still think they can develop no skill greater than lifting heavy things and sliding products across a scanner and end up with a good paying job. This is the freaking 21st century, and these people have less skills than a loom worker in the 1800s. Of course, they don't get good pay.
