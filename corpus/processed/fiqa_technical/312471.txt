There is a BWW down the road from me. There's also a local gastropub down the road that has wings that are just as good as BWW if not better. The local gastropub is cheaper, has better happy hour specials, has a better atmosphere, treats their workers well and is locally owned. Why on Earth would I go to BWW? Really not hard to understand.
