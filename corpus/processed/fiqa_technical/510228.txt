It's possible. Our healthcare systems is a serious mess, but universal healthcare could also make things worse. The problem is that our healthcare system is afflicted by a litany of regulations neither guarantee care to the most vulnerable nor allow the market mechanisms to work. The Mises Institute has a few good pieces on this ([here's one](https://mises.org/blog/how-government-regulations-made-healthcare-so-expensive)), but to put it very simply, the issue is we are letting bureaucrats run our healthcare instead of leaving medical choices to physicians. I'd wager that NZ physicians have greater freedom to practice than US ones, but that's only a guess. That's the key though. Medical choices need to be left up to doctors and patients whether we adopt a market-oriented system or a universal care scheme. If this isn't done, quality of care will be poor and costs (direct or indirect) will be high. At the end of the day we could screw up either approach. I will say, that I've read Sen. Rand Paul's [proposal](https://www.paul.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/ObamacareReplacementActSections.pdf) (not the current Republican plan) and it seems like a good example of practical market reforms.
