I see what you mean, we are talking about different things. You are talking about early check-in. Which you can on Airbnb sometimes, usually though it's similar to hotel times in the afternoon. I was talking about check-in at any time after you actually have booked. If I booked it I can even arrive at like 3am in the night and not worry I'm keeping someone up. But with an Airbnb host it's a lot less likely. As I said some might leave you the keys. I even had a host who made me wait an hour to let me check 10pm. Because of some security thing. Obviously renting it when they shouldn't be. That said, still use and prefer Airbnb. But was saying at a hotel you can check in any time (implication was after you booked) and an Airbnb you are at their mercy.
