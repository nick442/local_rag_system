Sometimes what is holding us back are internalized barriers which don't really exist. Sometimes it is possible to pull yourself up by your bootstraps if only you try. But I think conservatives underestimate the difficulties of following a new paradigm. I've become fascinated by this topic because it ties in with my thoughts on visionary thinking. What is it that allows some people to break out of rigid patterns of thought, i.e. routines? Researchers in artificial intelligence are developing interesting theories on how to train neural networks to find new possibilities quicker. Some of this research might apply to the human mind and how creativity works. Anyway, I don't think people can see a way out of poverty when you only present them with hypothetical possibilities. I think we need mentoring programs and apprenticeships. People can only follow a new paradigm when they have an example before them. In other words, if they can do it, I can do it. But when nobody around you is doing it then you are not going to give the possibility much weight. No observations support that optimism.
