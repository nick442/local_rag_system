> I do know Big Tobacco split their co's in half between domestic (US) and international operations due to the incredibly burdensome regulatory environment. It was holding back growth plans. There may be some of that here. US Corps are also taxed on foreign earnings (unlike what other countries do). Doing this probably raised their profits 20% on anywhere not called the USA. Given that the domestic market for cigs is in constant decline, but not nearly as bad outside the US, it only makes sense to retain more earnings as the customer base shifts to strictly foreign.
