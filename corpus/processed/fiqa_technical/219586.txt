I've come around on that, as many in IT grow beyond their formal degree. Also, at least from my experience with DataSec in a corporate environment, it's usually making sure everyone is either performing required remediations or documenting why said remediation can't be performed (business risk). The hard work is performed by the application and infrastructure technology owners who have to review the fix and plan how to patch it in as gentle / not disruptive way as possible. The higher up exert the enforcement of the policies and making sure the underlings stay on top of the reported findings.
