Just gotta weigh that against any perceived benefit. Regardless, I wouldn't personally use a static salt alone, because that would lower security dramatically if it was ever discovered. Creating a single rainbow table using a known static salt is much easier than 100 million with unique salts. It's a gamble whether they're dumping your database from an exploit that would give them access to that information.
