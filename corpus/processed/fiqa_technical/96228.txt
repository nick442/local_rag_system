"> the president has little to nothing to do with the stock market. Absolutely not! Nonsense! The president can easily kill the economy and cause a crash in the stock market in few day. The current improvement in the economy, employment, stock market, etc is directly because of Trump stance against the TPP, Immigration, over-regulation, etc. > What I do is listen to the idiotic words that your leader says. He's your president! He's much smarter than Hillary who can't even handle debate questions unless she cheat with another fake-News, CNN. For God sake, never ever any candidate did such a thing and if my son cheated on a test like this, he would be expelled from school. In any case, Trump must be smart because he's very successful business person, and Hillary is just ""the wife of"". How can anyone vote for Hillary or Democrats in the last elections is beyond me. And for your information, I am a democrat who voted for Obama twice, for Al Gore (idiot!) and Kerry (a bigger idiot!). The DNC is totally corrupt, evil, untrustworthy and dysfunctioning. I hope that by next election they will fix the issues and have a descent candidate. Most likely not."
