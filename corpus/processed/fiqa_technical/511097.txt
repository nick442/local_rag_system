"I can see where you are coming from, but with that logic then apple spent all that time and money to develop and market the iPhone 8 just to use it as an expensive marketing device, and I don't buy that. if they did do that however, it would have made more sense for them to increase the storage slightly and keep the price of the iPhone 7 the same and then release the iPhone x. That way they would have a little more profit from the 7 since cost of production is cheaper now that it is a year old, and consumers can either have the newest iPhone and shell out for it, or have an iPhone that still works great and now comes with more storage. Now, if they called the iPhone 8 the iPhone 7s, I think there wouldn't be such a negative image about it in terms of it being a rather small upgrade, because the ""s"" iteration usually is just a spec bump and no one would bat an eye at that, but since it got the title of being the 8th iPhone, people expect more from it."
