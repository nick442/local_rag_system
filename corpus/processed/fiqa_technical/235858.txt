Actually that is really interesting and I noticed it myself but it never clicked. I work with multiple groups in different areas and also in my own company and I'm the youngest by far (also 28). Everyone around me at the very youngest has kids and most are 50+ year olds. I don't know how it'll play out come 10 years from now but it'll be interesting to say the least.
