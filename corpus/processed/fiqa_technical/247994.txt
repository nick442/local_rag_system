"Who are the ""regular competitors"" of Netflix? Is it the cable providers like Comcast? Is it content providers like HBO? I don't see Netflix ""destroying"" either of those, given that: * Netflix rarely owns the content it's distributing; * Comcast owns the pipes for distribution, and; * HBO makes generally better stuff than Netflix, at least for now. So what's your argument here, exactly? Are you just pissed about having to make a choice to pay Netflix for a 100% discretionary service that you don't need to accept?"
