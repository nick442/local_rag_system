For now Amazon is cool. It's trendy, innovative, smart, convenient, market competitive insert positive note after positive note. For now, Amazon is a trendy super power. Our society that places such a heavy importance on STEM (nothing wrong with that at all) swoons over there grocery ads where people walk into grocery stores and walk out. Oh Amazon has such a cool factor to it that for now people don't realize how powerful they are getting. The markets they are in, the markets they have plans for. Strangely I don't see Amazon losing their cool factor soon, but they will when people wake up. We wonder why 6 companies control the media, just a few control everything in the grocery store. 30 years from now, Amazon will be the subject of some tell all uncovering documentary wondering how it all happened.
