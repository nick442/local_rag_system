>Bankruptcy is simply a financial tool inside our legal system, nothing more, nothing less. So hypothetically, if I were a high net worth individual. I create a number of Corporations and put all my assets in them. I lease a car with Corp #2 - which I never have more than a few thousand $ in. Have my House in Malibu in Corp#1 My place is Manhattan is in C#3 I am an employee of C#4, 5 and 6. I crash my car into you and you are permanently disabled. You can't work, you don't have much savings, lose your house or apartment. As it turns out, there is no insurance on the car and the lease hasn't been paid in months. You sue me. No assets in Corp #1. You sue me personally - yet on paper I don't own anything. My personal net worth is effectively $0. Assuming you can find an attorney to take this on - and you win in court and get a judgement against me. I have no assets. Nothing to take, nothing to garnish - nothing at all. You on the other hand have bills piling up not to mention the $100's thousands in medical expenses. You are ruined. I am vacationing in the South of France. Nothing unethical about that I guess. *spelling miztaks
