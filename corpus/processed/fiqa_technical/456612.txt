"But we aren't in a Malthusian world, at least for the moment. Right now, with an exception made for extreme weather, basically every country on earth produces enough food to feed its citizens. I don't personally have a problem with efficiency in food production, and using ""gross"" as a standard with food is not terribly helpful. But the argument that we need this level of meat processing in America because people are starving just isn't a good argument."
