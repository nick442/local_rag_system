"Sometimes a business must keep track of overhead expenses that can be used to determine the rates they will bill their customers especially the government. When determining the rates they are allowed to charge the government they have to include direct costs and indirect costs. These indirect costs include allowable overhead and G&A. They can also include profit, but the government limits the maximum profit. Any unallowable expenses have to come out of profit. Unallowable expenses include: ""Costs of amusement, diversions, social activities, and any directly associated costs such as tickets to shows or sports events, meals, lodging, rentals, transportation, and gratuities are unallowable."" When they talk about meals and lodging being unallowable they are referring to those not needed to support the contract. If the contract expects the contractor to travel they will generally provide a travel budget that is separate from the amounts used to determine the hourly rate. The term slush fund has the connotation of being illegal or hidden. Slush funds are used to bribe officials or are leftover funds that were supposed to be spent, and are now being hidden so that they can be misused at a later date."
