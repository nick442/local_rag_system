Can you elaborate on how corporate tax cuts exactly drain the economy and destroy jobs? I feel like, going straight off text-book, his tax-plans make sense. It's very possible that I am a really confused student. (Currently second year student) -edit This is my interpretation of the capital-tax-gain-cut proposed by the Trump administration based on what I have learned in Micro/Macro-Econ thus far in college: Less capital tax = less pressure on the wealthy/entrepreneurs (since you keep bigger portion of your net income, the interest to bring back business should increase) = capital inflow back to the US. I feel like I'm missing something big here since a lot of folks seem to be against this, and I want to understand why something is the way it is. Thank you in advance.
