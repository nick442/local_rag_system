**Doping in Russia** Doping in Russian sports is a significant issue. Russia has had the most (37) Olympic medals stripped for doping violations â€“ four times the number of the second country. From 2011 to 2015, more than a thousand Russian competitors in various sports, including summer, winter, and Paralympic sports, benefited from a cover-up.
