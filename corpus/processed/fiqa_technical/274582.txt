Good point. It is extremely rare that something does go awry, and in the case of exports (where the units are delivered flat packed for self assembly) chances are it would be a mistake made by the person installing the shed (whether a local carpenter or the client themselves) which we would not cover under warranty unless a manufacturing or material fault was found. As all our units are put together in the workshop and checked this is unlikely.
