I probably haven't been alive for hundreds of years? No, I assure you I haven't been around for that long. As for me saying that I should've been in the solar eclipse glasses business, don't take it literally..I'm really just saying that the companies that make the glasses are raking it in right now. Getting into the business after the fact is bad timing, though..sure, there will be other eclipses and you could sell some glasses, but nothing like Monday's eclipse will occur again in our lifetime. The companies that make the glasses will never have sales like this again. Which country are you from anyway?
