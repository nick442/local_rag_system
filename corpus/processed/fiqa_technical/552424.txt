"TV is just distribution, be it a lucrative one. The Networks (for the most part) don't produce shows. They set up deals with production companies and if they like the idea give the go ahead to make 1/2 dozen or so episodes. If ratings are there, then they'll order another season. This system 'works' because the networks will hope for a 10% success rate (or something like that). So, one in ten shows is a reasonable/major success. Will that process end if networks end? No, that's silly. Production values may suffer, but how much does it cost to make a Seinfeld (excluding the incredible salaries for actors and writers)? Not a whole lot. Comedy Central is famous for giving comedians a shot at a show on TV in exchange for low reimbursement. The top talent will always flow towards the best salaries, but the future may show the top talent risking their own reimbursement in exchange for profit sharing and risk taking. Louis CK did so with his recent stand up act; he did very well and has inspired copycats. One of the studios (or production companies) called his bypassing the tradition route of middlemen and promoters (who take the lions share of the profits) ""unamerican."" So the establishment sees the writing on the wall and resorts to upstarts as unamerican. They will resort to laws to try to stop consumers getting what they want, but torrents and other bypasses will keep the pressure on. My wife will come home, turn on the TV, and zone out. But nobody else in my social circle does this. It may be a male-female thing, or a generational thing, I don't know. However, ""TV has always been innovative"" is not the way I see it. In fact, it really only blocks progress. From cable monopolies to trying to stop VCRs, the networks are an oligopoly trying to keep competitors out."
