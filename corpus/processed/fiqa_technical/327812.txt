I completely agree with the other posters, I don't want this to become WSO. If we had a FAQ for topics such as CFA, internships, networking etc. in the sidebar, it would decrease the number of such posts significantly. There's already a lot of good info in older posts, people just aren't willing to search for it. Mods, I'd be happy to go through some of the older stuff and compile it together. There's also supposed to be a wiki feature coming soon for subreddits.
