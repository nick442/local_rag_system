this is absolutely correct.Take the very simplest of fast food - Subway - and try to automate it. You will get some sort of 3D printer type device. It makes no sense. there is no way it can work. There is no way you can deliver made-to-order food with a computer right now, not even close. Also, ask yourself, do you want a robot-made pizza in an era of farm-to-table organic free-range etc?
