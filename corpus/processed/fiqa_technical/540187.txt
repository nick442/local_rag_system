Pretty sure they said they went up by 3% or more after it was legalized. You need to realize that these statistics are all not helpful at all. While someone is saying fatal car wrecks didn't increase, someone hit and disabled the rest of their life wouldn't count towards this. There was also someone saying that claims have gone up 16% since pot was legal in Colorado but that could be from someone hitting a tree or just bumping another driver. Regardless though, they still went up. Overall, if they police smoking and driving as heavily as they do with alcohol, then fine I guess. I'd rather if people were impaired that they stayed off the road but people are ignorant and assume getting high is 100% safe.
