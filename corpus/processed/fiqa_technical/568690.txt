>In this case, Aldi is making its own (low quality) branded goods (instead of allowing for capitalist/competitive brand selection) and excluding from its stores all other branded goods made by other companies. Which is part of why their prices are lower. >Aldi is not a membership club and sells almost exclusively low-quality in-house brands. The only think Aldi doesn't do is the membership thing everything else is borrowed from Costco. The no shelves in the store, boxes stacked on top of each other, limited staff, company owned label, etc. Also if their quality was low then why do so many people like them? I never been in one before but they won't be expanding as rapidly as they are if they won't doing so well.
