"did you pull that info from fox or something? please step out of your bubble, visit one of those countries and talk to people living there. being a german myself, i can assure you our system isnt ""crumbling"" due to UHC, we had this for decades and as even you might have heard our economy is pretty fine besides the leiharbeit bullshit (the U.S. CEO repeatedly ranted about the german trade surplus on twitter). granted, ours is one of the most expensive compared to other OECD countries and it could probably made more efficient, but shits made by humans, and those have flaws. its still only about 10% of GDP (pulled from german wiki). how much did you spend on military again? ^^^hint: ^^^never ^^^less ^^^than ^^^16%, ^^^usually ^^^around ^^^20%"
