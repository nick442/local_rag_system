I think it's interesting that the other answers here all focus on the possibility of a software glitch or other unintentional error in the ATM behaviour. Personally, I keep ATM receipts so that if I spot a withdrawal I don't recognise, it sways it in favour of being fraud (as opposed to memory failure) if I also don't have a receipt for it. I also always withdraw the same amount and it is not one of the default amounts presented on the screen. Again, just a way to make any fraudulent transaction stand out on my statement.
