ok so greece and ireland- funding of the banks has added quite a bit of deficit over the past couple of years. this has been problematic, as countries become unwilling to ask for help to save the bank because of the poor public image that it carries - no politician wants to increase the deficit in favor of bank (expect americans ? LOL) additionally, it has a negative impact on economy (discussed below) this year, ECB has agreed to allow direct recapitalization of banks. This means that the Spanish Govt will not be responsible for bank funding when the bailout is established - thus reducing the impact on spain's economy. there will not be an increase in deficit when spanish banks are recapitalized in the past, with ireland and greece, it was difficult because - countries had to implement austerity measure and accept funding to recapitalize bank. weakened balance sheet of troubled countries drove up the cost of money, making it more difficult to recapitalize the banks, which worked in a cycle. direct recapitalization has been implemented to limit this effect
