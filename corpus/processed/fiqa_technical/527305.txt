"*Moving your text out of order for (I hope) clarity* > Because.. (it) is a violation of the social contract. I'm quite sure I explained this already multiple times. You've not explained, you just keep repeating your assertion. You say ""The social contract is X"" and I ask, ""Why must it be X"" and you respond, ""Because the social contract is X."" Let me try a different approach. > Because the only modern justification for the existence of a nation is the social contract. I disagree. I think a nation can exist for whatever reason it's populace decides and today, more often than not, it includes providing for the welfare of it's citizens. What do you think prevents a social contract from being so? > Exactly. That's why we have the social contract.. Great! It sounds like you now agree that a modern government is required for capitalism to exist. > Please elaborate as to why that is a problem in the first place. Because it makes for an unstable system which will hurt the welfare of the people which is opposed to my definition of the social contract."
