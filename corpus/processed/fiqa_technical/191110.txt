"Similar story. I was in the market for an electric smoker. By sheer luck, the exact unit I wanted went on a very good sale at Lowe's. I checked online to see if the nearest Lowe's had any in stock. The system showed only one in stock, and I knew it would go fast at that price, so I immediately ordered it for in-store pickup. Several hours later, I still hadn't gotten the ""your pickup is ready"" email, so I called the 1-800 customer service line, and was basically told that it should be ready but that the stores often didn't do what needed to be done to trigger the final email. I drove over to Lowe's, took my printed order confirmation in to the service desk, and was met with three staff members who acted like they had never heard of an online order before. They discussed things amongst themselves, then engaged a manager, who was similarly flummoxed. After 20 minutes of runaround, I was getting pretty agitated, and finally just walked over to the grill/smoker area, found the smoker, still on the shelf, took it back to the desk and told them that I was leaving. They seemed OK with that. I asked if they needed to check my printout, or scan the box, or get me a receipt, and they all agreed that they did not. I walked out with no receipt, no proof of purchase (having given my printout to them earlier), and carrying merchandise that I picked myself, and they all seemed pretty happy that it had turned out that way. Good fucking luck, Lowe's. With service like that, you'll need it."
