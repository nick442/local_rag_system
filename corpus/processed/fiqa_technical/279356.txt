"Having just come back from China, two things regarding its continued growth on this topic stuck out to me: 1) The need and want for high quality American Made goods - the Chinese acknowledge they are the kings at manufacturing things en masse, and that the Americans are the kings at making things that can last for life. 2) China is slowly starting to push manufacturing off to African countries as they continue to rise. Given that, it should be noted that once you leave a large city like Beijing or Shanghai and see the ""real China"" you can see how the country is artificially propped up by the government. Everything from real estate to its tech giants. A recession is looming there and could hit it hard. One quick edit: As Americans, we are often force fed this notion that the Chinese hate us, and all of this other nonsense. It is actually quite the opposite. While there is a fair level of blind kool-aid drinking and communist party following, the Chinese people actually love American citizens and very much want what we have. The Chinese word for United States is Měiguó, which means beautiful country."
