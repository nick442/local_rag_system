I hear what you're saying @mgibbons. It's just that how much they're paid shouldn't really be an issue. Poor customer service seems to be why they're about to get replaced by these turnstyles. Be nice. Save your job. (Even in situations where entitled, snobbish people are arguing and giving you a hard time.) Yes, travelers can be more civil. Yes, gate attendants can be nicer. Yes, we all have to treat each other better.
