> No it's really not, I have no illusions that private school is any better than the public schools around here. The problems with them differ, but one is no better than the other. Our education system in Florida is broken, the voucher system they instituted created broken schools and soon to be bankrupt private schools. Every state that's done so has or soon will have the same problems. Even states that aren't screwing their public schools with vouchers, are screwing them with poor funding at every level. How do vouchers fuck over our education system? Doesn't it allow parents to pick the best school for their kids despite their economic condition? I may be mistaken on what vouchers are. Isn't it just the government paying for what ever school you decide to go to? >Every state that's done so has or soon will have the same problems. Source please. >Shits broke, and getting more broke every year. Eventually it might get fixed, but I'm not going to play 'maybe' games with my kids. I'd rather move them to a country that isn't supporting the most expensive military on the planet. As long as you send your kids to a school where they don't fear for their lives, have teachers that at least do the bare minimum, and you are involved in your kid's school life, then they will be fine. It isn't a school that makes the kids successful, it is the parents who are active in their kids lives. If the school is also good, then that is all the better. Canada isn't a magical wonderland. I get the feeling that you surround yourself in an echo chamber of other parents who are mad at the education system. You guys build off each other to make America's education system seem like hell on earth.
