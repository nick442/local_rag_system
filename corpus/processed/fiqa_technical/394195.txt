I disagree. Employee pay has always been a budgetary line item to large business owners. That's just the way it is. Much of the reason for the decrease in the percent of revenue going to employees is because companies, nowadays, don't need to hire as many people. Technology has reduced the number of employees most industries require while still maintaining or boosting productivity. I think a more fair way of looking at these figures would be to look at the sum of both employee pay and capital expenses as a percent of revenue.
