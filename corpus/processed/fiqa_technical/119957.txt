Okay, if you pay me money, and then i send it back to you, that's not the same thing as you paying no money and me sending you money. The state is not out any money it wouldnt have if the factory wasnt there. To rephrase, the state has just as much money as if the factory was not there, except they will get additional tax revenue in the future and get more jobs for citizens.
