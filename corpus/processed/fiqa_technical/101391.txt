> Cutting taxes to raise tax revenue is a fantasy that has never come true. Reagan tried it and the deficit skyrocketed, so he reversed it: Yet it is true when you understand economics. Texas is living proof of that. Big government overspending and trillions of dollars of extra national debt year over year is extremely wasteful, unsustainable with the threat of national bankruptcy. >**[Trade Helps Explain Texas-Sized Job Growth](http://www.cato.org/blog/trade-helps-explain-texas-sized-job-growth)** > By Daniel Griswold JULY 26, 2011 12:38PM > As its governor, Rick Perry, weighs a run for the White House, Texas has drawn attention for its healthy job growth. Since the recession ended in June 2009, **Texas has accounted for half of the net new jobs added to the U.S. economy, according to the lead story in this morning’s USA Today.** That’s quite a record for one lone state. We’ll leave it to others for now to argue over how much credit Gov. Perry can claim. > **Some credit surely goes to high oil prices, fueling job growth in a sector important to the Texas economy. Another reason for its relatively strong job growth is a friendly business climate, including no state income tax and relatively light regulations. And for those who scapegoat trade for the nation’s persistently high unemployment rate, consider that Texas is the nation’s number one trading state.** As the USA Today story notes: > Overseas shipments by Texas’ strong computer, electronics, petrochemical and other industries rose 21% last year, compared with 15% for the nation, according to the Dallas Federal Reserve Bank. The state also benefits from its proximity to Latin American countries that are big importers of U.S. goods … The surge creates jobs for Texas manufacturers and ports. > As I can attest from recent speaking engagements in San Antonio and Laredo, Texans have embraced their state’s position as the nation’s leading gateway for trade with NAFTA-partner Mexico and the rest of Latin America. > While politicians and union bosses from other states grumble about allegedly unfair trade, the latest trade and job numbers show that the people of Texas are making the most of the opportunities created by our more open economy.
