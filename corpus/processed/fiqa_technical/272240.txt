I'm fine with this. I'm fine with any job being replaced with a robot, if it's possible and better than a person. McDonalds employees, stock broker, cotton picker, whatever. Jobs get replaced by robots constantly, and that's not the problem. When a company increases their profits by replacing a person with automation, they need to pay more taxes back into the system so that there is a social framework to support the population as more and more jobs get replaced. Eventually just about any job could be automated, so we need to figure out what we do when that happens. It can't just be fuck that guy who used to do that job.
