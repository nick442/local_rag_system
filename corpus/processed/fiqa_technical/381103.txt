"> Everything isn't about you? I'm Ron Burgundy? > Do statistics only matter when they correlate directly to you? No, but they have to directly relate to *someone*! Median income represents no individual. These collective statistics are a meaningless metric when looking at providing a life for yourself and your family. These ""news"" articles are meaningless. What is the purpose here? The ""middle class"" is poorer! What does that even mean? What are you trying to say? This is nothing but a distraction, all to earn clicks to get ad money."
