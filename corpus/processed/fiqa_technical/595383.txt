It sort of sounds like you want to contradictory things: (1) to fix your credit so you will be able to get loans and (2) to have more money available to spend now. It sounds like the latter is probably not possible. Not without getting into a worse situation than you are currently in (based on what you have written the next step is payday loans and the like, which is basically financial suicide). Fixing your credit is simple. It's just not fun. Cut your spending. Cut it way, way, way down. You will certainly have to change your lifestyle. I'd suggest taking a second job. Make the minimum payment on everything, then put all your extra money toward the most pressing things: I would focus on the former. As you pay down your debt your utilization will go down, and this will raise your score automatically. When you pay off your highest interest rate debt, don't change your spending. Instead put everything you were putting to that to the next highest debt you have. Continue until your highest interest rate loan is at or below the mortgage rate. When you get to this point you will notice that your credit score is vastly better and you are no longer spending all your money on interest. You will probably be in a position to buy a home. And you will have the satisfaction of knowing you did it yourself, rather than having a bankruptcy judge force you to change your lifestyle. A note on the items in collections: make sure they are all legit. If any are wrong, it is pretty straightforward to contest them with the credit bureaus and get them taken off. Things in collections will drop your score severely.
