> That leaves those that want to ‘see’ outside of China via a phone needing to either jailbreak their iPhones.. No. You simply have to configure the VPN manually, or get an account on a non-Chinese App Store. I had no problem with using the USA App Store during my five years in China. Manual configuration is not difficult, and all of the VPN's have easy to follow instructions for the non-technically inclined. Granted, there's a bit of a chicken and egg problem wherein you often need a VPN to access a VPN's website, but people that are looking to circumvent aren't morons.
