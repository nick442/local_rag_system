If you place your emergency fund in your TFSA, you can withdraw it at any time (e.g. in an emergency), and then replace the withdrawn money in the next calendar year. Be careful there; you pay a hefty fine if you replace it in the current calendar year if this leads to an overcontribution. It's not an either-or thing, though. You could invest the money in a mutual fund inside your TFSA. I strongly recommend against this for your emergency fund, however. The whole point of an emergency fund is that you may need it immediately. So, keep it in an investment that you can liquidate quickly. Cash or very-near cash. While I obviously don't know your specific situation, I needed $10,000 within 24 hours and another $10,000 within two weeks during an emergency. In a world where you have large sums of money, you'd max out your RRSP and TFSA with investments and keep your emergency fund outside of both. But most of us aren't in that situation. In that case, it makes sense to use your TFSA for your emergency fund. I use some of my TFSA space for my emergency fund (savings account paying low interest, though people often like GICs) and some for investment (passive indexed stocks and bonds). Note that you need to pay taxes on your savings account interest, too, if held outside your TFSA and RRSP accounts.
