> They also regularly give interest at about 12% which is good when I read about interest rates in the US being around 7%, but I feel like since this interest is basically announced after 2 years, that 12% isn't as good as it seems. Interest is likely quoted annually, so it's not 12% for 2 years, but 12% for *each* year invested. > That basically means that money someone contributed in July 2010 will earn interest 2 years later in 2012! I just feel like that is not how it should be done, but you can correct me if I'm wrong. Extremely unlikely. It's inefficient and, furthermore, illogical and system-breaking. Under that, money just sits around uselessly wasting away from inflation as opposed to being invested. What is much more likely is immediate or *close* to immediate investment. Admin costs can be accounted for several ways, but rest assured are almost certainly drawn out in relatively even payments at a set interval.
