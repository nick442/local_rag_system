"This is regular income to you (unless you meet some very narrow health-related field exceptions.) There's no ""claiming of income"" by you, it should be included on your W-2 as regular income where it will be subject to employment and income tax. Think of it like a bonus. It will bump up your income and make it look like you earn more money (because you did). There's no special tax break for you or your employer for paying off your pre-existing student loans. Talk to your student loan servicer to find out how the extra money will affect your income-based repayment plan next year. They should be able to tell you, or at least estimate for you, how it will change your future payments. Armed with that knowledge you can then decide whether or not to take the money from your employer. Naively, it would seem dumb to turn down free money, but there are some weird incentives out there."
