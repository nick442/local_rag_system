It's the CEO's/company's choice. If they lose excellent people because of it, so be it. Honestly, I am sick of working with pot heads. Outside of their smoke breaks, they might get a couple hours or actual work done in a 8 hour work day while I am busting my ass subsidizing some of their work just to keep the place afloat. It doesn't help that I am salaried and end up staying 3 hours over on some days just to catch back up with my job.
