You're right but only in the fact she had kids which she can't afford. I feel the judgement, however, is naive and made at a distance. The point of the article was although she clearly works her ass off, to the point of working 80 hour weeks, she can't afford basic needs. You can point out she isn't working 80 hours now, she has always at least worked full time. Yet she couldn't support herself and two children. To me that's a failure on a collective level. It shouldn't be possible. For someone to want to work more than the full 40, and have to choose between rent and food is ridiculous. The only argument to be made for justification of this situation is 'the market'. The service industry employs a big chunk of the country. If the people whom they employ can't eek out a living then something should be done. Minimum wage has existed for many years now and is not controversial. If a wage can't support a worker, one should support raising that wage. Should we really immediately say she has kids she can't afford? Should that really be possible for someone who works as hard as the woman portrayed in this article? I don't support sterilization of the poor, and that's the logical conclusion of your accusation. The poor should not have kids, and I presume you feel that we should not support them with taxes. That is another topic, but if one can work more than full time, having kids should not be near impossible to afford. Rather than a type of welfare, let these people earn enough to exist at the very least.
