Millennials are sure as hell not 'less materialistic' then other generations. You're talking about post-millennials 'Gen Z'. Millennials are the children of the Boomers and as a result, share a lot of the similar characteristics. The problem with the Millennials is that they learned a lot of Boomer traits of their parents but have not been afforded the same economic opportunities as their parents where. Gen Y and the Boomers are surprisingly some of the most liberal of generations. However, both are incredibly materialistic whilst being socially progressive. Gen Z, the post-millennials, grew up post 2001, post GFC. As a result of this chaotic and traumatic world which they grew up in, they tend to prize stability more then the Boomers and Gen Y do. Gen Z are more interested in work being a means to a (hopefully) stable end whereas Gen Y, Boomers see work as being an essential part of their identity as an individual. Gen Z will take many things for granted having grew up with a black President and in a country with a growing awareness of social rights (e.g legalization of same sex marriage) and as a result, will not be as socially progressive as their preceding generations.
