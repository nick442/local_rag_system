How generally when there is a discussion over man-made climate change you'll see it presented as one person per side, when in actuality the scientific consensus is 97% in favor, 3% against? I'm not a climate scientist, so I look to the scientific community for answers. They have spoken. I take it you're not a scientific scientist, but have somehow concluded that those professionals are wrong?
