My point was not especially reliant on your personal experience; the point was that for many people it's not as simple a matter as just sucking it up and hiring a lawyer. It's great that you had the know-how and the funds to defend yourself when you were sued, but for many entrepreneurs this post could not be more relevant. I don't see a need to scorn an already distressed couple, regardless of what anyone thinks they should or shouldn't have done. Why not post about something that could help them out? After reading their story I can't see what else could be done other than what he is already suggesting. Any ideas?
