"Any time someone starts asking you to provide personal information, such as a birth date, it could very well be a scam. This is especially true if it's someone you don't even know. Be very careful about getting involved in such situations. There is always some kind of almost believable story to what the scammers tell you, and unless you're willing to look deeper into it then it's easy to get pulled in. On top of that, you have to ask yourself, ""why did they pick me for this?"", because that's the real question. You have no idea what else the software they're asking you to download might do that you wouldn't know about, but offering to pay you something is a good way for them to get you to bypass your own security by installing it yourself. If the offer sounds too good to be true or too easy, you have to question it, and in such cases, your best bet is to stay away from it altogether."
