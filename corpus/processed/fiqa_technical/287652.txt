"I wouldn't say that they are ""begging"" for it. Just realizing that there is a competitive advantage for the larger car companies. However that incentive is necessary for the large companies to invest in electric, and it is a great benefit for consumers as well. Most people can't afford a low cost electric car without the tax credit (not to mention a luxury item like a tesla). This brings the technology to a larger market share."
