I've flown American regularly for the past two years because it's the only carrier offering nonstops between Richmond, VA and DFW. Something is definitely up with them lately. After 18 months of nearly perfect on-time service (except for weather delays), four out of my last five flights with them have been delayed for maintenance issues, several for 2 hours or more.
