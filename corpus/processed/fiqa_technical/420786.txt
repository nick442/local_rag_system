Ah, Swedish cars. My old 240 had some of the most ridiculous electrical problems ever. It ate headlights and taillights like they were going out of style, and when one did go out, instead of lighting up the 'headlight' indicator, it would just light EVERY indicator up in the row (making it look like the car was about to explode). That being said, that thing went through hell and back. RIP.
