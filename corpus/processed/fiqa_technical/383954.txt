"To say it was horrendously mismanaged wouldn't even scratch the surface. It's as if they proprietors did no research into the market whatsoever. Indeed, there is a market for higher wealth gamblers. You know what they expect? **Comps**. You know what Revel refused to offer in the beginning? **Comps**. Somehow Revel billed itself as the upscale everyman's resort and that appealed to all of nobody and every room was $300 a night. No exceptions. Higher bankroll players aren't going to drop coin where they're not getting pampered and the smokers who want to camp in a penny slot pit couldn't light up. That leaves you.. middle income non-smokers who are coming to kick the tires and maybe lay by the beach? Younger adults who like to club, but don't have the rolls to session at the tables? Where's the profit in that? That was the original perfect storm of foolishness that set the tone for the rest of the property's lifespan. Don't forget that during their mad dash for casino patrons they unleashed a most ridiculous $100 ""rebate"" on slot play wherein if you lost $100 they'd refund your stake. The fine print (if there ever was any) was that they'd provide you with ten $10 slot play vouchers over the next 10 months. More opaque foolishness. Their poker room closed in the first year of operation. The place is beautiful, on prime real estate on north Absecon Island, and has untapped potential. The fact is the casino had promise if it had been run by halfway competent management from the outset. Atlantic City is not Vegas. It will never be Vegas. Trying to chase Vegas is, you guessed it, more foolishness."
