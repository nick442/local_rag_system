"Only relevant to those with fantasy economy teams. Seriously, Rand's fictional works never translate well into reality because, no matter how hard people try, that ""fiction"" element just can't be ignored. Test it yourself: Strip John Galt and his followers of everything they have which was created by or within the ""society"" they so revile, drop them in the desert -- and they'll all be dead of exposure and starvation in less than two weeks because they will be naked, without tools and without food. The only reason the libertarians get away with pushing their tripe as a rational philosophy is because no one will point out what it is wrong with their thinking. Why? Well, for most of my lifetime, their ""philosophy"" was considered nuttery in line with the John Birchers and so why bother. It's only with the ascendency of these billionaire-funded politicians that this crap thinking has become acceptable, and even then, only to them."
