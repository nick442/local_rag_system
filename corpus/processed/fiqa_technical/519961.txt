Do we need salespeople anymore? Do I need someone who may or may not know their shit when I can research online with various sources? Paying all these salespeople who come off as forcing a deal isn't what 2017 retail should be about. Go in your BB. Look at potential TV buyers ask questions. Then listen to the salespeople. We have Magnolia in BB around here and they actually know what they are talking about but most BB without them do not.
