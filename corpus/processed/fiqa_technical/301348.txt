No way dude. I hate grocery shopping. Always forgetting my reusable bags, looking for parking, people blocking the isles, long lines, making awkward small talk with the cashier, hauling heavy bags up the stairs.. I use Amazon Fresh now, and it is THE SHIT. Only complaint so far is the quality of produce, which now, with the Whole Foods acquisition, may improve for the better. Living in the future is awesome.
