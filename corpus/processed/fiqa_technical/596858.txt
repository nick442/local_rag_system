I work at a public accounting firm. It's in tax, but I know the audit side of the house pretty well as well. >Without public confidence in the profession, CPA firms wouldn't exist. It's truly an incentive to do a good job and continually gain confidence. They incidentally make money along the way. That's really the heart of the argument. During my schooling we talked about ethics pretty much constantly. In almost every state now, you're required to take a 3 credit hour ethics class prior to sitting for the CPA exam, and you're required to do continuing education. How much depends on the state, but 40-60 hours every three years is par for the course. Of those hours, typically 4-5 of them have to be approved ethics courses. There's also a whole litany of codes of conduct that a CPA must follow. For example, I, as a tax person am bound to follow the codes of conduct of: * The SEC * The PCAOB * The IRS * The AICPA * My State Board of Accountancy * My Firm A serious violation of any one of those codes can lead to a suspension of my license. e.g. I won't ever be able to work in public accounting again. As a profession, most of the CPA's that I've met are above board, but there will always be a few bad apples. On the audit side, the PCAOB (a government agency) audits all the public accounting firms that do assurance work something like every 3 years. The SEC can get involved as well if they think something fishy is going on.
