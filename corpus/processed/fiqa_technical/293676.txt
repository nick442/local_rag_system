Just my two cents. It depend. Since Bayers aspirin is already established and there is no R&D to recoupe. It's easy to sell while newer drug is less well known and vendor need to get their R&D money back and don't forget the cost of business such as filing with FDA. It can added up while generic drug basically just a receipt that anyone can cook up.
