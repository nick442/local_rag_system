That's a good point, and one I've recently been realizing too. I've been so focused on the aerospace and defense sector that I wasn't interested in anything else at first. Obviously I know now that's what has been causing my problems and I need to and have been changing my approach but it hasn't been successful yet, hence the post. But thanks for the advice, I had initially written off temp agencies (my temp job was through a friend not an agency) but now it looks like that may be one of my only choices at this point.
