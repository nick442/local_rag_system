Totally, right now I'm being stopped by the difficulty of adjusting from being a student with a flexible schedule to working 6 to 6, but it's definitely not for lack of time that I'm having trouble working out. You're right though, as the blog post mentions, you typically end up scheduling your gym appointments at times when you definitely won't be called in to the office - very late and very early on weekends. As for sleep, I used to be very dedicated to 8/night, but you learn to adjust to less. The impacts are noticeable, though, and it's certainly not ideal.
