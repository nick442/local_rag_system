Business owners or other people with a sales quota to meet will often often take that deal. Especially when there isn't a physical thing being sold. If the Yoga class has an open spot, why not let another person in and get the $20? The sales clerk at the front desk usually doesn't have the authority to give a discount like that and won't stick their neck out to do so without prior approval.
