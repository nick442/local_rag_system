"I researched 3 of the major corrections, the 1929 one, the tech bubble, and the housing bubble. The three things they all have in common was people were too complacent in their life, The world was doing pretty well at the time during at least 2 of those. I believe there will be another great war before a recession though. The world isn't fine right now and people aren't complacent. Now perhaps this only means right now"" and not the past 8 years before now though. But any major events happening in the world is taking a slow and steady pace, and the market is making tiny corrections as it goes along. People are accepting the fact the way the world works is rocky so past events wont affect future events if something major does happen. Another thing 2 out of the 3 I researched is they existed when people were taking advantage of something. Buying and reselling houses, creating websites and putting them on the stock market without any value. There are 2 things similar to that right now, phone apps/social networks, and crypto currencies(bitcoin etc). People are taking super advantage of those 2 things right now millionaires are popping out too easily. But if bitcoin and other crypto currencies crash I don't think it'll affect the rest of the market since they aren't a regulated currency. The phone apps and social networks aren't really being super over valued using the stock market in recent times either, with exception to snapchat. All in all, I'll I don't believe there will be another great market crash/recession for at least another 5-10 years."
