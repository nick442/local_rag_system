I appreciate it. I just responded to your post. I think you could have been..a bit nicer with your criticism at my post lol but I upvoted you and I don't think you should be downvoted for saying something that..definitely wasn't too far off the mark. I appreciate this response and message though and I just want you to know that I did read a lot of the links you sent - but I was looking for more detailed and personal information. I agree I worded my post quite poorly and it did come off as very naive and entitled. Thanks for the information! Edit: Ah well I thought you sent that as a message. Now my double replies just look super awkward..oops
