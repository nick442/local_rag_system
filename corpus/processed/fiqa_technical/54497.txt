I'd have to disagree on the overhead aspect here. Knowing what a family owned restaurant pays for rent, before the actual costs of the business comes in. Also, the city streets are not supposed to be a source of competition for their business. The owners find location, compare it to the competition in the area and take the risk. The curb is for parking cars, not putting up a mobile business. How can the brick and mortar restaurant factor in that kind of unknown competition when they open? I know, every one reddit feels they should be able to do what ever they want in all things, until it effects them personally, then they'll bitch about the unfairness of it. Your arguement is simple minded.
