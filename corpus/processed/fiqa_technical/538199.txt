If it was me, I would outsource as much as possible with the desire to receive up front payment from financing companies for originating a loan. Why? The biggest risk to newer businesses is cash flow. The amount of work a new business owner has to do is daunting. If you can outsource some of that work it will increase your chance of success and make your life easier. Focus on selling cars. The upfront origination will help with your cash flow. If you can outsource the credit decision making and paper work you have leveraged your time and can focus on more important things.
