The company had been through many rounds of private financing prior to that. There was a particular round where Mercedes Benz invested a lot of money which Elon credits with saving the company. Elon says that the company would probably have survived but just taken longer to get to market, or done so at a slower ramp, without the government money. Of course, he may be saying that for whatever PR reasons, but he's been pretty open about when the company was on the brink of death before, so I tend to believe it. Keep in mind, they had already made money on the Roadster prior to the government loan (not a lot, but had they not been spending on Model S R&D it would have produced a profit - but the whole intent to begin with was to fund Model S R&D with the Roadster). Also, the government loan was a loan, and that loan was paid back. I don't see people criticizing Nissan, for example, for taking government loans, even though theirs was 10x the size of Tesla's and has not yet been paid back (by the way, I also am not criticizing Nissan for that, I'm just saying neither should be criticized). Tesla, in fact, got the least money of any company out of that particular loan program. Including Fisker, who got more money despite having a worse business plan.
