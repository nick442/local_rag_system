> Are you aware that General Foods is strongly lobbying to mandate GMO labeling? That's odd since they haven't existed in that name since the 1990. > What folks here don't get is it's generally in the industries interest to not mislead. Bullshit. they will do whatever they can do that they think will increase the bottom line. if a company thinks that onerous labeling requirements would help their bottom line because they think they can use them to their advantage over other companies then they will push for it.
