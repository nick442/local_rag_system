Different focus and drive. Are you familiar with process improvement methods like Six Sigma? Yes they've become synonymous with corporate buzzword bullshit in the US but that's not the way it always was. During WWII the US government socialized many factories to support the war effort. They took statistics nerds and gave them factories to run. After the war the nerds were offered jobs in the census. Some of them went to other countries to help rebuild instead. There are statues to some of them because they helped Japan become a leading economy in relatively short order. China doesn't have that focus. They succeed out of sheer numbers. Not by refining process. That would require investing in their workforce too much and cheep disposable labor is the way they compete.
