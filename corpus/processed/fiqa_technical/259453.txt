"Lets put glib non-answers into perspective. - There is not a single number: how many wounds. Then, dividing the total per this value, you'd know a bit more. - They are generous in a lot of other percentages which, of course, mean crap without this. 5.8% of what? Is that 5 people shot, or 50000? - The % of people without insurance is interesting, but a far more interesting value would be: X of the value is uninsured, in Y of the wounds. Then you'd know whether uninsured wounds are costlier on average. - There is a 20 to 1 differential in 5000 to 100 000. Doesn't really tell us either average or median. - What cost is accounted? Cost first billed? Values actually paid? Accounting cost of the actual care? Same price measure for the ones insured, and the ones uninsured? A standardized cost per types of wounds? If an hospital charges 100000 for the same another asks 20000 for, its meaningless. Societal cost is one thing, the billing fantasies of the american health system another. If you fail to understand what is contained in what you read, and then again fail to understand when it is pointed out, then you do waste a lot of resources. For those that CAN read, you can see how a full article can be read and published that contains no real information or original thought or research about a problem, being useless to define it. Its a ""feel this"" piece, knowledge is optional."
