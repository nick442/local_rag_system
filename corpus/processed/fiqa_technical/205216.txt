> E.U. and the US produces some of the worlds best produce in terms of quality and quantity. Russia has no problem feeding their population. If they're cool with eating nothing but wheat and corn. From you saying this I assume you are in the US.. Having traveled all over the US and Russia I can tell you. Ether the US is exporting all its best food items and keeping lower quality for itself, or Russia already has access to better produce than the US has to offer.
