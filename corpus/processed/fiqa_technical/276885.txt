Productivity in industry has massively increased, self drilling screws aka modern fasteners, and modern materials. CNC machines with one person making a complete product in one hit that took ten people ten operations on ten machines to do in the past. The modern technique of _'lean production'_ gets a poorly paid CNC operator to take a raw casting, machine it into a finished product in one CNC operation, wash and oil THEN box the part up next to the machine. Its a complete one person production line at $10 ph.
