I'm no expert on AI but I did take a few classes on it during my CS degree. One of the first things we learned was that Neuroscience, or Cognitive Neuroscience, is an intrinsic part of AI and has been since the early days. So the part of this article that implies this is a new idea seems incorrect. If you're going to build an AI, you won't make it very far without a definition for intelligence or what it is to *think* (this turns out to be hard.)
