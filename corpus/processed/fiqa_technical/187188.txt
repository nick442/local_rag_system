> The prize pool for the 2014 International was over $10M raised by fans of the video game, greater than golf's 2014 Masters which paid out $9M. Which is very interesting.. but also guilty of selection bias. You're looking at the one video game tourney ever to have this purse against a single golf event, which is actually part of a year long series of events with large purses. In fact, the Master's is something like the 6th largest purse in golf.
