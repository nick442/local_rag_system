When did I ever mention the constitution? Ever considered that I'm not even American? So basing my arguments on your constitution wouldn't make sense to me. Capitalism is barter. You don't neither need government enforcement nor centralized currencies. In fact that's what anarcho-capitalists always were speaking out against. Capitalism does not require maintenance and there's this thing called private schools, loans and private security (I'm no ancap, I'm just saying..) And even you yourself did not dare to put healthcare in that list apparently. Are you seriously going to base your arguments on a game that has a maximum of 12 pieces, a single branch of business and limited amounts of money? Go ahead, it's past midnight but even sleepy me realizes that that's a terrible idea.
