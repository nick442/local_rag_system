Someone on twitter (I'm forgetting who, but not just a random person) upon seeing Apple drop it said that we'd be 5 years away from self-driving cars for the next 50 years. Thought it was a ridiculous response considering Apple clearly hasn't been committed to this. Not to mention all the plans car manufacturers have and all the progress Google has made.
