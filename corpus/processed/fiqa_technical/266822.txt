Would you like me to add fake experiences or to throw assumptions into my evaluation? If someone has one experience with a company, that is all they have to base their opinion off of. I'm not sure how a lack of abundant personal preference subdues the value of the anecdote as a whole. Also, I haven't ever used either, I would not pay for a ride when I can always provide it myself or a find a free one. I'm referring to which I'd rather be employed by.
