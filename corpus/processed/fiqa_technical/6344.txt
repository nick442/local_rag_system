The conventional wisdom is that there has been little inflation which seems weird to me because it was only about ten years ago that a typical coke machine took coins and charged about 50 cents, a loaf of bread could be had for 35 cents at Aldi and gas was about $1.50 per gallon. I'm 43 and the cost for just about everything has about tripled since I was a kid. Minimum wage was $3.15 when I was a teenager. Now it's $7.25 The other day I got a bottle of Pepsi at Dunkin Donuts and the cashier didn't even blink when she told me it was $2.08
