Yes, if you notice that 98% of your black employees like fried chicken it is still racist to say black people like fried chicken. What if you lived in NYC and been mugged five times. Each time was a black person. Would you still think it wasn't racist to say that black people are criminals? Look, making a generalization about an entire race based on a few people (regardless of your personal experience) is racist. Very few stereotypes come completely from nowhere, Asians being good at math is a sterotype, but the fact is a large proportion of Asian countries focus a lot of effort on math education. But assuming someone who is Chinese is good at math because they are Chinese is racist. Because you're making an assumption about an individual based on nothing more than their race (this particular Chinese person might hate math, might have been raised in a country with poor math education, so on and so forth). And this carries into sexism as well. Hiring women or not isn't what makes you a sexist. Assuming that because someone is a woman she will gossip or cause drama is what makes you a sexist.
