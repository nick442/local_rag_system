"It's not expensive to me, but for the type of people who NEED to eat fast food often you can get a small burger, fries and a soda for $3 ($2.50 for a kids meal) vs. a Chipotle burrito and drink for ~$8. That really adds up for large families or people who have fast food every day. Heck, Taco Bell will sell you a burrito (and a case of indigestion) for 69 cents. I won't even go into how variety plays a part in all this. McDonald's model is to be all things to all people and have them eat as many meals as possible there. Places like Chipotle are cool with sharing a percentage of the slightly more affluent ""now and then"" fast food crowd with other niche places like Noodles & Company, Five Guys, and whatnot. I'm not dissing Chipotle and their business model, but it's just a completely different market than the big mega fast food chains and it drives me nuts when they are directly compared."
