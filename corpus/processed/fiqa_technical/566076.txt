For anyone looking to move to a better webhost, you will find many, many webhosting companies that are offering better deals, better service, and more up to date servers than GoDaddy. I can recommend a couple of companies for hosting. For your basic, economy hosting on solid hardware - http://www.serenity-networks.com/ is quite awesome. If you're hosting a site that demands serious performance and is PHP based, http://www.simplehelix.com/ SimpleHelix specializes in high performance PHP and e-commerce sites. Both will walk you through transferring a domain from GoDaddy. Both will migrate your site for free. Both are backed by 24/7 tech support. Happy trails.
