So 2015 is still well before the Model 3 is coming out, so they will still be dealing solely in Model S and Model X, which both carry an average transaction price approaching six figures. Mercedes and BMW both produce around 60,000 of their similarly priced level vehicles (S class and 7 series respectively) per year. Audi produces around 35,000 8 series vehicles. The point here is that if Tesla is planning on selling 100,000 vehicles in a market that is around 200k cars per year, that would represent a HUGE chunk out of the near-six-figure luxury vehicle market, and would require a non-insubstantial percentage of people to switch away from long-entrenched marques. It will be highly impressive if they pull it off.
