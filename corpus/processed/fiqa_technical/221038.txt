Between this and the FBI raid of the Yeshiva school getting a $1.2 million dollar grant for computers (When their children are forbidden from using them). Their incessant drive trying to get homeowner's in Tom River to close all cash so they can move in, their disgusting attitude towards women (not being able to sit next to a woman on El Al airlines), their pedophilic elders who molest children in bathhouses in Brooklyn, the East Ramapo school district takeover and their isolationism towards members of other community that they live beside, these types disgust me. It's not anti-Semitic, it's fuck these people in particular. Extremism of any religion is terrible.
