"Keep in mind that when you brand a truck, on the road it's advertising your business, but when it's sitting in the driveway, unattended at night, it's also a sign to people that ""Hey, I'm filled with lots of expensive tools, come break into me!"" Use caution. The contractors I know all avoid branding on their vehicles for this very reason."
