Of course, there is no way for us to know whether or not the clerk is trying to rip you off $1.29 at a time, but I can't understand the possible motivation for doing so. I would imagine that most people would catch this at some point, so for a store to consistently overcharge for something like this is really bad for business. They would be risking upsetting a customer all for the potential gain of $1.29. I have to assume that it is not malice, but incompetence. We don't know what caused the clerk to be confused, but it is not really our concern. From what I can tell, you've gotten the right price in the end. You were ultimately charged for two drinks, and the extra $1.29 that you were charged was refunded. Since it happened three times, you have to decide how badly you want these drinks in the future. If you choose to return, you'll just have to expect the possibility that it will ring up incorrectly, and you'll have to get it fixed. If that seems like too much hassle, then don't return to this store.
