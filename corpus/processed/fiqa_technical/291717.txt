You don't need a book, you need to dig into the business and understand what has changed. How long has there been a struggle to make ends meet? What seasonality exists for the business? Look at the period-over-period change for each product category as well as each line item expense, and find correlations that may exist. If it's possible, find similar insights about competition -- both brick-and-mortar as well as online. It's important to analyze the results of the business to understand (1) the normal ebbs and flows of the jewelry store seasonality, and (2) any erosion of the business to online or brick-and-mortar competitors. The other important takeaway is that you have to identify any changes in the business' expenses. Are utilities suddenly taking up more of a share of the profits, or are the costs of raw materials on the rise? Look at the cash flow to see where the money is going, or if there is a revenue problem. If business is down (and revenue as a result), you know where to start. Perhaps the answer is marketing or providing additional products or services that better match the needs of the clientele who are dropping off (i.e., online ordering and free shipping), or product pricing is elevated above the competition. On the other side, if expenses have gotten out of control, you know where to apply controls. Keep in mind that these are not mutually exclusive, and the business could have a revenue and an expense problem. If you've studied economics, you have the skills to understand the numbers and drive out the answers, but this problem requires application and not philosophy, sociology, or economics. No single book can give you the step by step process. Every business is unique, and no one but your family can provide the insights necessary to analyze the results. Best of luck!
