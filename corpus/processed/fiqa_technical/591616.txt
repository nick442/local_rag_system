"The (U.S) ""accredited investor"" laws apply to investments in the U.S. Foreign countries may or may not have their own laws regarding investment in startups, and if so, the foreign laws apply. One way around the net worth minimum is to be a member of the management team. ""Active"" (management) investors don't need to be accredited because they can see what's going on on a day to day basis. The accredited investor laws apply to the target companies, not to the investors. Basically, a start-up company can't take ""other people's money"" from a non-accredited investor. But you can invest ""your own"" money in it if you are a manager."
