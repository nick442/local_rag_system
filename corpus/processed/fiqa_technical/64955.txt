Even regardless of what's used to make the batteries, as soon as they are in use, and unless they are failing at an exponential rate, the offset of carbon begins as soon as you drive it instead of a gasoline powered vehicle. Gasoline transport and storage is IMMENSELY more energy and carbon pollution intensive than pure electric generation. It's like full on industry propaganda to argue otherwise. It's the same vein as Fox News watchers that still believe Obama was a muslim or born in Kenya, because they trust(ed) a voice on tv. Marketing and PR versus rational consideration and open research.
