can you give us some more information? consumer based product? b2b type product? does it have an end user (ie dropbox) or does it somehow integrate two things (ie you found a way for a photocopier to email someone when a printing job's done)? saas? web based? phone based? desktop based? who would be purchasing it? it departments? end users? parents? who would the end user be? executives? customer service people? teenagers? is it something that needs critical mass (reddit, facebook) to really take off? do you have any people that can be beta / test clients? not asking for specific details of where the treehouse is located, but would help to broadly know the type of forest it's in :)
