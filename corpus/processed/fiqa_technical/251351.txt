"How about #9 - Honesty? A lack of honesty between you and your employees can destroy your morale and increase turnover. If you're laying employees off, don't sugar coat and lie about why it's happening, just be straight forward - ""Times are tough, we need the money so we make the quarterly earnings and meet shareholder expectations"" - not ""We're re-aligning our core competencies to better focus on our mission statement"" If you've ever had a boss outright lie to you and you knew it was a lie, you immediately lose respect for them and your perception of them is changed forever."
