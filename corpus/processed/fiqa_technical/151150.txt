I believe that the same message could be sent without shutting the company and putting thousands of people on unemployment and hurting shareholders. Dissolving the company would only hurt everyone except the people responsible who almost certainly have golden parachutes in their employment contracts. How about penalizing them by assessing an extra cyber-breach tax on their revenues? Or seizing stock options and assets of the top level execs and only releasing portions after X many months without a security breach? Or use the fines to fund an initiative that companies need to be bonded against data loss with the rates set by security experts doing audits on the companies? There are plenty of ways to improve the situation without putting them out of business. At the very worst, the company should be put up for sale to be taken over by a holding company that can manage the process of bolstering their security instead of just liquidating assets which would only hurt the innocent bystanders in the incident.
