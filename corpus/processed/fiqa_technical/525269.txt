Ya that is really weird. I have a local bar I eat/drink at least once a week and depending on total, I'll tip 30-100% (if it's a daily special and only $10 total, I'll just leave a $20). These people become known on a first name basis and are pleasant and helpful. Stiffing them or even being cheap comes off really poorly. We're only taking $5-10 more to make someone's day better. (And usually they'll give you freebies!)
