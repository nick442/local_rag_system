I don't have subscription myself, but I know somebody who does. I think it is actually pretty expensive what they do. They have millions of old records from all over the world scanned and digitized. Somebody has to go to all the archives, request the documents and scan them in. They have records that are hundresds of years old and you won't find otherwise on the internet.
