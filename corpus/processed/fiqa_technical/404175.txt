Bitfinexnetwork is a portfolio management program headquartered in London (UK). We already have a plant set-up that mines ethereum and G-CAS. Our plant or mining pool is in China. We mine crypto currencies and trade them further. People buy servers and lease back to us. When they lease them back, we offer them to participate in the output that we receive in the form of ‘’fixed returns’’. Bitfinexnetwork is India’s first portfolio management program that has a physical presence in sec 63, Noida. To maintain transparency among our members, anyone is allowed to come and meet us and have complete knowledge about the crypto world. We have taken official API from Bitfinex.com for trading purpose. Just to clarify, this is the only relationship between Bitfinex.com and Bitfinexnetwork.com. Our goal is to make mining and trading accessible to all users regardless of age, location, investment, technical nouse or experience. We want to give our customers an opportunity to try out cryptocurrency mining and earn Bitcoin as a reward. On a larger scale, we hope to contribute to the development of mining services and subsequently to the development, establishment and adoption of Bitcoin both as a currency and as an economic system
