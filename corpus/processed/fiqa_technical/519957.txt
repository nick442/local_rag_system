"To be fair, Kodak has always been at the forefront of Digital photographic technology - this article seems to paint a picture of a company which has taken its foot off the accelerator, as opposed to a much more typical scenario of the company that *develops* the technology almost never being the one which successfully *exploits* it. 20 years ago Kodak invented the Photo-CD - ahead of its time in many ways, it basically flopped as the mass market was not really technically prepared to be able to use the format - it ended up gaining at least a fair level of acceptance among professional photographers.. in 1975 the first digital camera (as noted) was built using then-new CCD image sensor technology at Kodak Eastman by engineer Steven Sasson - a decade later Kodak scientists developed the world's first MegaPixel sensor, capable of producing a photo-quality 5x7"" print, in 1986.. the first camera to use Compact-Flash - a format still popular today - was the Kodak DC-25 in 1996.. in 2000 Kodak teamed up with Qualcomm to develop the core technologies for the creation of high-quality digital cinema systems - to give credit where it is due, Sony has largely been the driving force behind digital cinema for the last ten years.. in 2001 Kodak introduced the EasyShare digital camera and (in 2003) printer dock, allowing many households to finally enter the Digital age Kodak had promised a decade earlier with the Photo-CD - solid-state storage technology such as Compact-Flash by now basically replacing the CD as the preferred medium.. it also launched the first Digital Photo Frame around the same time - the ""Smart Frame"" licensed to Kodak by Weave Innovations, it could download images from Weave's online Story Box network, or you could load images onto it via Compact-Flash.. in 2005 Kodak launched the EasyShare Photo Printer 500, for use with virtually any brand of digital camera and recently introduced camera phones, and in 2006 it entered into partnership with Motorola for purposes of global cross-licensing and marketing around mobile imaging products - in 2007 it had a similar arrangement with Sony-Ericsson and in 2008 introduced the world's first 1.4micron 5 Megapixel sensor - developed specifically for mobile phones.. I think it is a mistake to categorise Kodak as a company which ""couldn't foresee a future in which film had no role in image capture"" or, as an early adopter of internet and online distribution one that is ""dependent on outdated distribution technologies"" and while it is true that ""consumer demand for Kodak's traditional products has evaporated"" it is also equally true that Kodak has expanded its interests far beyond those traditional products - from printing and long-lasting dye technologies, to photo frames and the development and patenting of OLED technology, through to the ""Easyshare"" philosophy of connecting cameras and phones and printers and even those frames to wirelessly share your digital photos - even to being involved in the Mars Rover project and developing CCD technology for Space - this is a company which may not be pulling in the major profits of days gone by, but it is *not* from a lack of foresight! Either way, it is rather sad they became such a minor player in a market they helped create."
