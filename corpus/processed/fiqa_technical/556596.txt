I really have backed it up with facts and not really just something I think is true. There has been more precipitation and more grain crops and generally more vegetation which in turn means more oxygen. That you can't disagree with. I say that is a good thing. The only reason early primates evolved was when CO2 levels and oxygen levels were doubled during the Eocene epoch. You may say humans evolving was a bad thing for the planet and that's something we can agree on. Anyways we shouldn't tax CO2, but rather SO2 and other pollutants. It's OK, I also disagree, vehemently, with your opinion.
