Investment in public infrastructure is different than subsidy to private companies. Comparison to the interstate system here is irrelevant. The state of Wisconsin is giving a company $230k per worker per year in tax breaks for jobs that will pay the workers $53k per year. There is no tax rate that can earn that investment back for the state. In fact, that state income tax rate on these salaries is 6.27%. Even considering all of the additional jobs that will be created for construction and as an effect of having a large employer in the area, this investment will never pay for itself in terms of taxes generated.
