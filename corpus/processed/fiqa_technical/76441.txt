">I do have to say, that this is certainly not an influence of ""creeping socialism"" but rather ""creeping corporate welfare-ism"" No there is definitely an aspect of using ""socialistic"" concepts/memes here (is it in an utterly misleading and false manner, yes.. but it's still there nonetheless). >if socialism was the culprit, we'd be actually doing something to alleviate the suffering of babies and kittens. as it stands, we are just contributing to outrageous corporate bonuses. ?"
