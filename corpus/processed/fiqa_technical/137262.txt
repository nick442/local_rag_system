Public Securities Association Standard Prepayment Model is what the acronym psa stands for. My understanding is that it allows for adjustments in monthly pre-payment amounts, which will then affect the yield of the bond. Not really sure what the most important bond measure would be.. but if I had to guess I'd say its the mechanical bond price/ bond yield relationship. Yields go down, prices go up and vice versa.
