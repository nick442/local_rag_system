Oh god, you're one of *those* people. Normally I don't feed trolls but I'm bored today, so here goes: First, [mfw I ask for peer reviewed literature and you respond with blog posts, newspaper articles and links to independent.co.uk](https://media.giphy.com/media/WzE8jeKrQ3FNS/giphy.gif) Now, to business. I'm not going to address what's discussed in the editorialized versions of the stories you shared - they are just journalists' take on a few studies. Instead, I'll address the study itself which I'm guessing you didn't bother to read. **First study you (indirectly) linked:** >The results weren’t what we expected, but they tie in with previous research on addiction, which has found that substance abusers – people who are dependent on cocaine or amphetamine, for example – have altered dopamine systems. I'm not exactly seeing how that proves your point. Of course chronic drug addicts are not going to be productive members of society but nobody is debating that >It could also explain the ‘amotivational syndrome’ which has been described in cannabis users, **but whether such a syndrome exists is controversial.** So this very study casts doubt on the phenomena you describe >We only looked at cannabis users who have had psychotic-like experiences while using the drug. Hmm, hardly seems like these results should be applied to the general population of all cannabis users then. **Second Study you (indirectly) linked:** >It has also been proposed that long-term cannabis users might also have problems with motivation even when they are not high. **However, we compared people dependent on cannabis to similar controls, when neither group was intoxicated, and did not find a difference in motivation** So this study literally disproves the core tenant of your overall argument. Thanks for the link. **Third article you linked:** is shit. It doesn't give us details on the study no a link to the research, it just cherry picks a few quotes. Thankfully, it does refer to the same research linked in your fifth article, which I'll discuss shortly. But seriously kid, you didn't bother to actually read any of these did you? **Fourth study you (indirectly) linked:** is literally the same study referenced in the second article. You didn't read any of these, did you? **Fifth study you (indirectly) linked:** as I said before, it's the same research discussed in the third link. And here's the really important part: >..we do not purport to report a causal relation- ship between cannabis dependence and economic/social problems; cannabis dependence could be a marker of a life trajectory characterized by social and economic adversity You do know the difference between correlation and causation, right? But seriously, this was actually a really good bit of research that I enjoyed reading and it does bring up a few points that support your point of view. If you can be bothered reading articles that don't have pictures, give this one a shot! **Sixth study you (indirectly) linked:** again, pretty hard to discuss because the Denver Post did not bother to include a link to the research itself. But again, I think you're confusing correlation with causation. All this article proves is that, like cigarette use, marijuana use is more strongly concentrated among lower-income Americans. There is no claim that marijuana use *caused* these people to earn less money. That's your own opinion and it's not supported by any facts. **Now, where is that bitch slap you mentioned?**
