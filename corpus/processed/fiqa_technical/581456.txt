I agree, and this is as someone who has a hobby project idea that he might someday want to build as a product and sell. I just don't think I would ever follow the conventional start-up model. It stakes too much on too little. It's better to construct a sustainable small business with a product line and revenue model, and also keep most of the ownership yourself, rather than get suckered into gajillion-dollar start-up offices, big-deal conventions and conferences, big-deal ownership of your company by VCs, big-deal coroporate folks suddenly walking around like they own the place.. for a product that will end up relying on advertising for revenue or costing $10.
