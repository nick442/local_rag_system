This has been rehashed many times over, you should not have a family of three if you are on minimum wage. You can't afford a Mercedes lease on the minimum wage does that mean you should increase it? No. You simply make decisions to support your lifestyle, don't bring three kids(or significant other and a kid, either way not relevant) into your life if you can't support yourself. edit: Was expecting downvotes, I suggest you take a basic Economics class.
