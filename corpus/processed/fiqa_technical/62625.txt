This article addresses a man who specifically lost his skilled work to outsourcing to India. No one is talking about dishwashing level work here, that's more relevant to ILLEGAL immigration, and the practice of hiring illegal labor off the books by businesses. Jobs that people don't want should pay more. That' supply and demand, the free market. Janitors makes $15-30/ hr, more than easier low wage jobs. Maids make $25-60/hr. Garbage men make $20-60/hr. Illegal people do it for less because they don't have full rights as citizens, and thus have less leverage to negotiate pay. Their pervasiveness gives legal citizens less leverage to negotiate their pay. I think the honest solution to illegal immigration is to seek ways to make legal immigration and naturalization more reasonably accessible while also cracking down on illegal hiring practices. I DONT think the solution is to reserve our less desirable work to a slave class of any sort. I'm not for unions, but the negotiating power and well being of the American labor force should be protected always. If the pay reflects the labor, people will do the work. Blue collar Americans do all sorts of disgusting, difficult, and/or dangerous work as long as it is at a premium. This article is more about the negotiating power of americans lost to corporations taking skilled work and outsourcing it ~~at minimum wage levels of employment~~ (article said $60k or more) to those desperate for a living wage and/or citizenship. How to address that, I don't know. Edit:not min wage, $60k
