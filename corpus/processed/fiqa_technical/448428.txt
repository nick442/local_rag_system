> Or are there multiple ways of buying a company? Yes, there are, and it would depend on your contextual definition of what it means to buy a business. If you were intending to acquire a company by being its majority shareholder (i.e. >50% equity stake), then you would have to buy over its shares from existing shareholders at a negotiated price (read: not necessarily book value) to attain the desired shareholding. However, buy a business could also refer to an asset purchase, where the target's fixed assets are bought by the acquirer, in which case the target equity might not necessarily be involved in the acquisition.
