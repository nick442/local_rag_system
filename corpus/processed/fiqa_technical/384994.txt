"Yes and No. Almost everybody wants to own their own business. And they would gladly piss away an investor's money trying to make it happen. It's not just FUNDS that are required. I'm sure we both know some people that should not start a business of their own, no matter how it's financed. One of the big barriers to starting a business is regulation. We all want products that are safe to use and produced responsibly, but if the regulations are such that only a handful of the largest companies are capable of compliance, then those companies can be assured they will never have any credible competition. Regulation is a very careful balancing act. But your question wasn't ""What stops new businesses new businesses from forming?"" You asked what creates more business owners. A lot of that is actually cultural. To be a business owner you have to have a lot of specific personality traits that most people don't have. You have to be motivated to work hard, passionate about what you want to do, organized enough to approach it consistently, analytical enough to create a solid business plan that makes sense, and rational enough to know when to quit if it's not working. Finally (and this is a big one) you have to be able to **sell** that passion to investors, prospective customers and your first employees. The best widget in the world won't sell if it's being marketed by someone who doesn't know how to market things. What we need to do is find a way to provide consulting and resources to people who are developing those skills."
