Time value of money means it's a no brainer: if it doesn't cost you anything extra (ie. Interest) then you pay over time. You must pay it. It is not optional. You won't be able to fight it and win. Someone paid taxes in your behalf and you are obligated to reimburse them. Not paying is a great way to trigger a foreclosure. You will be considered in default of your mortgage if you do not pay them.
