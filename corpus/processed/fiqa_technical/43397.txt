">Fully half of the universe is making mediocre money, and no one talks about them. All anyone ever speaks of is CEO's and fund managers printing fucking billz. No shit. Just like most people with computer degrees, and in statistics, and engineering. But for some reason only finance has these problems? >Literally anything else. Programming is better, statistics is better, engineering is better. Fuck - go learn a trade. Even ignoring the outsized pay they are receiving, you can typically work for yourself, and you actually create shit The millions of consulting and banking employees are humored that you think it'd be better for them to plunge toilets. But at least you admit they're paid better and you just don't ""like"" the field. >AND you dont have to spend 100K (SEC numbers) on a fucking degree. 100k? Mine was <10. Most people's are in the SEC outside of Vandy and the morons who are out of state. They're some of the the best value in the country, given you actually get good grades and get a real job. To summarize, you've done nothing but rant about how much you don't like the field, admitted they make a lot more, provided no real rationale why someone should not pursue this degree/field, and your suggestion is to be a Carpenter instead. Just for more background, I'm a math/statistics major, one of your preferred options. Yea, get the fuck out of here."
