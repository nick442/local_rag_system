Why should capital gains be taxed at a lower rate than labor? It is because the tax code is really a philosophical tool (while also raising the revenues required to fund the government). I get to vote for federal, state and local representatives. The constitution is a Federal system. That should be sufficient reason for 100% of the conservative movement -- Trumpists exist in a separate category, but their share of the electorate dwindles with every tweet.
