Boom-bust economic cycles and asset bubbles have been happening for hundreds of years. And they take years or decades to work out, eg Long Depression from 1870-1890. Nothing is different this time. Therefore I am surprised people think the housing recovery is right around the corner. I don't think the conditions exist for the type of housing recovery people expect. Asset bubble, high unemployment, low wages and aging work force = economic stagnation. Maybe for the rest of my working life.
