>does it have growth prospects? Exactly this. There's no reason to believe that Facebook will grow enough to support that price tag. This is something that any company that becomes large relative to the market has to deal with. Demand becomes limited by the size of the market. Even after absorbing/destroying competitors there just isn't that much more room for growth. Facebook's pricing will hopefully be a bit of a wake-up call. We don't need another dotcom bust. Facebook might be very valuable but you're kidding yourself if you think it is more valuable than a company like UTC for example.
