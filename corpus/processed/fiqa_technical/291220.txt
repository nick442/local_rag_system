"With debts exceeding assets by a billion dollars, this activity likely comes from penny stock speculators and ""pump and dump"" schemers. There is no rational expectation that the stock is even worth multiple pennies when the company is that far upside-down on its debts.

Shareholders are at the bottom of the totem-pole when debts are being adjusted by the courts."
