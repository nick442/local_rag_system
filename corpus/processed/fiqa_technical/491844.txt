My job cut everyone's hours to 30 (it was 40-45) so they could avoid it. Luckily I'm still under 25 so I'm able to get under my dads health plan. I'll be over the age limit next December so I plan on picking up a side gig. Maybe she can consider her parents plan or a side gig? Sorry to hear about her predicament. It's a funked up situation.
