Tesla isn't *that* new. Their roadster has been around for more than 8 years. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Roadster#History 8 Years is more than enough time to work out the bugs. Given the price and all of the media hype, I'd expect the Model S to at least *match* the experience of owning a BMW or a Lexus.
