The main reason for an UBI is to provide atleast some sort of income since a lot of people are projected to be out of a job due to automation. Hence that source of income, for the large part, will go to the basic needs first, like housing, power, food. Atleast, that's what I suspect. So if a landlord knows people can afford atleast X amount for housing, why would they offer it any cheaper?
