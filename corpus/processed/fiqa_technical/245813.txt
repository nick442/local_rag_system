Note: This is what one of the people responsible for this process told me quite a few years ago, it might be different today. I work in insurance, but I don't follow this particular process too closely. New cars necessitate a judgment call, which usually involves a look at claims rates for similar (existing) cars, manufacturer-specific labour and parts costs, expected regional distribution (for example, a new BMW will probably sell better in Bavaria than in other areas, which has higher labour rates than most of the rest of the country, and will be categorised accordingly), and other factors, depending on the situation. These preliminary judgments are largely discarded when the new statistics are compiled, though, which is once a year. New insurance groups are published in early September and usually applied to insurance contracts on January 1st.
