Basically the idea is you put the exact amount of cash into each envelope and set those aside for a specific purpose. Then when you go to accomplish that specific purpose such as grocery shopping or whatever, you take the corresponding envelope and use only the money that is inside. It is sort of a way to train yourself to follow budgets very strictly. Many people stand by this method and it really is as simple as the website you linked to. As far as tracking, this method really doesn't track anything aside from what you note down about where the money is going. Others have moved on to using ING sub accounts to do the same thing but in a digital form.
