"Here's the story of EDI: EDI is between a Vendor and Customer. Despite EDI being about standards, the truth is that the Customer is the bully and the Vendor is the wimp. So, for every trading partner, you need a unique EDI process. In this particular case, inbound invoices from a supplier, the Supplier is huge, and despite us being the ""Customer"", we had to comply with their ""standard"".
