>I don't think we'll actually pay for shows, we're way too cheap to do that People pay for cable and itunes. People go to the movies and spend quite a bit. They (mostly) complain when they feel they don't get value for what they pay for. On Reddit many people have written about how the are (more or less) forced to torrent Game of Thrones, but will be happy to buy the Blurays when available. Not every show is GOT, but that is what people will look and pay for happily. Advertisers will pay (a lot) for shows that attract the 'right' types of viewers. News programs attract older viewers, so drug companies see those shows as opportunities. The Super Bowl attracts everyone, but mostly 18 to 49 year old males, so beer and car companies find it attractive. I can't see the Super Bowl ever being a pay-on-demand event, but it could be. If people want no commercials, or extra commentary, better graphics, higher definition, and the list goes on. People schedule parties and events around the Super Bowl, so of course they will pay for its content. >We have total information overload I can't agree there. 50 years ago one could turn on the radio, TV, see a movie, or go to the library, and be fully occupied. Adding the internet doesn't really 'create' overload. I have friends who choose not to own a cellphone and/or a TV. They find the expense/wasted time is not a priority in their lives. I have a TV, but I only turn it on once or twice a week (a shame really, it's a beautiful 42 incher). I think your point is advertisers are finding advertising to a large captive group is increasingly hard. I'll agree with that. The average 18 year old has already seen a million ads, so in modern urban life it's no wonder that most people tune out most advertising. Advertisers now have good ways of targeting their dollars, I don't see broadcast TV as an efficient use of those dollars.
