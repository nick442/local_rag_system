I've had 50% raise offers before. Start ups might pay more to attract talent but you look at what they are doing and realize they will probably be out of cash flow once the venture capitalist money dries up. If you like changing jobs sure. I've been at the same company for 12 years. My salary has gone up 4x since I started so whatever. It's just easier. I know one of my offers went out of business in less then 8 months..
