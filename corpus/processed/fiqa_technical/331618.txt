I'm aware that this is not how modern economics works. I considered pursuing a graduate degree in the subject, but chose not to because I disagree with the epistemological foundations of the approach. My ideas aren't based in explicit observation of reality, as I prioritize reason above observation. The difference between the two approaches is similar to the difference between pure mathematics and applied mathematics, where the rationalist (my perspective) is pure math, and the empiricist (the modern economist) is applied math. If you would include the theorems and abstractions of pure mathematics as fantasy, then my ideas are indeed based in fantasy, but you'd then have to explain why such an approach is wrong given how often the seemingly useless work of pure math ends up proving highly valuable in the long run (e.g. number theory and computer science).
