Yes that is not an unusual number. In some states the state tax rate is fairly flat, and unless you are highly paid the social security and medicare taxes are also flat. The big issue is the federal number. Several things can make make the federal taxes for the early paychecks larger than normal. later checks will include these pretax amounts which will reduce the taxable income, and the taxes. Though the net check will get smaller. Keep in mind that the size of the checks your first year are impacted by the fact that most recent graduates start in the summer. The tax tables assume that each of the paychecks you receive will be essentially the same. For those recent graduates the 1st real paycheck dwarfs the average paycheck for the first part of the year. This can put you in a higher bracket than you should be, and result in a large refund when you file in the spring. You can adjust your withholding numbers after a few checks to counterbalance this. Of course the numbers will need to be changed back in year two to to avoid under withholding.
