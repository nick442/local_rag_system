"Concealing parts of a document in order to obtain a signature is illegal. The company committed signature forgery because they effectively modified the document after you signed it (i.e. unfolded the parts that were previously folded). I suggest that you go to your local police department to file a report, citing ""signature forgery"". Once you have the police report, call your bank's fraud department (not the general billing dispute line) and cite the police report right away, specifically calling out ""signature forgery"". I would be surprised if you don't get a favorable outcome."
