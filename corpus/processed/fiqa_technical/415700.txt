It's been particularly low the past couple months though.. and I'm talking futures a couple months out too. 5 years is about the cycle length for significant VIX change too. I do believe though that the prominence of algo trading and other high speed trading has made prices less volatile though. But at this level and, more importantly, with so many people short VIX: it's a bit worrisome here.
