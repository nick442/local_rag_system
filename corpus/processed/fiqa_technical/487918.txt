I don't believe most do it on purpose. Its a function of two things. 1) Markets are relatively efficient, so generating profits off of publicly available information is rare. 2) Analysts cannot ethically nor legally make recommendation based on material non-public information. That leaves them with using public information and building out s model to estimate earnings and therefore share price as best as possible. The problem is that estimating earnings is notoriously difficult. Every model is subject to garbage-in-garbage-out. All analysts start with some of the same basic assumptions and then tweak them based on their best guess. Take enough analysts and you've now replicated roughly what all investors are doing in the marketplace, meaning as a whole analysts won't be more accurate than the market. The only way to generate above market returns is for you to consistently pick the analyst with the right recommendation. If only it were so easy.. Furthermore, analysts tend to make similar recommendations due to biases. Their initial model may have said 'buy' for GE, but they realize no other analysts have a buy rating on the stock. They're more likely to go back and revise their guesses to something more inline with their peers - its less risky to be with the crowd! TL;DR Security selection is hard and outperformance without MNP is unlikely over the long term. I am no longer in the industry. After 2.5yrs as an analyst and going through the CFA curriculum I've learned that there are VERY few opportunities for out performance, especially so on a risk adjusted basis.
