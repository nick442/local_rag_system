Combined spending during his administration grew by 3.5 trillion, not including the tax cuts (~1.5 trillion) and the afghanistan / iraq wars (~2 trillion combined). That adds up to more than half of the current national debt. I'm not sure how you think that wouldn't be making a huge difference right now. Sure, there was no 'real' surplus, but we were much less fucked.
