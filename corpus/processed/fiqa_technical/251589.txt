Problem with Boston is infrastructure. Not internet but general infrastructure. I don't know if the city itself is prime enough. Amazon would become a traffic and parking problem unto itself. That being said, the surrounding area is huge has open land and employees are probably happy to commute. Their greatest advantage is nexus distance from Seattle.
