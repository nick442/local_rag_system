Banks will be the ones running the service, just like JPMorgan runs the EBT system. http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/10/01/jp-morgan-s-food-stamp-empire.html Same with subprime mortgages - they say we need these programs to help the little people but it was really just to let banks issue moar debt knowing the gov would backstop them. And those people lost their fake home equity anyway. You have to wonder at what point people will realize [we don't need banks](/r/Bitcoin ) any more than we need snail-mail today. This proposal is the merger of two dead and incredibly wasteful industries, both propped up by .gov.
