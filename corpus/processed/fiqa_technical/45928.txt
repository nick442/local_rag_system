"We are fast food enemies. The thought of Arby's makes me laugh like a child on Hannukah. I may have a roast beef monstrosity today, as a matter of fact! Their curly fries are heavenly and a tub of their horsey sauce has been the champion on Iron Chef for 3 years running. Wendy's, on the other hand, is a disgrace to the burger world. Their square, ""never frozen"" patties taste fine, but the mealy texture is incredibly offputting. Their new fries are a marked improvement from the pale yellow, saltless worms they used to fix. Their menu is almost impossible to read and changes too often. They fucked up the frosty; I should never have to specify the flavor for the love of God. I have never been to a Tim Horton's, which I'm bummed about, because I've heard good things. How do you feel about McDonalds?"
