Is this an unusual amount to pay for refinancing a home loan? Yes, I would say it seems pretty high. Although credit unions usually have pretty good deals, I would shop around a bit. Is refinancing not worth it if you might move in the next year or two? Totally not worth it if you'll be moving in a year or two. You need to think realistically about what you could sell your house for though. If you bought it 4 years ago, it's likely gone down in value significantly (depending on your locale). Are you prepared to take a significant loss to sell? If not, you might be forced to stick it out for 3-5 years or more.
