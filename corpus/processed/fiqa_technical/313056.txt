The methodology leads me to believe the pollsters were setting up a poll for the sole purpose of getting a headline like this. For one, the pollsters eliminated anyone who didn't graduate with a 4-year degree, thus disqualifying anyone who has student loan debt but may have graduated with a lesser degree, or didn't graduate at all. I would assume (probably safely) that people with a 4-year degree are, on average, in a more financially stable situation than those who were disqualified from the poll, and this would be more likely to worry about other things rather than paying student loan debt. For two, the poll was commissioned by LendEDU, a refinancing startup that could use the publicity of student loan anxiety to drive more business. Having a clickbaity article like this on a relatively popular site like the Examiner that links straight to their website is just what a startup would love to have to get free marketing.
