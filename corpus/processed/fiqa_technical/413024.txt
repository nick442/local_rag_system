"We're discussing the ""why"" and ""how"" USA companies [ab]use H1B visas, when it is so clear and so obvious that companies do this purely to lower costs, even if there are US workers willing to do the work. The H1B visa is unequivically part of the race to the bottom. You defended it as, ""in an ideal economy.."" without presenting your idea that way to u/Yangoose and even told u/Yangoose they were wrong about how the economy works. You didn't present your ideas as part of a hypothetical government that had far less regulation or far less corruption than the USA has to u/Yangoose"
