Where do you get this BS? Show me a study that says taxing the 1% will damage the economy. They are already hoarding their wealth in foreign bank accounts. Also this professor is a Wall Street Financial Analyst, Distinguished Research Professor of Economics at the University of Missouri, Kansas City and author of Super-Imperialism: The Economic Strategy of American Empire..What do you know most knowledgeable economist don't know? Stop spewing right wing propaganda.
