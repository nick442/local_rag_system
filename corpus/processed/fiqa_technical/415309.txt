FBAR should be filed if total balance of all your foreign accounts is more than $10000 any time during the year (even if only for one day). My TurboTax handled that well last year, including filling the FBAR for me. Shouldn't be an issue, just don't forget to file it (not with your IRS package, it goes to a different place), if you need to. On the tax forms (1040 Schedule B, Part III) you should check a checkbox that you have a foreign bank account.
