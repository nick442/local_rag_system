Cars are not houses. The comparison is apples to oranges. Bad car loans actually can be good business for car dealers. When someone defaults on their car loan they very quickly lose the car. That car is then resold. Default on a home loan and you don't even have to leave the house, and there is no way for them to take the house back from you. It often takes a year or two for the bank and lawyers to get you kicked out of the house. A car however is on wheels, it can easily be moved and taken back. This article is some poorly researched 'sky is falling' click-bait.
