I think ihop does okay as when you think about it, there really aren't that many sit-down breakfast places that have the 'nationwide coverage' like ihop does. Sure, some places have Waffle House, Friendly's, Perkins, local Diners, etc., but they are fairly regional or scattered. Applebee's OTOH, is pretty much indistinguishable from the dozens and dozens of chain 'dinner-focused' restaurants out there.
