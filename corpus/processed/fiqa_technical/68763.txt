The problem with John Carter was the lack of a solid fanbase to appeal too. The series is old and the comic books are not that great to warrant any pop culture appeal. Now had they explained more about the storyline (and picked a different lead) in the marketing campaign they might have gotten more people interested. Probably the weakest Disney marketing I've ever seen.
