I've been eagerly waiting for new global business models in the TV business. I hate it when they cancel a show due to low amount of viewers in the States, while there are a few billion people outside the States ready to pay for the show. I'd happily pay that 1â‚¬ per episode and if even some percents of the rest of the world are willing to do the same, the creators of the series earn much more than with any ad based revenue model.
