>So this is the noble savage take I'm not up on white supremacist talking points so I have no idea what you're talking about. >Superior weapons? Ok, so what allowed them to develop this superior technology? Was it education, superior engineering, and tactics? Was it luck? Seriously Are these supposed to be gotcha questions? The weapons were borne out of necessity thanks to the comparatively harsh climate and lack of resources in Europe. Blacks are already born with the one thing needed to obliterate the white race. I find it funny that most of the ruins in Europe and former colonies are pointless forts. Even the legendary Colosseum is the literal circus part of bread and circuses to distract from the fact that there was always a war going on at the time.
