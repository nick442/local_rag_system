I apologize in advance if this seems heartless, Lord knows many on this site would consider me such, but it is my intention to be helpful. Rhetorically: Given your disability, could you find a different line of work that would have earn you a decent income? You mentioned fighting for disability for 5 years. Could that time have been spent creating a different occupation? Could you still do so? As you mention these are not large numbers prior to disability, but post-disability they are overwhelming. The tone of your post suggests that you feel trapped and helpless, and I really hate that for anyone. In some ways you are so close, just another $300/month puts you in the black! My encouragement would be to find a way to make this work. Find a way to earn more and you can keep your house and car.
