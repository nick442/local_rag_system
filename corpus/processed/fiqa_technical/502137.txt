The report I linked to appears to disagree with you about the numbers. But if you said that the number of contractors exceeding the number of government employees wasn't in and of itself hugely meaningful I'd not disagree. The point is that the military do outsource their work to various degrees, which was the point I'd been making, and so we're largely agreed. I wonder how it works out from a budgetary perspective for the professional mercenary companies, who I've read get paid massive amounts, which, I imagine, must irritate those doing similar work for government pay. People like Blackwater and their ilk.
