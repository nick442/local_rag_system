And I don't blame them for doing so. They get bonuses based on the bottom line and stock price, why not pump it as much as they can then when it starts to fall apart just go to another overpaid CEO position with another company start again, meanwhile someone else is more than willing to take the current overpaid CEO job and try to rescue/rebuild. Nowadays most CEO's didn't start the company they are at so they don't feel as attached as they should. Knowing this the only thing we can do make ourselves invaluable to the company so they have to give you more or go someplace that will.
