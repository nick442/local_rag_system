Listen Bernie Bro, if you think any centralized government will ever be fully accountable to we the people, you need to put down the hash pipe. Bernie wasn't even accountable to his own donors, that's why they're suing him ;) The only solution is for the government to stop inserting itself between people and Healthcare. Only then with direct pricing, lower barriers to entry, private charity and consumer choice can we lower costs. Cartels only exist because of state mandated regulation, patent law and government mandated Healthcare.
