amazon is only a handful of years old really. it didn't come into being until well into the time companies were alreadsy shipping customer service jobs overseas. they were lucky with when they entered the market. and keep in mind, amazon is a service, not a product. it was only after product uniformation started in the 90's that things other than the product became of interest to the consumer.
