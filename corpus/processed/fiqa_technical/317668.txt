Eh I look back now and realize the difference you are speaking of has to do with the state level rather than the federal level. I was think the federal budget still continues to grow. The issue is state budgets did shrink at least by about 200 billion. He's not really using a theory. He's using data on how government spending increased this current GDP forecast. It is written in the statistics of the second paragraph.
