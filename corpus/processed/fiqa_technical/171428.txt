I believe the insurance you are talking about is the type of insurance that makes your payment in the event you can't pay due to some specific reasons. These types of insurance are profit centers for the credit card companies and are generally not worth it for the consumer. You are better off picking the best credit card that meets your needs and then finding your insurance needs separately. Typically, the best credit card payment insurance plan is to not carry a balance and have a reasonable emergency fund. Putting the money that would have gone to insurance towards those two goals will likely help you more than paying for the credit card insurance policy.
