Actually, I don't know if you remember, but the security pre 9/11 was pretty good. They had a vested interest in doing their jobs as they were hired by the airport and had deliverables that weren't nationalized from a monolithic organization that is guaranteed funds no matter what. Having solid locking doors on the cockpit has now prevented future 9/11 attacks. Quite honestly, the odds of you being in a terrorist attack pre 9/11 were million s times less than getting into a car accident. So, no, I don't think 9/11 should be used opportunistically to drastically push an agenda via security theater that has no purpose other than to test the tolerance of the population for rights reduction.
