There is light at the end of the tunnel, but it is at least a decade off, possibly more - and it is going to get far worse before it gets better. We've got an economic collapse and a depression coming still. The government has done about as much economic manipulation as it can reasonably do, and those things can't be avoided anymore. The only thing the government can do is control the timing to a limited extent (though the more they try to put it off, the worse it will be). Obama can't fix this - neither can Congress anymore. The time when it was possible to avoid the disaster is past. We've been doing this to ourselves for more than 50 years and it will soon be time to pay the piper. All we can do is prepare for it as best we can and try to ride it out.
