I think with your background you would be well suited to Equity Research in Oil, Biotech, or Pharma. Not an area I know well but people who have greater understanding of the company's business are valuable in that field when combined with finance knowledge. By your questions I would definitely advise some more investigation into finance and your motivations for getting into it. What do you want out of finance? How does the field match up with your life goals and your personal values? Read some primers on Wall Street Oasis and some of Mergers and Inquisitions if you haven't already. Sorry for the unwanted advice rant. Just see lots of people attracted to money, prestige, or perceived glamour of finance without thinking about whether it's really what they want.
