That was a major statistic (that I can't find [Honestly I didn't look but I know it is out there]) that supporters of obama care would use. Basically they said a large portion of those that are uninsured are healthy people between the ages of 18-35, who don't see the need for health insurance, can't afford health insurance, or feel like they are never going to die or get sick so whats the point?. So the argument was: If the pool for people paying for health insurance increases, with a majority of that increase being people who will not use the system very much, then rates should drop for everyone since there are more healthy people covering for the unhealthy people. I didn't assume, that was how it was marketed while it was being proposed.
