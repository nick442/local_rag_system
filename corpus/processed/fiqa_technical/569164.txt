There are only so many ways a penis can go into a vagina, and pretty much all of them on are on the internet for free now. The internet did have a lot to do with the downfall of porn, it's not nearly close to anything about struggling to find content people will pay for. The problem they have is creating loyalty, which used to be relatively easy, but now is almost impossible because their content is freely available on a wide variety of sites (that you no longer have 18 million pop-up ads on or have to click through 20 loops). Without any loyalty whatsoever, they're losing the ability to make money, and their field is also getting populated with more employees than there is demand for (wages cut by up to 80%). The prostitution industry itself is likely doing fine.
