I meant the form factor - it's a tablet form factor. It's not something new, or refreshing.. something that Nintendo used to be great with - the anticipation built for it's next design, for both consoles and handheld consoles. It has a custom SoC from a known architecture from NVIDIA, and where it should have been amazing - it comes short imo (battery life). Probably in one year period it's performance will be matched with high end tablets with off the shelf SoCs.. ARM SoCs that support Vulkan for example, over NVIDIA closed source libraries. The thing is performance isn't everything - and Nintendo it's the proof of such concept. Currently it's all about the IP.
