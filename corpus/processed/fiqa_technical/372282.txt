"> I was saying a lot of people dont understand that. They see they spent X at Chilis (processing) and assume it to be fact. I don't understand why you're having such a difficult time with this concept. And the solution -- keeping an ACCURATE and independent checkbook register (rather than relying on an ""online balance"") is still the same. >Also comparing swiping a debit card as credit to writing a check (in terms of when they show up on your account) is a terrible comparison. Nope. It's the same thing. You're still talking about a discrepancy between what has been processed, versus what you have ACTUALLY spent. >And calling me ignorant because I don't need the help writing down where my money is at or goes is pretty ironic. Well, if you're having problems with overdrafts (as you claimed you had) then rather obviously you DO need help (or at least you need to own up to where the problem lies -- your faulty ""memory"" of what you spent)."
