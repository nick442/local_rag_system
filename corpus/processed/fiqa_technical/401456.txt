Which is why outside of Germany, you have abysmal unemployment rates. 23.6% in Greece. 19.6% in Spain. 11.7% in Italy. 10% in France. 11.2% in Portugal. The US unemployment rate during the Great Recession peaked at 10%. You can have labor that is controlled like you mention and high unemployment or lower controls and less unemployment. Is it better to have high unemployment but workers that are better off or lower unemployment and workers that aren't as well off? The Euro zone is forgetting how to be competitive. We live in an economy where price matters. The price of labor determines the prices of goods and services. And supply and demand of products and services are determined by prices. Its a cold hard truth.
