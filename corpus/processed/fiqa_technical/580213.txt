"It would appear that you are not actually ""equal"" partners. You have differently valued interests and those values fluctuate based on individual performance. The TurboTax advice is simplified for entities that don't track interests relative to partner inputs. IRC ยง 704(a), partner's distributive share is set by the partnership agreement, and ยง 704(b), failing an allocation by the agreement it is set by the partner's interest in the partnership. But note ยง 704(b)(2), which prevents blatant tax-rigging in the partnership agreement."
