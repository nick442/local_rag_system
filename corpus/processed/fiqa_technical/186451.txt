There is a lot of depth that can go into this. Depends on how far you want to take this. Think u have the right idea.. people who go the extra step get promoted. If prior reporting was very simple, u can build on it over time. I suggest starting with some Known Performance Indicators / KPIs since mgmt can understand those easier than detailed analysis. You can start with identifying metrics that matter. Probably total assets, avg account bal, average customer bal, avg # of accounts per customer, new deposits/withdrawal both gross and avg per account/customer, new/closed accounts. Once metrics are picked gather monthly (or whatever time period) and monitor/review month over month/year over year. PM if u want to discuss more. I have experience in data analytics.
