I dig the entire stable of Motley Fool podcasts. Motley Fool Money and Market Foolery are pretty fun and Industry Focus can offer some interesting insight. I also enjoy the marketplace podcast with Kai Ryssdal. However some of the human interest pieces can stray farther from finance than I would like.
