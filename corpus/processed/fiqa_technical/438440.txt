I think where TiVo went wrong is not securing contracts with as many cable/satellite service companies as they could. It was an amazing product that has truly revolutionized television. They had to know service providers would be right on their heels with similar products and would be a cheap rental as opposed to hundreds of dollars of upfront cost. Now every service provider has their own DVR, and none have that TiVo logo on it.
