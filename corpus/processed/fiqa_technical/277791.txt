"While that's possible, there is no guarantee. The ultimate thing causing the ""scare"" was a loss of jobs due to outsourcing. I know we associate it with the housing bubble. But really we moved to housing from dot-com, and we moved to dot-com from real manufacturing and production. These more recent bubbles were ways of ""making up"" for the lost of manufacturing jobs. Manufacturing jobs left (I'm going to focus on the US) the US because it was cheaper in other countries. Now, once debt is largely payed off, people will likely be willing to accept lower pay, making production in the US cheaper. However, we still have environmental regulations and basic labor laws. Further, initial education to enter the job market brings about massive debt as well. This is pure speculation, but what I think will happen is collapse of the ""education bubble"". People will lose faith in college degrees and start working as contractors, plumbers, mechanics, etc. This will generate a direct wealth, but it will also severely hurt our ability to innovate due to the resulting ""brain drain"". Multiple educational facilities will close down or contract, and some private schools will convert to public to stay afloat. Many jobs will also be lost. The resulting outflow of academicians will stimulate the development of new start-ups in online education and smaller institutes. This will lead to cheaper education with more ""certifications"" over ""degrees"". This will also lead to more start-ups in direct production of goods. I'm thinking this process will take another 5-7 years or so. Again, this is just wild-ass guessing on my side based on observed trends."
