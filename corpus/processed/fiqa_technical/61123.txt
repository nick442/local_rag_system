This is nonsense and just a game to squeeze more money from consumers. A convential car needs to change oil every so often. You get a warning light in the dashboard for that in most cars. If you decide to not change oil as needed, it's your business and your problem that you shortened your car's life. Do you want conventional cars to stop working when oil change is due? Basically Tesla is crippeling the car and does not let the consumer to FULLY use the car they own, if they choose to do that.
