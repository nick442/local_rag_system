Interest per month is 12th root of annual interest, or a multiplier of about 1.0327%. At end of 1st month, you start with $0, add interest on $0, and add $600, getting $600. 2nd month: start with $600, add 0.0327% interest plus $600, getting $1219.62. 3rd: balance plus interest plus deposit yields $1859.50 Repeat ad nauseam. Easier with a spreadsheet or a bit of trivial programming. Or you can try to re-derive the formulas, but that is left as an exercise for the student.
