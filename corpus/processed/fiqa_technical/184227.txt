there's only so much calculations a person can do before they're fatigued people calculate how much time to give themselves to get ready for the day before work, they calculate necessary things during work, they calculate the gasoline or train ticket prices on their way home from work, they calculate how far they can stretch their budget after their rent increase, and then when they go shopping they have to calculate which toilet paper out of 20 choices is the most economical and not being sand paper people are not lazy.. it's the system that makes people fatigued. We have *too* many choices. *Too* many calculations.
