"Can you elaborate? What other countries are you talking about? It's definitely not uncommon for publicly funded ""healthcare"" (unsure why you put this in quotations) to go to corporate revenues / profits. Canada and Switzerland are two examples off the top of my head who use similar systems. Many other countries use a private sector component. ""The margins are huge"" largely because of government involvement. The bloated Resource-Based Relative Value Scale (RBRVS) standardized payment scheme determines payments for services based on the resource costs estimated by a committee that meets in private (the Relative Value Update Committee). This impractical archaic value system has been adopted by 80% of private insurers, impairing their ability to drive down and offer more competitive prices."
