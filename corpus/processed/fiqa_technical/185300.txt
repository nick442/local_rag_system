It's difficult to tell. It was estimated that when putting on QE .. it brought yields on those instruments down by approximately 50bp. When unwinding in a period of moderate growth one might expect that to (partially) reverse. It will depend on the rate of the unwinding as well as economic growth (the more growth .. the less effect the unwinding will have; if the unwinding outpaces growth, the stronger it will push the curve).
