"Marketing is much more than ad placement. It encompasses everything - product price, design, how it feels in your hand, how it tastes, where you buy it, what you think when you think of a product in your mind. Imagine something when you read the word ""soda"" - what comes to mind? Does it have a design? Color? A name? A label? Can you imagine the taste? Unless you live in a self sufficient commune, you are influenced by marketing to some degree."
