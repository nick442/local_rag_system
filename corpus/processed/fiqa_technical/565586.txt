When I was flying BA rather than Virgin Atlantic I occasionally ended up suffering on an American Airlines flight (stupid BA allied with them for whatever reason). Those flights were one of the biggest reasons I jumped to Virgin Atlantic. BA is great, but subjecting me to those AA planes was just too much after I had been in coach on a window seat and had my shoulder hit the side *in normal seated position* (I'm 187cm), something I've **never** had happen to me before. Absolutely wonderful on an Atlantic crosser let me tell you. I also had to spend time in their miserable lounge at Logan once. Even that was a weak experience. Anyway, any and all bad news to them are just what they deserve.
