"Honestly, reddit should just become a non-profit. It's impossible to monetize it to the point of profitability without killing it. Instead of having [dozens of](http://web.archive.org/web/20160109193605/https://www.reddit.com/about/team) largely unnecessary roles like ""video producer"", ""writer"", and ""Ad Operations Lead"", ""Sales Operations Lead"", and various management roles, go back to the old days of having a small but hyper-focused group of software developers and IT guys running the site. That's how it was when reddit was great. It might even be greater because there won't be outside pressure from advertisers and shareholders trying ruin the community and software."
