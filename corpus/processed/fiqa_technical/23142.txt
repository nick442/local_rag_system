"What he said was: >Short term returns show ""fat tails"" in their distribution. This means that in the short run, rare events in the stock market, like huge up and downswings, happen much more often than you would expect given the circumstances. >Long term returns converge towards a gaussian distribution. This means that long term changes in stock prices show about the level of swings you would expect to see. >The authors think there's a connection between this and the ""long memory"" of >volatility (i.e. that the autocorrelation of absolute volatilities also has a fat tail). Auto-correlation is the idea that an event is closely related, or depends upon, a previous event. It shouldn't be a surprise that prices can depend on previous prices. (Contrast this with a coin toss. Each time you toss the coin, the result is independent of any previous result.) Normally, you would use an estimate of auto-correlation to test the randomness of your time series. Unless you have good reason to do otherwise, you use the standard normal (or Gaussian) distribution to do so. Some previous study, or perhaps this one, may have found that the distribution of their auto-correlation estimates for volatility (change in prices) is not normally distributed, but rather that extreme values happen more often than would be expected (fat tail). These guys find a correlation between the short term return fat tails, the normally distributed long term returns, and a previous finding that the auto-correlation of volatility may have fat tails, and they think that these things could be more than simply coincidence."
