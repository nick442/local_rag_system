"It's almost as if you're *completely* wrong. Tell me what Citibank has anything to do with JP Morgan. Tell me again how JP Morgan is responsible for CDO's and MBS's. Tell me again how JP Morgan cost the tax payers money. Tell me again how investment banks made investments based on the premise of ""taxpayers will cover it"" Tell me again how JP Morgan gambled and needed to be bailed out. Tell me how the TARP cost taxpayers even a cent. Amazing how someone can have such strong feelings about something they have 0 knowledge of. Educate yourself moron."
