"There are cases where it makes sense to insure something, even if you can bear its loss. Insurance is a tool to control risk. One reason you might want to control risk is indeed if you cannot afford to bear it's loss. However, there are other reasons you might wish to insure something when you look at your life in totality. Let's say you have $100 to work with, and you have an item A that costs $30. Perhaps you really need A in your life, but its clear here that you can afford to replace it, so maybe you don't insure it. Then you get item B, which also costs $30, and item C which costs $30. We can see that you can cover all three of these (total value $90), so one might argue that you don't need to insure it. Now let's add item D onto the plate, also at a cost of $30. Now you're in an interesting position, with 4 items you depend on, A B C and D, which have a sum total replacement cost of $120. Now if all of these break or are stolen, you no longer have the funds to replace them. Of course, what are the odds that all of them break at the same time? You may be able to do the math to determine the probability of going broke, and use that to determine whether you want to insure the item or not. Now consider that you will have to make a similar mathematical analysis for every additional purchase you make. You will also have items which you can ""bear to lose"" but you really don't want to. These can add a large amount of effort to every decision you make. It may be worth getting insurance in such a case. One could think of the purchase in two parts. There is the part that accounts for the statistical expectation of loss, and the other is the insurance company's profits. The profits could be thought of as paying the insurance company for a service which makes it easier for you to think through complicated decisions by removing risk."
