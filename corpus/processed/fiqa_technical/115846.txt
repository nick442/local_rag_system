"Work hard, be loyal, save your pennies and in the end? You get screwed. Employees not getting what they were promised is only part of the problem. The more important issue is the death of the average worker's faith in the Capitalist system. The ""American Dream"" is now a cruel joke. The bankers and right-wing wealthy are destroying America with their greed. And to anyone who would argue that it's the union that's to blame for being greedy, all I can do is point to the Pentagon budget and ask, ""Why is there plenty of money for useless war while Americans lose their homes? Criminals with degrees in economics and foolish politicians are stealing from us all. My hope is that ""we the people"" drive them all to Hell some day soon."
