"And you think they do this out of the goodness of their hearts, or because it maximizes their appeal to a niche audience with lots of disposable income and higher proportional spending on luxury food and drink items? Do you honestly believe that anything in a Whole Foods isn't proven to be helpful in selling products? Look at how fervently you jumped forth to inform me of how polluted that other meat is- do you ever wonder if maybe that passion is appealed to and marketer towards by businesses, and as such, there exists a profit incentive to make ""organic, pure"" foods as attractive as possible to consumers? To claim Whole Foods is somehow less consumerist than any other retail chain is absurd. It is the most modern contrivance possible- a result of years of manipulation of public opinion through advertising about the *quality* of your food, based around fearmongering about unknown chemicals and ethical questions about livestock care."
