Hybrids & electrics are not quite ready for the prime time. The cost of manufacturing the batteries, let alone problems of efficiency, and eventually replacement, means that, without a massive and permanent increase in oil prices, widespread adoption is unlikely. I forget what the gasoline cost per gallon often cited is, for electric and hybrid vehicles to become competitive.. I think it was typically north of $8/gallon. Of course, twenty to thirty years out, we quite well may have such. However, the cost of those vehicles won't be coming down without some near technological miracle, in both battery design and production - those who can afford $40,000 for a car will retain the autonomy granted by private transportation. Everyone else will probably clamor for meaningful public transportation options - and /or move to a more dense settlement pattern that does not mandate individual vehicle ownership
