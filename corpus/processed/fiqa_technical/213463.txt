I use the taxi app in the tri-citys it's way quicker then calling dispatch. It's as close to getting uber, in bc as far as I can tell. Gives you the dollar amount when booked and tells you can drivers name you're going to get then you can leave reviews on the cab driver as well. General wait time on busy nights is under 20mins. Try going through dispatch and its hours and many phone calls to get a cab. I'd call this a huge improvement.
