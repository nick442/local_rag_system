"One must point out: The Fed has never in their history, correctly ""expected"" any financial crises. They have been surprised 100% of the time. They weren't even aware of the biggest financial collapse in US history in 2007-8 before it happened -- when rhe blogosphere and so-called ""fringe economists"" were warning about it daily. The fact that Yellen doesn't ""expect it"" should be assumed at this point. As should its inevitability."
