Go with a TFSA before RRSP unless your wages put you in the top two tax brackets. The promise that your tax rates will be lower in retirement is just a sales pitch. You can see how this plays out with your own assumptions using the spreadsheet at http://www.retailinvestor.org/SaveInRRSPorTFSA.xls There are long list of differences between the accounts (see http://www.retailinvestor.org/rrsp.html#tfsa) but most all come down on the side of the TFSA unless you are a high roller.
