"Yeah, I'm actually working on such a web server.. And you're right, it's really an entire platform more than it is a web server (though you can certainly use it as ""just a web server""). Also, I did loads of testing to see what it takes to prevent adblock from working properly. Avoid the obvious stuff like using standard banner sizes and serving images from a directory called ""ads"" (hehe). I don't want to give away my secrets just yet but if you too make it your goal to work around adblock you'll find nearly impenetrable solutions in no time :)"
