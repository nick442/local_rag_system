I get it! It was not Obama fault - it was Bush. And it's not Trump achievement - it is Obama. What's next? As you know, in 8 years Obama never achieved GDP over 3%. Last quarter, the GDP was over 3%. Is that because of Obama, or, maybe, just maybe, because of Trump? And the stock market breaking records: probably because of lack of faith in Trump.
