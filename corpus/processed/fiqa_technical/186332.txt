Exactly. And I'm diversified in other ways. I have a money collection that includes lots of silver and some gold, a rental property. In terms of actual cash accounts it's closer to 750K. Protip: I always keep actual cash dollars in a safe in the house as well. I learned that trick from my neighbor who said she needed it twice in her life. Even a safe deposit box isn't good enough as the government can get in there, too. She and her husband owned a gas station and unbeknownst to them the Sunoco gas trucks were leaking when filling their tanks so they had a big ecological problem. The government took every bit of liquid assets they had.. that they could find. Then when he died a few years ago something similar thing happened and she needed to dip into it.
