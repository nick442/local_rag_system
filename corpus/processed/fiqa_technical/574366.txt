"Full disclosure: I own restaurants. It's a bit of a Catch-22. It's a weird time for the restaurant industry because minimum wage is going up (which I'm all for) but in a lot of states, you don't get tip credits. So, ""Make at least good food with decent portion sizes at a moderate price"" is pretty tough to hit. ""Good"" food costs more yet bargain chains like BWW get raked across the coals for being too expensive. It's why fast-casual (Chipotle, et al) are taking business from Applebee's and BWW. I think we're going to see a lot of the casual dine-in restaurants fall by the wayside pretty soon, their rent and labor costs just aren't sustainable in a bargain-seeking market. Good, fast, cheap. Pick two."
