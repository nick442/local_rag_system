This comes as a consequence to the notion of an income tax. Remove that, and there won't be shenanigans like this anymore. Libertarians don't stand for the notion that government owns your property (income) and can determine how much you get to keep after they forcefully take some from you or threaten you with being put in a cage. Rather, we suggest for a consumption tax to replace it.
