No, there is not a finite amount of work to be done, people have unlimited wants. Say we do fully automate all physical work, everyone could simply expand our human understanding, create art, play spectator sports, jobs that I can't even think of because there are not very important to us now but when more important concerns are met, these less important concerns, like art, become the most important. Such as when you want food and water you don't care much for shelter, when you need shelter you don't care much about healthcare, when you need healthcare you don't worry about self actualization ect. This reminds me of a story that france wanted to double the amount of jobs available so they made it illegal to work more then 20 hours a week. It failed because unemployment is not a result from insufficient work to be done. Not sure if true though.
