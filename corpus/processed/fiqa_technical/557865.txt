No financial interest means that you have signing authority over the account, but you don't own the money in it and aren't allowed to withdraw from it at will. One example would be a business account owned by a company where you're employed as a purchasing manager, and you need to sign checks drawn on that account to pay invoices. FBAR doesn't care about income -- it just wants to know about every account that you having signing authority over.
