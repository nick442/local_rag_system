Sorry, missed this reply in with all the others. Apparently I touched some nerves, and I saw the comment got linked to a Libertarian sub. Your argument assumes that there is no choice. Isn't a bedrock of Libertarian policy self sufficiency? Slaves were called slaves because they were absolutely controlled through force, and the threat of death or severe physical torture. If you are trying to equate that to taxes and the penalties for not paying them, then that truly is an argument from the extreme. I used an example of being a grown capable adult, and living in a drug dealers house. You have the ability to leave at any time if you wanted, but there would be a cost of course - moving isn't free, and you might have to answer to the drug dealer if he had expectations of you. However, if you truly dissagreed with how he was living and making his money, wouldn't you try to change his ways? And if you couldn't, wouldn't you leave - otherwise aren't you implicitly endorsing his way of life?
