">HOWEVER, any close to normal person can see that there are a whole lot of people with serious issues that nobody mentions to them (or they themselves are afraid to acknowledge) because they don't want to deal with all of the drama. Doesn't mean they are caused by a ""mental illness"". >And, just to be clear, the term ""Mental Illness"" in this case(according to the above studies) is really anything from anxiety, to depression, to schizophrenia, personality disorders, and even more social things like compulsive lying. Obviously, the definition is very broad and that is precisely why the statistic(25%) is so shocking. Just to be clear.. that is basically the definition of a ""con operation"". The term ""mental illness"" (as it is used by the industry) is simply a fraud."
