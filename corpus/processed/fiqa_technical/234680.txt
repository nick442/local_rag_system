Copyrights and patents are inventions of the state meant to encourage producers to create works that benefit society *not* ensure the benefits of proceeding generations and their scions. You can't own an and occupy an idea like you can land or gold and to create a system that rewards the production of ideas takes resources to support and thus can such guarantees be sustained for a finite amount of time and not in perpetuity.
