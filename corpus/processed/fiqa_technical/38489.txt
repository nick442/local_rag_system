"An opinion piece, written to read like a factual article. My opinion is, a bigger phone would, to me, be far better. I have no problem fitting a Galaxy Note 3 into my pocket, and, while I had to learn a modified grip style, had no trouble reaching every corner of that whole screen with my thumb. I remember, back in 1991, my company was delivering and installing brand new computers into an office, and there was this older lady standing in the way of the dolly waving a 2.5"" floppy disk (from those old typewriters with a single LCD panel) screaming, ""What is wrong with you people! This is all we need! This is stupid!"" Etc. After about an hour of taking this, and weaving around her increasingly shrill presence, one of her coworkers pulled her away, saying, ""Margaret, get out of the way of progress."""
