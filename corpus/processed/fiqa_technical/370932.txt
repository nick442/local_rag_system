Thank you for clarifying your meaning. Though I'd counter that if your goal is to manipulate economic exchanges between individuals with the intention of guiding the economy at large to a specific desired outcome, I think that capitalism is not the economic system for you :P I just think it's not so cool to treat Bob's artificially-caused job loss as an acceptable casualty on the grounds that overall *hopefully* everyone (including Bob) will be better *eventually.* I think Bob might object pretty strenuously, in fact, and that Bob should get a say. Presumably there will be enough people who are willing to sacrifice their current jobs - and undergo the short term hardship - in pursuit of a better future that the mandated wage increase can proceed as desired.
