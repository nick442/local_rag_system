If you stopped blaming everyone else perhaps you'd be less angry and sharp-tongued. The world is not full of morons fucking everything up. What it is full of is people who make mistakes and the uninformed. If you can bypass your narcissism, you'll see the root of the problem - why these things occur. Then you can fix them instead of complaining about them.
