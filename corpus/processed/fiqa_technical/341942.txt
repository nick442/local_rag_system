I think one concern is that this could widen the gap beyond what a social net can compensate for. Yes, there are geniuses and idiots now, but the geniuses can't go too far because there are not enough of them to band together. Not so when it is just a large cheque away. But as discussed in other branches of this thread, maybe I am making a mountain out of a molehill. Improvements of this degree may happen gradually over the course of a couple of decades, and I hope we figure out a fair but progressive way to deal with it.
