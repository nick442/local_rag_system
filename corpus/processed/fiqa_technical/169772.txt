Hi, I'm trying to obtain daily time series for CZK Swap zero curve through Bloomberg Terminal for my thesis, dating at least 120 days back. I have basically zero experience working with the Terminal, and so far I have managed only to get data for one day (using BCurve and BCurvestrip functions in excel). I have also tried to message the support team, however their answer led me just to the functions I have already used. Here is a screenshot of what I want to get for each [day](https://i.stack.imgur.com/1yzQM.jpg), from 1st of July until today.
