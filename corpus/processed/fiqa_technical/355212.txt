You can reprocess the spent fuel to extract unburned uranium fuel, as is done elsewhere in the world. Thorium based fuel produces less long lives actinide waste (high level nastiness) and in my opinion would be a key step toward making nuclear a viable option. Nuclear is very politically volatile so a decade long planning effort can be subjected to winds of change with respect to politics, licensing, funding, and public opinions which can make for enormous inefficiencies. Solar has public favor so there are plenty of incentives. Nuclear would have to receive a push like that. Done properly a nuclear power plant should not contaminate the land it sits on. Currently plants have extensive environmental monitoring required by regulation. Nuclear power plants don't have extensive storage ponds for spent fuel. Every plant has a storage pool to wait for decay heat to subside as part of the refueling cycle. An issue with nuclear is that mistakes don't just biodegrade on a human timescale as they do for chemical based mistakes. The nuclear industry is currently paying for the sins of its birth and formative years.
