Depends on what you are going for. Sometimes first to market is the correct decision, while other times being more conservative is correct. All depends on risk/reward. Edit: given that this was merely supposed to be a proof of concept/advertisement for the business's speed capabilities, and the low cost involved, there didn't appear to be very much risk.
