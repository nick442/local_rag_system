I disagree. First off the SEC is under-funded anyhow, and most economists agree that there needs to be better regulation of the exchanges; ya know since it can fucking crash our economy and send us into WW3. Secondly, it's a flat Transaction tax much like any other State Sales Tax. State Sales Tax is arguably the most successful form of taxation there is, b/c it's so damn easy to implement, and so damn easy to audit. You're blowing this thing way out of proportion. They require the markets to charge a Transaction tax, and then they do periodic audits to ensure each exchange is doing it. The rates go up or down based on the previous quarters number of HFTs. Outside of said formula, this transaction rate can be altered by a meeting of a few SEC heads, and approved when approved by the appropriate congressional body. Kills 2 birds with one stone: * more money to the underfunded SEC * lessens the impact of HFTs and turns the markets back into a market instead of a casino. It will have minimal effects on buy & hold traders since they typically research for a long time, then buy & hold stock for many months. It will mainly affect those who buy & unload several times per day. PS: If you think that letting a market die and having new ones pop up periodically is a good idea then holy shit. Financial markets need stability & regulation. Finance doesn't like uncertainty. Crash & burn marketplaces will help no one, and will raise uncertainty which we all know investors hate.
