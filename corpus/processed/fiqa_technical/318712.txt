"Full employment is a joke. Look at the [labor force participation rate](https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS11300000) most gains in income are being seen with the top ~1%. Most people who have ""recovered"" are referring to the stock market. Which has seen tremendous growth. But IMO this is due to a lack of places to put money. Sure some people lost their jobs and now have one but I wouldn't say that on average we are any better off than pre 08."
