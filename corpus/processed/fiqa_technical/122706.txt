"Don't get all high headed now. The filth you've been spewing today shows that you don't do you own ""cross checking/thinking"". But the fact that you think you do really is telling. Again, you and your buddies at /r/the_Donald are the armpit of humanity. Again, never said anything about liking Bernie. Again, you are projecting. And finally, again, your view of the world is just straight up based on fabrication. Learn something about other people, so that you actually can talk about things that you understand, or shut your fucking idiot mouth. You are not helping matters with your ignorance. You're entitled to your opinion, but when your opinion is that you can say any old stupid thing that pops into your head, you really need to learn to shut the hell up. You're wrong about everything you've said. One day you may realize that. Probably not, but there's always hope."
