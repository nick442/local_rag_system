"The problem is the use of short-hand. Their chopped off sentence. When someone says: ""there is a labor shortage"" what they really mean is: ""There is a labor shortage at the current wage."" A related problem happens when a company finds out, for example, that it would have to give it's 18 currently employed welders all a $10/hr raise just to attract 2 new ones at the new higher wage. Another problem is there use to be trade unions that organized and maintained a talent pool that could dynamically meet demand for skilled labor. These trade unions have largely been done away with. They were the one's attracting, recruiting, and selecting skilled tradespeople just like colleges do."
