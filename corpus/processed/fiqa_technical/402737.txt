It's one of those things like the Economist that most people in business feel you should probably at least skim, but no one really does because who has time for that? If I really wanted to get at least one subscription though, it would be to the Economist. It's a lot more practical than HBR, and unless you're in a position to really affect change in your organization, HBR is going to be little more than thought exercises. And even if you can't get through the massive amount of information each week, reading just the politics/business this week sections, the leaders, maybe the briefing and the sections of the world you're interested in can be done in one sitting and would be enough to keep you more or less on top of the really important global issues.
