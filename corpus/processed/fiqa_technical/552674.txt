Yes, this will reduce your total interest. But not by much. Scenario 1: You run up bills for the month totaling $750, and then at the end of the month you get paid and pay $750. Scenario 2: You pay $750 at the beginning of the month. Then over the course of the month you run up bills totaling $750. Assume you have carryover debt of over $750 so you don't have a credit balance at any point. Either way, the net change in your balance for the month is zero. Assuming you spent about the same amount of money each day, the difference in your average daily balance will be $750. If you're paying 18% -- I think that's a fairly typical credit card rate -- that's 1 1/2% per month, so the difference in interest will be about $10. Note this is the most extreme case, the difference between paying on the first day of the billing period and paying on the last day of the billing period, and assuming that you pay all your bills by credit card. So in real life the difference in the interest will probably be less. You're talking about a technique to save maybe five bucks a month. I suppose every dollar helps. But the real solution is to get your credit cards paid off so you're not paying ANY interest.
