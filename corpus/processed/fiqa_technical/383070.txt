Good sales people are difficult to find, so most companies offer them a decent salary and bonus to keep them incentivized. At the end of the day, sales is what keeps a business afloat. I'm not saying the other job positions aren't important. Afterall, you need a product to sell or you won't be in business long. But great sales people are always in high demand. The more they sell, the richer the company gets. The sales people are the ones generating revenue and profit for the company, so it makes sense if you look at it from that perspective. Although I agree with you--everyone in the company should receive some sort of bonus for exceptional performance.
