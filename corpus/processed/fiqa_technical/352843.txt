What about the jobs!?! You know how many people work in health care! Repealing health care is like shooting our economy in both feet and then having no health care workers. I could toss a few FUs out to these CEOs, insurance companies for holding us hostage. But my comment is really think about the ground workers, the people who actually do the work, their jobs will be eliminated first when the patients stop coming.
