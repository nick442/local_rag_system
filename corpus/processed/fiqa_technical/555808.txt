neat thanks for the answer, so you are saying that we will adapt and get now jobs that are not yet in existence, you mention the service related jobs but lets say that even that field becomes obsolete will we get to a point of no jobsand riot?(well this is maybe going too far in the future so its all speculation) And the trend that the richer get richer and the poorer get pooere has to stop too, so maybe violent stop?
