">I was rooting for the cancer. If you can't figure out by 30 that basic decency not only is intrinsically good, but is also in your own self interest you don't deserve the basic respect of others. Your post is so hilariously ironic. Are you under 30? Because you obviously must have not figured out that basic decency is intrinsically good, or else you wouldn't be 'rooting for the cancer.' So much for being a non-shitty human. >Shitty humans do more damage to the planet on a day to day basis than any ""genius"" does good. Where does this claim even come from? >This stupid prick took an existing technology, dumbed it down to attract the stupid, and prettied it up to attract the narcissistic. Jobs was an asshole, but he was also an amazing individual in a lot of other respectable ways. I used to dislike him because he came off extremely arrogant in interviews, but after watching several documentaries, I came to respect him a lot. It's so easy to sit back in your arm chair and call him a stupid prick who ""only"" took existing technology and prettied it up to attract the narcissist idiots, but at the end of the day, Apple would not be what it is today without Jobs' relentless drive for success. Whatever he did, he was very good at it. To write him off as if he just got lucky by putting 2+2 together is just idiotic."
