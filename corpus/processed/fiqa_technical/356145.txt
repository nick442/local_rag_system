It depends on where you live and what your situation is. If you're a born and bred New Yorker who thinks that White Plains, NY is a stop on the way to Canada, than you're ok. If you're a single person living in downtown Boston, you may want to err on the side of spending less. You may find yourself in a situation in a few short years where you significant other has a job in the suburbs and the prospect of sending your child to a city school is not appealing.
