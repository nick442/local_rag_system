money can make people do some odd things, it makes otherwise nice people stab other nice friendly people in the back for a decent paycheck. now i'm fresh out of school with the intent of finding a job that is going to make me want to get up in the morning with a smile across my face, it could be minimum wage and it would not bother me in the slightest as much as the media and the government would like you to think, it really does not cost that much to live a simple life and be happy about it, consumerism has really fucked people up and it is a shame, i'm in it for the memories and fun times not spending countless hours breaking my back for a company that would fuck me over in an instant.
