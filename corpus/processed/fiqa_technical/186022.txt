"Anyone who suggests unions are anti-capitalist has their head completely up their ass. And this whole ""ban collective bargaining"" thing which people have been trying to do in certain places confuses the hell out of me. Collective bargaining isn't even a right, it's a natural consequence of having more than 2 people in any given system. It's inherent. It might as well be a physical law. It's impossible to ban. And it's the very epitome of what a free market system stands for. If the free market allows corporations to form, i.e. people coming together for mutual benefit in industry, then they certainly allow labor unions to form, i.e. people coming together for mutual benefit in industry. **They're the same fucking thing, people**."
