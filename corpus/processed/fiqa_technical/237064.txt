That sounds like you work for a shitty company. Regardless of who is at fault in an incident, you fire the person? I bet your employees have low morale, knowing that somone else's mistake can cost them their job. The idea behind self driving vehicles is that you dont have accidents. No accidents, means lesser exposure and liability risk for the operating compnay. Are computers fail safe? Of course not, but human driven vehicles have a far worse driving record, currently.
