I think it varies with where you are located but in Ontario, Canada salaries cover up to 44 work hours a week. Anything beyond the 44 hours counts towards overtime. Eg. You normally make $1000 a week and this week you worked 50 hours. $1000/44 = $22.73/hr Overtime rate is 1.5x normal so.. $22.73 x 1.5 = $34.10/hr You work 6 extra hours $34.10 x 6 = $204.60 Added together $1000 + $204.60 = $1204.60
