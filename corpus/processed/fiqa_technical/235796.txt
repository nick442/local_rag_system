I needed to get my building's dryer vent cleaned, and decided to go with Sears Air Duct cleaning because I wanted to deal with a reputable company instead of using one of these fly-by-night companies with the $50 coupon deals you get in the mail. I cost $400 to get the dryer and HVAC vents cleaned, and the guy ruined almost every corner in my apartment, which required me to repaint me entire place at a cost of hundreds of dollars in paint. When the hose wrapped around the corners the abrasion took off the paint and left scuff marks everywhere. I pointed it out to him *as* it was happeneing, and Tony from Staten Island's response was that there was nothing he could do about it. And when he tried to clean out the dryer vent he broke off the louver from the outside vent, so now bugs or birds can fly inside it. **tl;dr** Never deal with Sears for HVAC/dyer vent cleaning. Your place will be dirter than if you just left it alone.
