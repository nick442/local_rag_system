"Monopolies don't always charge more than a competitive market, this is true, but it's still anti-competitive to have a monopoly, regardless if the consumer ""benefits"" from a lower price. I think it's important to breed competition, even in the rare cases where consumers might benefit from a lower price (In the long run, innovation would be stifled and consumers could be worse off). I just wanted to add that comment to the discussion. I don't think it applies to this scenario, because Amazon and Whole Foods make up a whopping 3% of the retail grocery market."
