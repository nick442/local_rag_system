Scientists and Engineers earn very well, are proud of their contributions and have safe jobs that grow with them. MBAs, in my long experience, mostly lose their jobs because of the blanders they cause, have very stressful jobs, and their jobs are totally dependent on kissing the ass of the one above them.
