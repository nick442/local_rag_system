if your end game is corporate, a PhD might be a bit overkill (source: phd holder who works in banking). if you want to be very technical (coding, analytics, quant finance), then the PhD might make sense. if that isn’t you and you don’t want academia, don’t do it. the phd is a really long haul. MFin gives you a stronger theoretical framework than an MBA, however for recruitment, MBAs tend to fare better and more easily getting into finance. the CFA in theory could fill in the finance gaps missing in the MBA. at any rate, if you’re dedicated and persevere, you’ll get wherever you want to be in due time with any of these choices.
