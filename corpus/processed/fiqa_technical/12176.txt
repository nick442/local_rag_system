Actually, economists (including Krugman, that posterboy of reddit) [said as much when Bush did those pre-recession](http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/27/a-note-on-the-bush-fiscal-legacy/) (I know he posted about it earlier but can't find it now). EDIT: [Boom](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/11/opinion/11KRUG.html) The general guidance is get revenue during a boom so that you have fiscal levers in times of a recession. Bush basically set up the economy pre-recession so that those levers were taken away, between the tax cuts and the wars.
