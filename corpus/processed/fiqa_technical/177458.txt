It's one thing to have investments and own businesses. What's happening with Trump is not exactly that simple. Maybe I'm mistaken but I can't think of a single instance of a sitting president owning a company that does direct business with the government. Please, correct me if I'm wrong. How that could not be a complete conflict of interest (and very, very illegal) is beyond me.
