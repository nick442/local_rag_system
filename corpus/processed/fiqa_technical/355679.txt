"If one looks at the ""Guide to Information Returns"" in the Form 1099 General Instructions (the instructions that the IRS provides to companies on how to fill out 1099 and other forms), it says that the 1099-B is due to recipient by February 15, with a footnote that says ""The due date is March 15 for reporting by trustees and middlemen of WHFITs."" I doubt that exception applies, though it may. There's also a section in the instructions on ""Extension of time to furnish statements to recipients"" which says that a company can apply to the IRS to get an extension to this deadline if needed. I'm guessing that if you were told that there were ""complications"" that they may have applied for and been given this extension, though that's just a guess. While you could try calling the IRS if you want (and in fact, their web site does suggest calling them if you don't receive a W-2 or 1099-R by the end of February), my honest opinion is that they won't do much until mid-March anyway. Unfortunately, you're probably out of luck being able to file as early as you want to."
