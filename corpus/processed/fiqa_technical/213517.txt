"I think you just don't understand what ""intrinsic"" means. It's not an opinion. It's a fact that currencies like the USD and EUR have no intrinsic value. That doesn't mean they're worthless, they just have no intrinsic value. Technically dollar COINS have intrinsic value, because they're a piece of metal that can be used for something else. Dollars itself however don't have intrinsic value."
