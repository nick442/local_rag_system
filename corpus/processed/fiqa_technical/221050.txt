As you already mentioned, a traditional 401K is tax-deferred, so you don't pay any taxes on the money in the account until you retire. A Roth 401K has already been taxed, so you don't pay taxes on withdrawal (assuming you withdrawal after 59 1/2 years of age) The Roth 401K is advantageous if you believe you'll be in a higher tax bracket than you are currently. This applies more so if you're out of school and your income is relatively small, but you think in 10-15 years you'll be making enough money to fall into the next tax bracket. In essence, you can use a Roth 401K as a way of diversifying your retirement money across different tax structures.
