It'd be a stimulus so yes. It would create demand for labor, research, materials and what not that will result in more jobs/productivity. Even if climate change isn't real, harnessing alternative sources of energy has alot of benefits. It diversifies the energy sector so that we're not reliant on just one source. See how countries like Saudi Arabia and Venezuela put all their eggs in one basket by just focusing on oil as their main driver. When oil crashes, so do oil based economies. Renewable energy like wind, solar and even nuclear can be clean which means less pollution to clean up and easing the burden of healthcare and improving quality of life. When places are clean, you'll see more uptick in tourism, healthier people going out more, which ultimately leads to more economic activity. If a war can be considered an economic stimulus, building renewable energy resources and the accomodating infrastructure should be too.
