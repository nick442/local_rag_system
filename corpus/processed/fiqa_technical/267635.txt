No. Our taxes allocated the resources necessary for us to have roads, power, and all the nice facilities we use. The rich benefited from the government offering them the jobs to build these things. Or did you forget about that part? You sound like you think the rich are altruistic. If they were, would we really be in the situation we are today, with the increasing wage gap and people distrusting big business? No. We would laud big business as our saviors and protectors, would have confidence that big business is there if we fall down, to pick us up. But big business has shown it is more about back stabbing than helping.
