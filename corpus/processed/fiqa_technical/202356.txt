"Let's (again) re-phrase this: * Before I went to college, I *knew* that ""A"" was the answer. * In college, I discovered that ""B"" was the answer. If ""A"" was the answer, you would have stuck with it. Instead, you went with another answer, ""B"". We can only assume, then, that you were incorrect about ""A""."
