>it was only about ten years ago that a typical coke machine took coins and charged about 50 cents, a loaf of bread could be had for 35 cents at Aldi and gas was about $1.50 per gallon. I'm pretty sure the bread and the Coke were more expensive than that. I remember 10 years ago that a Coke cost a dollar. Now it costs $1.25, or $1.50 if you're in an expensive location that likes to rip people off for convenience.
