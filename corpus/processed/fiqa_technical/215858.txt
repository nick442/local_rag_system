"One of the big PC boys (Dell or someone like them) did the whole ""call metrics"" thing, and finally put out the word that if a tech's average call time went over 12 minutes, they could look for new work. Support costs skyrocketed. It didn't take much digging to find out why - your average can't go over 12 minutes if no call goes over twelve minutes. So support reps would try to help a customer for 11 minutes, then just send them a new computer."
