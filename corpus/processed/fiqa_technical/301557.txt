"Absolutely this study should be taken into account. As the study suggests, there should be further study into the possible link between glyphosate and myeloma. I would go as far as to say the science of just about anything moderately complex is never settled, and continued research and study is always warranted and encouraged especially when it impacts our wellbeing. However, I would point out that this study spends a great deal of time explaining that while an association is ""possible"", there are also many other factors that may be falsely leading them to that interpretation. In the end this paper stops far short of making a concrete link between glyphosate and any form of cancer. The State of California on the other hand is making a very definitive statement that they ""know"" glyphosate causes cancer. I don't think we ""know"" this at all, and the data in support of such a conclusion is extremely limited and weak at this point."
