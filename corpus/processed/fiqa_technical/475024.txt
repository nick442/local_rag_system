As /u/beatarmy99 mentioned, EMH is a theory base very much so in how economics every single individual is considered a rational being. It doesn't (and wasn't ever) mean it's intended to be applied in practice as it will never cover generalizations of humans in the market (like using generalized round numbers for option lots).
