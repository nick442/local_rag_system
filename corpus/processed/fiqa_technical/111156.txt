I have an interview coming up for an investment operations position. As someone who's fresh out of college, and who doesn't have the qualifications to get into the front office, I've realized that I'll probably have to take a job in the back office. The pay for this job would actually be solid, especially for the area so I am not disappointed with that. Ideally I'd like to be a financial analyst though. If I were to get a job in the BO (at this point point I'd access the offer if one was made) how can I make sure I don't get stuck for the next 30-40 years?
