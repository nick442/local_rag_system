There would be multiple competing courts looking for people's business based upon who could best interpret laws and contracts. On the contrary, courts exist because people *do* want to be there. They are people who cannot come to an agreement on their own. If a person is a hardened criminal, they aren't going to want the court system at all. Those people are in the vast minority. The notion of a market monopoly is a myth. The market by and large does not monopolize, and examples of monopoly don't last long. In terms of the court system and justice, no, states do not work. Police often get away with actions that would be considered criminal for the rest of us, and politicians get the same treatment. The examples of police brutality going unpunished or political action being widely opposed and still being pushed through are too numerous to list. Again, those who would loot and destroy are in the minority. If a person has the mindset that they want to harm person and property then they don't care about whether or not there is a state. They can only be stopped by force, and force can come from any entity with the legitimacy of using it. In that arena, there is nothing special about the state. They wouldn't have any right to restrict your freedom except to the extent of stopping you from violating the person and property of others. They don't need a constitution for that. > Everything would just devolve into constant warfare between groups - until a single group outperformed the others of course and boom you've got a government again. This is pure fiction. You have no evidence nor reason to actually support this. We're talking about reality, not conjecture. If you want to claim such nonsense then [you have to prove it.](https://mises.org/library/wouldnt-warlords-take-over) You can't just throw out such propaganda and expect it to be taken as fact.
