Household budgeting is about giving a job to your money before you spend it. Having it zero-sum means that you've assigned all your money coming in to whatever tasks you've decided align with your financial priorities. That means that if you start with money in the bank, then that money needs to be assigned jobs as well - it's likely that if it's savings, then its job will be to wait around until needed for things like car repair, home repair, vacation, etc.
