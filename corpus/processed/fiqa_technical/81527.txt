"Right. Because there was no profits. The company managed to grow by keeping very tight control of costs with respect to revenue. It's not a loophole. The alternative is spending less or charging more. Either of these things probably has significantly worse outcomes to the company - slower growth due to lack of reinvestment in the business, or slower growth due to not attracting as many customers through competitive pricing. What they have done is become a very valuable company due to a strong revenue stream. (You can ask whether a strong revenue stream alone is enough to justify their valuation, but investors seem to think so, and it also seems to indicate that they expect the stock price to continue rising or they wouldn't spend that much.) When Amazon started, I remember people joking ""they lose money on every sale, but they make up for it in volume"". Seems to have worked out for them in the long run."
