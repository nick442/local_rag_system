">The system is designed to defend teacher compensation and provide job security as the first priority..not to provide the best education for our kids. BINGO. It is designed to reward ""union loyalty"" and ""union involvement"" -- because by definition, those things tend to be (inherently) far higher in teachers with seniority (younger teachers are not so ""vested"" in their interests, and still have the possibility of shifting careers, things which lessen as people age). In short it is an entirely ""political"" thing (within the unions), and politically, the older union members outweigh and outvote the younger ones (plus, of course, the older members tend to be in charge of the negotiations)."
