"Entrepreneurship is the solution. Everyone just wants ""a job"". Why not make your own, then eventually provide jobs for others? Stop thinking of life as a random string of jobs until you retire. Create, invent, and provide something useful to society. You'll have a happier life and you'll be bettering this world."
