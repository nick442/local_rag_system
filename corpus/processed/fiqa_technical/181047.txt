The post-war US was riding high as the lone major non-bombed industrial power, we had all the steal plants, all the car plants, we had everything and we were supplying everyone. By the 60s the world had rebuilt from the war, and they rebuilt with newer factories than our pre-war ones. Suddenly we weren't the only option around, we had lost our competitive edge simply by the fact that the rest or the world had rebuilt. By the late 70s and early 80s it wasn't just first world nations we were competing against any more, the rest of the world was catching up too. Countries had come from no where to be actual competition. Long story short, the 50s and 60s lifestyle was a result of us not being bombed out, we aren't going to get that back. Plus now we aren't just competing with western Europe and Japan, we have half the damn world as competitors with the other half following behind. And sadly technology, while awesome, is allowing one person and a computer to do the job of what used to be 5 men keeping wages down even more. I don't have an answer, but I doubt that kind of lifestyle is coming back for the mainstream any time soon.
