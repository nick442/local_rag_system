"National City Bank did great on subprime. They bought First Franklin for around $100m, took millions out in profit for about a decade, and sold first franklin for $1b to Merrill Lynch. What killed NCB was home equity lines or credit, 2nd liens, which were given to high scoring conforming borrowers. But when the panic set in the media told people ""dont pay your mortgages, the government will bail you out"" and people stopped paying on their 2nds. Values dropped and in order to foreclose on a 2nd you have to buy out the 1st lien too.. not possible. That killed the NCB balance sheet and the sharks in DC all but forced NCB to capitulate to PNC and be acquired for cheap."
