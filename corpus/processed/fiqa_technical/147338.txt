"You want to be an analyst? Do you mean. Equity research analyst? Investment banking analyst? Financial analyst? Etc.. The CFA alone isn't going to help you. I don't know why people on this board are obsessed with it. It's something you do while you are in school or once you get a job and looking to move to VP/MD level, not while you're job searching. Relevant experience > CFA, all day every day There's always some guy who says ""*BECAUSE* of my CFA candidacy.."", well you're in the minority."
