That is interesting too! I'm wondering all the different reasons these correlations could exist. Maybe a lot of men more feel pressured to make money than most women do. And then for the fitness thing, maybe women feel more pressured to look a certain way. The pressure coming from society in general, I mean. Just my guesses though.
