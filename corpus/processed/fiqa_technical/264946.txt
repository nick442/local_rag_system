its sad that I am getting down voted because people disagree with me. I'd like the people that disagree with this notion first read this: http://pragcap.com/understand-the-modern-monetary-system/understanding-modern-monetary-system Most people in this country just have no idea how this economy works and what role the federal reserve plays and what role the government is supposed to play. Please read this and then respond to me yea?
