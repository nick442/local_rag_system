Paul supports multiple competing currencies, not just gold backed dollars. From his standpoint and predictions about the governments actions his investments are predictable and have quite certainly turned him a very nice profit. The fact that he doesn't have bonds is a no-brainer. He doesn't support facilitating increased US debt and spending even if it's to his own benefit. I think the fact that he doesn't hold bonds is actually pretty honorable. He also was one of the few people to predict the current economic situation we're in and he invested accordingly. The article talks about how he's lost some money in the last few months but that's a terrible way to look at it since he's held most of these positions since 2006 and gold and silver have skyrocketed since then. Yes this is a less diversified portfolio than most would have, but it just further solidifies my opinion that Paul really believes what he says. He put his money where his mouth is in the face of many doubters screaming that he's a crazy idiot and was not only proven right but made a good bit in the process.
