As someone who hasn't been on a vacation in 4 years and is budgeting food on a week-by-week basis, I think you need a good look on the mirror. You might not be trying to sound snobbish, but the fact that you have the audacity to claim that while detailing how pretentious you are just makes you sound vain and petty. From the majority of Americans: fuck you. You shouldn't feel good about yourself.
