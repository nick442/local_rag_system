"Right? I was like ""how the hell can they possibly prevent that?"" Then, when I saw that it occurs when using their in-store WiFi I was like ""who the hell bothers to connect to WiFi in a grocery store?"" I, personally, make it a point to never connect to any public WiFi at all for security reasons. If I don't have good enough cell service to comparison shop I take pictures of the tags and do it outside. Again, though, why would I ever comparison shop at a grocery store? I'm talking more about a couch or something."
