"I mean, this would apply to every person of any consequence in the country ever. Every president, every fed chair of every branch, every lead economist, every senator. There is *always* some ""moron"" who thinks they know better for some simple reason. If someone proposes stimulus, there's some guy somewhere that's like ""This guy is a fool."" If the same guy the next day proposes austerity measures, some other guy will be like ""You're missing a very simple and obvious thing that I learned on the internet."" So. I would assume that Bernanke would answer your question with a simple ""No. There's a reason why I'm the Fed chair, and they are not."" It's when the people of high mental fortitude begin to question his conclusions that he needs to worry. I do think he has a responsibility to back up his actions with results, though."
