"IN 1986, the NCAA decided Southern Methodist deserved the harshest penalty ever given to an athletic program. It was decided that they not only committed violations, but they committed the same violations that they were currently in trouble for. SMU recieved ""the death penalty."" They were not allowed to play football for one year, not allowed to have home games for another year, extensive probation, limited staff, and not allowed to recruit. I think Wells Fargo needs the death penalty. Every branch needs to close for 1 year (except for account transfers), every ATM needs to close for 2, extensive probation, limit the number of executive-level positions to half the previous number, and they are not allowed to advertise hiring or recruit for a year."
