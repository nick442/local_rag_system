Frederic Mishkin wrote a few text books on financial concepts that are widely used in colleges. If you're not looking for a textbook - I'd really recommend Khan Academy on YouTube. He's got some great videos on supply and demand - bonds, exchange rates - monetary policy by the federal reserve. All academically sound. They're very easy to digest and watch over again for reference.
