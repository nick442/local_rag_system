One could make the argument that hiring generally was something which companies should do as little of as possible. So, looking twenty years ahead, unless we as a nation and generally, it applies also to the whole human race, **unless we set our sights a great deal higher than they are today, businesses just won't need practically any employees.** And if we do set our sights higher, the employees businesses *will* need will be much more skilled than most of them are today. There just wont be any need for a lot of people no matter how eager they are to work, they just wont have any skills that a computer can't do better.
