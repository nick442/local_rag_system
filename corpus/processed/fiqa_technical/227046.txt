"The dividend reinvestment won't change whether the dividends themselves are qualified or not for US income tax purposes. It's still the holding period on the stock that matters. If you bought stock in different lots, then you could have a situation where some of the dividends paid are qualified and some are not, but: For completeness, it's worth noting that some dividends cannot be ""qualified"" no matter how long you hold them, but if you've got an investment in a common corporate stock (vs. something more ""exotic""), then what's above should apply."
