Sponsorship isn't the problem as much as it is all of the planted articles, astroturfed/shilled discussion and artifical pretending to be organic. Brands and special interests don't just want to buy commercials and ads, they want you to write an organic seeming article where they are mentioned positively (ahem Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos).
