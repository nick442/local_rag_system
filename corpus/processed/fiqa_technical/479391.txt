>Gosh this certainly won't drive piracy underground in some modern day version of an alcohol prohibition where bars were shut down. Speakeasies required discretion in order to be successful. I don't think that the most recent generation possesses the abilities to both keep a secret or exercise discretion. There have been places to get free movies and music for years, but everyone thinks access to those products are a human and civil right and can't keep their mouths shut about it.
