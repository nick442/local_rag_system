"i dont see what's the big deal, all the banks got bailed out. Govt printed over 7 trillion bucks, not much inflation. govt has to help private sector. gave plenty of freebies to the rich mother fukers in the banking sector. or even better, govt should tax the shit out of wall street and super rich corporations and use that money to give to the students. how do you suppose the govt ""FIX"" the economy?? wtf do u think govt is trying to do? but they gave the money to the wrong people."
