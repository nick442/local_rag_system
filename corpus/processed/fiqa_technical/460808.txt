Well, don't turn the exception into the rule. Not everyone can make it into college, or make college work, or afford it. Not everyone can work 45 hours a week while going to school full time. For some people thats too much. Maybe they have kids. Maybe they have sick family members they care for, maybe they don't live on a bus route.
