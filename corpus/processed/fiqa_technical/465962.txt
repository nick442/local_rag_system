Yeah, not a good chance you'll break in from a US school. I'm studying in the region and there's still a lot of uncertainty about how my future looks, given the language barrier. I'm not sure I'll ever be fluent to the point I sound like a native, and I think that might be what they want, at least for front office roles.
