I was listening to Marketplace this morning and this young social worker was talking about her life and how hard it is to start the family she wants since her student loans are $2100 a month. How the hell is that even possible? That's $25k a year with I'm assuming 10 years to pay it off. She borrowed nearly $200 grand to become a social worker?
