Yah..so the collapse of the housing market wiped out a generation of wealth in this country. Part of that was consumers signing onto toxic mortgages. The other part were banks willfully mischaracterizing toxic assets. So I get the argument we need less regulation , but your asshole cronies also were a huge part of why so many people lost everything. Now, because of a generational loss of wealth, student loan debt, and stagnant income, our society is forever changed. The gap between the rich and poor isn't sustainable. Now maybe regulation is part of why we haven't built pieces back. However, let's not forget that lies by banks were a big reason we are here. Most people have less than 1000 in savings and many, many people have lost all the equity in their home. Then, hedge funds bought up tons of real estate for dirt cheap and now charges rent. So, for most Americans, rentals and perpetual debt are the norm. So.i get it. We need smart regulation, but this asshat doesn't know what it's like for most of America. His industry keeps the economy going, but also fucked it beyond recognition.
