> Theoretically you'd expect the exchange rate to move against you enough to make this a bad investment. Actually, the theoretical and intentional expectation is that the currency with the highest interest rate should appreciate even more. Canada has traditionally offered an interest rate premium over the US specifically to help the strength of its currency and attract capital to stay there. > In reality this doesn't happen Because carry trades/fx have so little margin requirements, and so many speculators on one side of the trade, there is a significant short squeeze risk any time there is a de-risking shock to the economy. Any unwinding impulse, scares other carry trade participants to unwind, and then forces many more to unwind.
