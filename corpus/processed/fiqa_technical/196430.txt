Madagascar would seem to be a better comparison of what a country would look like if colonized by Africans rather than Europeans. In fact, when Africans first crossed over the Mozambique channel to reach Madagascar, they found there were already an indigenous population living there (who had come from Borneo/SE Asia) centuries prior. This is very similar to how Europeans found Native Americans. So, how is Madagascar doing? Somewhat better than Zimbabwe, but only barely. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_African_countries_by_GDP_(PPP)_per_capita
