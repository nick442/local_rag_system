"Realistically, fair is whatever you all mutually agree upon. Some people can do means based splits, some people can't. My recommendation is to split things evenly, based on actual used space or usage. Do you have a 2BR with similarly sized rooms? Break it up by room, so in this case your GF and you pay 50% and the other person pays 50%. Maybe there's a garage or one BR is bigger. I've seen splits not 50-50 based on these factors. You may consider paying a third all around for rent but I would try to avoid solutions that are not usage based. If you don't and try for a ""means"" based split, best case scenario is nothing really is different. But the worst case scenario is setting yourself up to be taken advantage of - because you are effectively subsidizing other people, this often changes relationships. Not always, but often. Frankly, the best option here is to find a place that is more affordable for everyone. Trying to make it so that your GF and roommate are not going to be in a difficult financial place by living with you, it resolves all the problems here."
