Unemployment is meant for people who were laid off, not terminated. Also, the employee who claimed unemployment did so even after they had worked for another company for several months between working for me and making the claim. If I actually laid someone off I would be the first to personally help them fill out paperwork for unemployment benefits. If those benefits go to those who shouldn't receive them it hurts everyone. That 3% increase in unemployment insurance is 3% that isn't going into paying my actual employees.
