I mean, yeah, that is true. Your point is a valid concern and I do think it could potentially reduce the number of EU students studying in the U.K. It is something the British need to keep an eye on over the next decade. But think about it .. to go to the US to study as a European, you need a student visa as well and our influx of foreign students coming to study in America continues to grow. You need a student visa to go pretty much anywhere in the world besides the 28 EU countries. I think the main factor is having a strong university network as a nation and the U.K. definitely has that. They had it before the EU was even created. As long as the U.K. has that strong education foundation, people will continue to study there. Not to mention, students go for the added benefit of improving their English skills. https://www.google.com/amp/www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/11/12/record-number-of-international-students-studying-in-u-s/%3famp=1
