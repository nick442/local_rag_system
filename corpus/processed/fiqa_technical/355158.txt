"Expanding like crazy compared to what? Apple? You mean the company that has maintained a 25% operating margin while growing top line by 160% since 2010? No company has EVER had a market cap of $1T, let alone maintained it. What is your point? All you're talking about is relative price and ""history"" which has little to no bearing on what is going to happen in the future. I see no indication of any argument related to the actual valuation of Apple stock. It is still, at $650B, pretty reasonably valued considering the facts, e.g., ability to generate cash, maintain margins, grow revenues, and for management to make sound financial moves, i.e., return $ to shareholders. You come off extremely condescending yet you seem not to have much of an understanding in regards to what dictates stock price over the long term."
