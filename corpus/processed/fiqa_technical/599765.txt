>Case in point with Uber: Let's say you decide you want to drive for UberX. You lease a Prius, and thus are on the hook financially for $350/month + $100/month insurance + $300/month gas and other car expenses, and you'll have that for three years. That's a $750 nut. I'm not that familiar with the workings of Uber, but I assume people wouldn't lease a car specifically to become an Uber driver. I figured Uber drivers were people who already had cars. If you'd be paying a car lease anyway, driving for Uber doesn't really add that much to your costs.
