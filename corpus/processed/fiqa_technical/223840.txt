What?! According to that article's description, ANYONE can take advantage of the Post Office. But the article tries to make it look like Amazon is the only one making off like bandits from it! What the one-sided argument are you trying to feed me here? That's still free market. I think you should look for the flaws in the articles before you accept their narrative. Every article has flaws. If you know what they are, you can shore them up with other proof that backs up the weaknesses, or you can dismiss the article as worthless. In the case of this article, I'm afraid I must dismiss it as worthless. It is selling a narrative that the Post Office is catering to Amazon, when it is clear that Amazon is simply abusing the Post Office the same way any company can, and probably does.
