There is a much simpler explanation. Resources unlike human labor are scarce. As we use up resources the price for these resources rises. In an effort to keep prices low, wages are not increased. This leads to effectively less spending income. Automation and advancement only slow the process. Labor is in no short supply, the price of labor will continue to fall in order to keep the price of final goods lower.
