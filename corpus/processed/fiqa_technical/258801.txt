They have dug a deep hole with bad products and support. Had a all-in-one desktop with next day on site support. They hadn't fixed it after several weeks. Call one support person they would claim its a problem of another department. They don't dominate the printer market anymore either. Will not touch HP equipment at any price any more. Can definitely see writing off their good will.
