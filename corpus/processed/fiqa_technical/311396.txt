The Westminster government said it wouldn't carry out a currency union and the Scottish government said we'd have no liability over the debt if we don't get the assets of the Bank of England. If we reject the debt will that have any realistic consequence on investors? I thought the number one thing investors loved is an oil rich country with stability.
