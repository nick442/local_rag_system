The virtual classrooms won't replace the expensive schools at the high end (for many of the reasons you describe). They'll compete on the low end with public schools. I agree it won't happen in the near future -- it'll happen when prices get so high that there's a significant increase in student loan defaults. That will be the breaking point, and people will start to look for alternatives.
