This long winded response could be down to this: non lawyers from New Hampshire get surprised by Florida lawsuit. Decided to fight it without a lawyer, gets surprised when lawyer knows more than them. Waits until it's too late and then looks for a lawyer who ends up conflicted out. The advice we always give when someone has a legal problem: hire an attorney. These people didn't follow the advice and got burned by their own ignorance. This isn't about buying justice. This is about idiots thinking that they know it all.
