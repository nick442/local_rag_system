"They deserve jail just for their stupidity. How dense or oblivious do you have to be to hold a position that high up and still not be aware of the potential consequences. I worked finance for a public company as a lowly employee but I don't dare touch the stock or its options no matter what I know. And these are so called ""executives"". Jail them and burn these mofos assets."
