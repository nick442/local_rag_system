> growth doesnt come from people hiding in safe havens. it comes when investors take risk. And investors don't take risks when they find it difficult to calculate, like when policies are continually changing, when regulations grow by the day, when the cost of doing business (such as employee health care) are unknown. This is pretty much exactly what fiscal conservatives are saying is wrong with our current U.S. administration and economic climate.
