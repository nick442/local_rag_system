" Crumbling infrastructure after decades of insufficient funding and maintenance throughout the country. Crumbling"" gets thrown out a lot. Just because we don't build high speed trains that we cannot afford doesn't mean our infrastructure is crumbling. We have the best freight railroad network in the world, the best highway system in the world, and cities all over the country are heavily investing in mass transit."" Wait - how many bridges collapsed in the past few years? How many more need major renovation or replacement? How many water mains broke last year? How stressed is our power grid? Infrastructure goes way beyond the rail systems."
