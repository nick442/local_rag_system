"You know, we really shouldn't be paying $1 for a single track. I mean, if we were being serious about paying artists what they deserve, it should be like $5 per track. The whole ""album"" model is overrated and obsolete, it was invented for record labels, not artists. And the $1 per track pricing is based on album pricing. Albums should cost a lot more than $20, and tracks should cost a lot more than $1. Musicians spend a significant amount of time on perfecting their craft. I'm not suggesting we each pay them an hourly salary for each song, but a few more bucks per track would not be unreasonable."
