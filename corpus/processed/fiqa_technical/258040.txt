"Yeah, that's pretty much what I read. ""Bloomberg said.."" oh, okay, it must be the EXACT OPPOSITE of what he said. Pretty much. I can see a need for visas in a few cases. Namely, positions in which the pool is so small that there are not 600 openings in the entire country, LET ALONE 6,000 at one company. I'm talking positions so exclusive that you can list all the candidates in the world in what would pass for an anemic travel brochure at first glance. Most of these are just companies saying ""We don't want to pay market price for employees, so we'd rather import."" Well, tough shit."
