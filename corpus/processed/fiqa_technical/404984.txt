>You mean Gary Johnson, he was not a libertarian, he was a republican. Gary Johnson was a Republican in title only. In the current political climate you have to have an R or a D next to your name to have a chance. It doesn't have to always stay that way. >Your opinions are a drop of ink in an ocean. Change them and contribute among the vast, vast majority of Americans who believe in a nation state or knowingly continue spouting your ideology which will amount to nothing. Translated: Become a sheep or choose to think for yourself.
