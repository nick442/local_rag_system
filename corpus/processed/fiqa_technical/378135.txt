Be persistent, be entrepreneurial, never stop pushing. Also be proactive in every way you can. Go read that book. Go meet people in the industry. Does a friend have a friend who works in the industry? it doesn't matter if he doesn't have any job openings. Meet 15 minutes for a coffee just to introduce yourself. If there is an opening in the future I can guarantee you that person will in their head review who they met with before looking at resumes - people remember faces.
