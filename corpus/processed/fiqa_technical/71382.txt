Both the PS3 and the PS4 allows the user to swap the HDD for an SSD without voiding the warranty and step-by-step details can be found in their respective instruction manuals and online. Their examples assume you are merely swapping between different HDD but and SSD is equally suited for these systems. Only problem, if you can call it that, is that these consoles and their games are already designed so that the storage drive isnt a massive bottlenecks but you still see a few seconds of speed improvements. Like instead of 15 second load time you see 13-14. Probably noticeable but its not a mind blowing difference and a casual user would probably not notice. If we were talking about 50% reductions it would be something most people would notice. Its also worth mentioning that all old cart based system are SSD systems and work by you switching SSDs to play different games. These systems had extremely fast loading times but also far smaller storage when compared to disc based systems.
