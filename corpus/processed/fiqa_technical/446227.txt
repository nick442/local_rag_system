"> ""With a well-established brand, differentiated from other casual dining restaurants by its Garden Bar, we see significant opportunities to drive value for Ruby Tuesday,"" Aziz Hashim, the founder of NRD, said in a statement. This gives me hope that they aren't going to get rid of the salad bar (even if he did call it the wrong name..). That was the best part about Ruby Tuesdays. The burgers and other food may have been mediocre, but there was always something enjoyable about having a beer with a great salad bar."
