I can make that claim because I've dealt with negotiating with taxi insurance before. This doesn't have anything to do with the courts. This comes down to the driver and their insurance. Your regular car insurance doesn't cover commercial use. If you're using your vehicle for work, you have to tell your insurance company and then they adjust your policy. If you tell them you are running a cab service, they will straight up cancel your policy because there is an entirely separate insurance industry for cab companies. So, please, tell me more about the industry I worked in for 8 years.
