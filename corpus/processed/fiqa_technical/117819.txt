I like the user-driven aspect of Yelp. I can look and see a review posted last week that says such-and-such a business is still good. And it can be a restaurant or auto repair or a florist or an ice cream truck that sells meth out of an abandoned gas station. The idea of Yelp is still really good, it's just the corruption that's killing it.
