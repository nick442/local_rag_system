Well, I can tell you that Micro Center has my business because they still cater to enthusiasts. Their price on my 750W PSU was lower than online prices so I drove an hour out of the way to pick it up and bought a whole bunch of other stuff on the way out. I think I spent something like $600. As to how their price was lower than online prices, I have no idea.
