Singapore does well because? Zurich does well because? London is already a much larger and more versatile financial centre than anywhere you have cited (bar New York) or the above. Not all financial services require passporting and, as I mentioned,'it remains to be seen whether some arrangement can be reached that allows firms UK firms similar passport privileges within the EU that they currently enjoy. Finance is very different from trade and the City is far less vulnerable to this political divorce than British importers and exporters. Never mind that London is a much greater cultural hub than any would be pretenders. I work in finance, no one I know has the slightest inclination to move to Frankfurt. It'll take a generation for any city to build up the institutional knowledge, infrastructure and talent pool that exists in Greater London.
