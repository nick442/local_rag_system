There's lots more entrepreneurship in the Philippines it's just under the radar. Big business is controlled by a handful of oligarchs. #1 problem in the Philippines would be corruption in government, IMO, followed by their bad weather/geological situation, and then terrorism. These are all huge roadblocks to overcoming poverty on their own. That difficulty to officially start a business does make things harder, and unfortunately the smarter folks who live there often find a way to put their skills to use abroad.
