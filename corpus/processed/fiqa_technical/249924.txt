>The point of a business is to make a profit. End of story. Thats a narrow and short-sighted interpretation of business practices. The rest of your comment devolved into strawmen and bullshit so I'm not going to bother addressing it. Your links were equally irrelevant but I appreciate the fact that you at least *tried* to source a reasoned argument. You didn't succeed but at least you tried.
