"You need a GOOD *ERP* (or at least MRP II) implementation; which means you need someone VERY familiar with (or someone who *becomes* very familiar with) your business to get it done right. Those don't come setup for some unique business as an ""off the shelf"" thing; and while many are ""customizable"", you can easily end up in customization hell (both dollar-wise, operation-interruption-wise, and [technical-debt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt)-wise). But this really begs for someone to ask: **Why are you not maintaining & updating your existing custom software?** Why attempt to ditch something that is (hopefully) ""working"" fairly well, for the *highly risky* prospect of some entirely new (untested) system? Is the business-logic and the operation of the old system working well? While it might seem to be costly in terms of time & money, your BEST BET (in my experience) would be to get a REALLY GOOD programmer (possibly with a cheap assistant/temp helper to do some grunt work for him) to document, maintain, and then slowly upgrade your current (already in place) software (and/or rewrite it to use modern DB's, web interfaces, etc.) Because changing out your MRP system is like replacing all the arteries and veins in your body.. it will NOT be a pleasant experience (and the patient may not survive the operation, even if the implementation is a labeled a ""success"") -- the business graveyard is littered with the corpses of ERP/MRP victims. The ""big dogs"" have three HUGE upfront cost areas: 1. The ""consultants"" (in various teams/stages); 2. The underlying database/software costs (initial licenses); 3. The ONGOING licenses; 4. The ONGOING ""customization"" fixes (if you ever want to upgrade -- alas most of the consultants who do ""customizations"" don't do/document it in a way that facilitates easy upgrades -- in part because that would significantly reduce their income)."
