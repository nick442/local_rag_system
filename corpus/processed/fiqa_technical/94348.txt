> The single payer health care makes it so much easier to be a contractor or to create a startup. You have no idea how much I want a Single Payer for that exact reason. Also that it would allow everyone to have access to healthcare. Single payer would not only reduce healthcare burdens on employers but control the cost of healthcare. I hope we have a state by state implementation of Single Payer.
