I understand your anger. Still you should consider that the banks are a key factor in economic growth. Hurting them hurts us because its our money that makes them so rich. As for the feds..you suggest private regulation. Firstly its slightly absurd to have the feds, the regulator of private businesses, controlled privately. Secondly, atleast government is resonable with economic policy in fear of elections, private regulation would do whatever made the tresury and hence business more money. Think bailout without sec regualtions. There is no denying banking is a ethically dubious business but it is important to appriciate the complexity and genious of the economic system. Change is harder than outrage, it requires a stroke of genious both politically and economically.
