That broad figure is rather useless on its own. People buy mostly things they need right away. A useful analysis would a multi-variable one, graphing 3-way correlations of: - price - profit margin - average half-life of the product Maybe across a few separated categories, online vs brick-and-mortar, normalised towards the median and 3 standard deviations on each variable. These would be some neat graphs if only the data was available.
