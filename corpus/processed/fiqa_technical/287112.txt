My brother's wife does some pretty intense couponing. She recently posted on facebook when she bought about $300 worth of items for $30. It was almost all toiletries and food that her family uses regularly, though there were some items they've now got 3 months supply of. She told me that it is a pain to track and exploit all of the different coupons/discounts but the savings help to offset the cost of homeschooling 4 children.
