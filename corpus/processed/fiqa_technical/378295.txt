"And who can afford new high-density apartments? Rich people who run airbnb and rent out at the same crazy prices, foreign rich ""investors"" and large businesses who move into corprorate buildings. For the average joe who suffers the most from real estate bubble, the supposed solution of new motivated construction only becomes a solution after the bubble bursts, when the prices plummet and suddenly there's a lot of cheap but new apartments. Until then, when they actually need a solution there isn't one."
