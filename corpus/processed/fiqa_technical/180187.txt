To be honest I've had rather poor experience with unionized workers in the US.. I've seen union electricians wire emergency power off circuits backwards (such that they wouldn't work when the firefighters try to cut power to the facility, or wouldn't work when on battery power).. I've seen unionized construction workers seal garbage under a floor because they couldn't be bothered to pick it up (it was their own too, food waste). Other unionized trades that will just leave their garbage / cuttings / mess for someone else to clean up. From what I've seen / experienced Unions today are nothing like what they should be, protecting the most incompetent among them and constantly demanding increased wages for poor performance. Why should I have to pay someone more to do a shittier job just because they're in a members only club? Honestly, I cant think of any reason for minimum wage paying jobs to have a union. If you think the wages are too low for cost of living then the minimum wage should be raised. These people have no special skills, little to no training, and usually no education.
