I actually think it's the opposite. Outside the city is tons of infrastructure and there would be no traffic issues at all. As I said Raytheon had multiple large campuses in Tewksbury, woburn, Waltham, and Andover. It also has sites in many other towns. Amazon could set up shop just outside the city. Also if they were intent on being in the city they could probably find good space in the seaport district or southie.
