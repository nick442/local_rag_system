>Imagine Having to field unlimited additional emails from people outside of your own dept who perhaps don't know/understand how your dept operates/functions. Is the person who sent the email of any position for you to care enough to respond about how they don't know shit? If so, they're important enough to be helped along. If not, ignore them - at least, my initial skim through said that nobody was under any obligation to respond.
