I work for a private equity firm and recently graduated with a Master's of Finance from a top 20 B School. With that being said, I would not recommend the Master's as a path to PE or CF. You would be better suited to invest in a MBA from a target school. IB is very tough to get into with a MFin depending on the part/product of the bank you are targeting. Happy to answer more specific questions.
