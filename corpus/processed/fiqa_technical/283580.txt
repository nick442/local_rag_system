Wow. That's quite possibly the most ignorant thing I've ever read. So that confirms that you don't know anyone who follows that religion. You know, you could learn a lot if you turned off Fox News for a few minutes and spoke to someone who looks or worships differently than you. The internet could be a great tool if you did something other than read about things that confirm your (incorrect) assumptions about other people. For the entirety of our country, there have been people on the wrong side of history. People who were pro slavery, people who were pro segregation. You, my friend, are going to find out one day that you were the asshole spraying the fire hose. Pardon my bluntness, but you're a real piece of shit.
