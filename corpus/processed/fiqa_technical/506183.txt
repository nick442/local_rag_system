What is wrong can't be fixed by communism, education, unions, or new technology. These solutions all count on the problem being something it isn't. Early capitalism didn't work until we learned we needed to tax real-estate to keep the rich from draining our economies through their ownership and thus remove the value from work turning us into impoverished serfs. Today, we have expanded the range of things that can earn money for their owners far beyond simple land and buildings into machinery, patents, software, media, and all manner of technology. Furthermore, we've adopted a global policy of tax-free trade which removes our ability to tax these things. Until we adopt a political stance that treats profit as a drain on economic vitality and money seeking to earn more money as the enemy of our prosperity, the world's middle class will continue its descent into poverty.
