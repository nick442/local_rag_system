100% this. I have two BW3's in the area. One closed down and reopened in a new plaza. The one that closed was absolutely horrendous. Incorrect orders, raw wings, hair in food, etc. The other one was/is really good. I think the one that closed had to move due to it's poor reputation. Everyone would go out of the way to go to the one on the other side of town. Also, I went to one in St. Clairsville OH. Fucking horrible. Gross, worst service, and I got a raw chicken sandwich. All the manager could tell me was he would throw it back on the grill.. Are you serious?
