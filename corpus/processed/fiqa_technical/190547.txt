The first problem is your math. Unless you are paying cash you will have a mortgage. So you'll need to add interest expense. And you will have property taxes whether you pay cash or not. Cutting corners and delaying repairs helps with margins. So does raising the rent as often as you can. For most Americans real estate is a store of wealth, not a generator of it.
