Is she entitled to more of the equity because she made more? No. Equity should be determined by how much each paid. But she is entitled to more of the equity if she paid more. And that may be what she is saying. That she contributed more to the household's finances than you did. If you always paid the mortgage out of the joint account, you could presumably go back and look at the account to find out how much each of you contributed to it. That would give you a reasonable split for the remainder of the equity after your initial investment. If you both put your entire paychecks into the joint account every time, then it will be the same as the ratio of what you each made. That would also make sense for splitting up whatever remains in that account. While you're doing that, you may want to ask for more for your original $65,000. By my calculation, if your mortgage was 3.5%, that $65,000 saved the household more than $12,000 in interest that became equity instead. So you could reasonably bump your return on the initial investment up to $77,000 while making the concession on the rest of the equity. This is just a suggestion for a framework for splitting the equity. If you can agree on a split, it will almost certainly be easier than going to a mediator or court.
