I purchased a used (2011, low miles) sedan in early 2014 for ~28k, 9 months before moving to the city. I put 12k down including trade in and currently own 9k on the car (1.9% APR). It's a luxury sedan (not a 3 series, hah!) and will hold it's value better than other cars for quite a while (currently worth ~23k in private sale). 1.9% APR yet it costs you 50% APR to keep it. Regarding your logistical problem: Maybe you will go home/your parent's house less. Maybe you will make New York City your home. Even if there is something very serious (or interesting) 320 miles away, the rest of us also have to deal with this. Bus, train, Uber, arrange pickup at the train station with friend's/family. You can also subsidize flights and trains with promotional credit card miles.
