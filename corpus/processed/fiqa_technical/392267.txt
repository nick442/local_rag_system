He's definitely right, I buy a ton of stuff from Amazon, and get lots of problems both from Amazon.com and 3rd party items. I also sell on FBA and basically everyone of my shipments has some problem in the warehouse, either items get damaged or lost. Amazon will typically reimburse it, but it's still a pain. The worst thing that happened though was to a friend of mine, he had 2 private label products that were great sellers, he sent a shipment in and Amazon mixed it up with somebody else's stuff or something, and he got like 100 orders of both products where the customer got the wrong thing because of Amazon's error. They eventually paid him for the inventory beut his product got bad reviews and went from selling 20+ a day to 1 or 2 a week. Pretty much killed his business.
