You don't have an inherent right to spout hatred wherever you want, free of any consequences. You can, just like everyone else, apply for a permit and protest in a public square. But your rights aren't being infringed upon when private entities decide that your politics and rhetoric are distasteful and incompatible with them. Not all ideas are created equal, and white supremacy is incompatible with a civilized society. By all means, feel free to march down the street carrying racist signs and screaming about (((globalism))) and the deep state, but don't get pissy when polite society decides they want nothing to do with you. Internet companies have been policing free speech since the Internet was invented btw. Google and Facebook work closely with oppressive regimes all around the world, most notably China. I find it interesting that most people on reddit didn't care about that until they started drawing lines on hate speech in the USA and Europe.
