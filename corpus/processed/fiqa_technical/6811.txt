I think that *all* Washington Post articles that mention Amazon or Bezos include that ownership disclosure statement - it's form, no particular significance here. That said, I agree with you on both points: > I am leaning more towards the belief that Amazon registered for the patent to keep other competitors from using such a system > this is a very ominous and scary technological innovation I love innovation, but it's not always *used* well. This patent describes a bad use: spying on someone's communications to gain an economic advantage over them. (In the sense that if you are effectively discouraged from comparison shopping and pay a higher price than you would otherwise, they are advantaged to your detriment - potentially even without your knowledge.)
