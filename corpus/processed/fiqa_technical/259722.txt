"So, what's your actual plan/strategy/suggestion to combat this, again? Are you planning on buying physical gold, other precious metals (again, tangible--not paper), and buying & investing in real estate? This isn't a sarcastic question; I want to go down this hypothetical path in the thought experiment a bit further. For example: for a US investor, could *part* of the strategy be to ""move to a state with no state income tax"" to preserve as much income as possible in order to invest that income in one of the target categories? Is careful selection of primary residence (real estate) in a location most likely to appreciate part of the strategy? Is moving your investment accounts offshore to a tax haven part of the strategy?"
