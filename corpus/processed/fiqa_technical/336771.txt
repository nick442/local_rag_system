Because the US Energy Information Administration at the time was run by the Bush Administration, which loved fossil fuels but hated renewables, so they predicted that coal and oil demand would soar while renewables would stall. They also predicted that overall energy demand would rise (so we must dig more coal!) yet it actually fell due to efficiency improvements. One suspects they knew all their forecasts were complete crap.
