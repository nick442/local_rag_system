Most successful leaders are not born leaders. Various personal experiences and mistakes made along the way impact upon our leadership style and ability. For many of us, another perspective and a bit of constructive help along the way can add considerable value to the process, enabling us to fine tune our skills and learn how to get the best out of ourselves and fellow team members. In situations like this, an executive coach comes in handy.
