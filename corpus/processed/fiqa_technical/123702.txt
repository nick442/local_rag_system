Thank you for the links on VBA and R. I took several years of C++ programming in high school, so hopefully the concepts are similar. Initially I really wanted to get in to the investment side, but there aren't very many entry level investment related analyst positions that get posted in the Seattle area. If I only applied to the few investment related positions, I don't know if I would ever get a job, so I branched out to corporate finance as well out of necessity.
