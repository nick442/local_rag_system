In regards to your title, it's based on product. Rates based products had a late 2016 early 2017 run. It's now summer time and the fed is acting as expected. Clients have already positioned themselves going into the slow season. Distressed bonds and HY loans are still moving. After the latest fed increase and the yield curve flattening, HY loans took a hit. Par loans were trading at a discount. The market has moved back to paying a premium. However, HY bonds have been slowing down since June. New issue has dropped off, and equities have slowed as well. It's summer time. I wouldn't say that traders have it tough as the tittle suggests, it's just that it was a very active first quarter and now volatility has subsided. It's just the quiet season.
