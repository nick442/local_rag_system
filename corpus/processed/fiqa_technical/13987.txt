Political systems do not have to be intertwined with economic systems, as China demonstrates. By most rankings (Cato, Heritage, etc) China actually has a bit more economic freedom than India. I don't necessarily think that China's development path needs to be copied to India. But I would take a very strong look at what China has done and how. The results are unbelievable. If you think that India's democratic system is superior, then it should be even easier and faster for India to achieve similar or better results.
