I honestly don't see how this is any worse than games with in game purchases. It takes a special person to fall for these kinds of things. Generally that means older, less internet savvy consumers. I'm not arguing that this is right, but it seems like this is singling out one of these shady companies. There needs to be legislation enacted that addresses this conduct. It is going to be hard for people who lost thousands of dollars to show that they truly didn't know any better. Idk, weird issue. The commercials for dealdash were sketchy at best.
