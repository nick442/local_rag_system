Can you please expand on the Obama bailout BAC incurred in addition to the TARP and how much BAC has outstanding. I thought the only other assistance BAC received was part of the Making Home Affordable program, but that isn't meant to be recovered. [Here's a site that tracks every bailout program] (http://projects.propublica.org/bailout/programs/6-making-home-affordable). Maybe this will help you with your claim.
