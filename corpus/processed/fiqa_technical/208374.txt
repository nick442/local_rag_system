"My experience with different brands in the US this year is $250 and $400. If this is the differential in you choosing a brand for a rental, best to call the reservation number for each contender and ask what their hold will be. I am not sure what a ""definitive"" answer would be. There is a tension between ""risk mitigation"" and ""poisoning your brand reputation"" that each company will answer differently, and answer differently over time. Even an actuarial answer has to be transformed into company policy through competing soft factors."
