>What about public services that are in no way profitable for a company to run or manage? They shouldn't exist, at least not funded at the federal level. >How do you manage things like right of way? Duplication of services etc? Are we to assume that all actors will build in good faith and allow all to access these pieces of infrastructure. What happens if we clog up all the first few meters of underground with network cable and the one water company needs to upgrade piping to meet population needs? Who co-ordinates all these kinds of things to ensure it works well? How are these people paid? Where do their interests lie? In the event of a big highway project tearing through a neighborliness who represents the people of the neighborhood and ensures their interests are heard as well? Things can be managed without being completely funded and run by government. Zoning laws and such manage where different types of buildings can be built but the government is not the land developer, contractor, etc.
