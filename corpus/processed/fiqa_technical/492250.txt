Yep! The education industry has finally run into the brick wall. They have been selling snake oil for years. Get at Bachelors Degree and you will instantly get a great paying job. Uh, so we crank out 5,000% more communication degrees than are needed in the real world. The university administrators get their big fat bonuses and the port college graduate gets to find a way to payback their enormous debt. A study came out in the 80's which identified that approximately 10% of high school graduates should go onto college with about 40% graduation rate. The education industry has cranked the acceptance to around 75% of high school graduates with a graduation rate under 30% and over 50% of those graduating can't find jobs in their field. I met mechanical engineer, a mathematician and a social work in the past week. They all work at Target and trying to pay off their loans.
