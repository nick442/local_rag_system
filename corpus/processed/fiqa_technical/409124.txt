"If you have a president who thinks climate change is a fantasy, why should one waste time advising him on how to deal with it? And I know climate change has occurred throughout the time but not at this pace and is certainly to a large extend our fault. And can you explain to me what an advisory council represents? It's not meant to be there to fight for your ""ideas"". It is there to advise the president on how to act according to their knowledge. Let's be honest. He doesn't listen to the advice of the members. He made up his mind a long time ago. Correct me if I am wrong."
