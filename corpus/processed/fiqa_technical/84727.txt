"In the context of this thread.. the state level. In the context of your first comment; I would say the city level. But if you're comparing Baltimore and Booneville (wow, that's actually the name of the largest city in Owsley County Kentucky?) it's still apples and oranges. And much of that county is outside of any city limits.. In the context of your ""Government is not your nanny"" comment, well those are all at the national level.. So look at per-capita spending for national programs that cover both areas equally (e.g. Social Security or Medicaid/Medicare maybe?). Be careful citing overall welfare numbers that vary by state though (like food stamps or other welfare programs). So, what point are you trying to make? The data needs to fit that argument. Total wealth? Taxes paid at the same level (state / federal / city / county)? Amount spent on education? Median household income compared to cost of living?"
