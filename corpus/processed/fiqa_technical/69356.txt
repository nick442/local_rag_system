Pro-tip: managers hate to keep expensive cars on their books because expensive cars=more depreciation=bad margins. However, if you call the branch a day in advance/the morning of your reservation and mention that you are interested in coverages and upgrading to something sporty, you will instantly become a VIP for agents and managers that are desperate to boost sales numbers. They will do everything they can to track down whatever car you want. When you arrive, simply decline the coverages you don't want, and negotiate (seriously, negotiate) a fair price for your upgrade.
