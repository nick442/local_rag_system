Martin Shkreli was only able to do what he did, because of the stupid rules government put in place. There is a reliable generic today. Many, in fact. But you can't buy it because it's foreign. (Oh, think of all the poor Australians, Canadians, and Italians, dropping over dead from their unsafe pills! We can't allow that here! /s) It's $1 or less a pill in other first world countries with stellar pharmaceutical industries. Congress could fix it in 10 minutes but they don't. Shkreli played by the rules put in place.
