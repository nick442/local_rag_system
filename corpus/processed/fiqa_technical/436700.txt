100% agree. While some institutional knowledge will be gone with departing boomer retirees, it opens the doors to knew ways doing things, methods for improving a business function or covering the same workload in a new manner. The ship isn't going to go down because Billy Boomer gets his gold watch. I also believe new opportunities for entrapreneurs and other product or service providers will open up as result of those nest eggs being distributed. Hopefully the insurance companies leave something for the rest of the markets to compete over. Edit:typo
