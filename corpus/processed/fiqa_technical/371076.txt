Because all things being equal, unless they can pay the new graduate significantly less (which they won't be able to do, if the Millenials are still hard up for work), then employers will likely defer to candidates that they deem to be more mature. Additionally, Millenials won't just sit around; they'll work independently, take courses at community college to advance their knowledge, etc. At this point, I'd be more concerned about what happens if the economy DOESN'T return..
