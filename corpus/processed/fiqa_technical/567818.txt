"[Google is your friend](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=How+does+the+distribution+of+wealth+compare+between+the+States+and+the+rest+of+the+free+world%3F+&l=1) Scroll down to the section marked ""International Comparisons."" The short answer is, ""badly."" The reason, however, is that the US is a crazy rich nation where the richest people are _very_ rich, the poorest people are pretty damned poor, and the ""middle classes"" haven't gained a lot of wealth in the last 40 years. These are fairly unique features of the US. Most of the countries that are as unequal as the US are unequal due to access to important resources that are sold globally by well-connected important people. Or Britain."
