"That's just your bias. You'll get over it. Back in the 80s when cruise control was really taking off, people were scared of letting the car do that one task. ""What if it doesn't let go and keeps the gas pedal down?"" ""What if it decides to floor it and drive me off into a ditch?"" Today, almost every car has cruise control and you don't think twice about turning it on. It's proven itself with a safe track history, so you trust it. There are absolutely instances of cruise control failing, but statistically, those outliers don't matter. Full automatic driving will be the same way. You'll learn to trust it, even if it doesn't have a perfect record."
