Please expanded on your reasoning and which side you are defending (pro-DACA or anti-DACA). Allowing it to remain is a slight to legal immigrants and should have gone through Congress in the first place. That being said, to remove those here presently is far to costly of an idea to entertain, both monetarily and politically. Therefore a middle road is the route that must be taken.. and that requires active, and most importantly constructive, discussion. My first comment is purposely broad for this reason. Please detail a better solution that works for all parties.
