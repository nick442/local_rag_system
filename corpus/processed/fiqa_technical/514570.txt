I have an Econ BA, from a small liberal arts school. My experience is unique, but I'll share what I know. As a lone degree, job wise it's not as sought after as accounting, marketing, etc. Those roles are more tactical and immediately applicable in the roles new grads are hired into. Econ is bigger picture; more strategic in general. So for a company, as an Econ major your skills aren't as immediately applicable. Is econ worthless? Oh HELL no. Having that large perspective, and that understanding of how things are interconnected will help you throughout your career, and can be very insightful at times. Sadly it's not everyone's conversational cup-of-tea, but those higher in the org likely have an understanding and appreciation, although likely not the focused degree. Full disclosure, my undergrad didn't offer an accounting major, and the school had a great relationship with one of the big 4, so accounting was my goal immediately after graduation, despite it being an Econ degree. My program had many required courses heavy in accounting and quantitative analysis, so I'm not suggesting my econ is the norm.
