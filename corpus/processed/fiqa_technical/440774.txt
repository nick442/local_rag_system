Yes, that is correct. Note, when there is a tax treaty between Canada and the other country -- [which is pretty much anywhere you have active business](http://www.fin.gc.ca/treaties-conventions/in_force--eng.asp) -- the tax credits are equal to the income received, making it tax free. Here is a better explanation: > The greatest advantage of having a foreign affiliate in the international business setting is to repatriate foreign profits back to Canada tax free under certain conditions, for example, if a foreign affiliate carries on an active business in a designated treaty country (i.e. a country with which Canada has a tax treaty). The after-tax profit is included in a pool called “exempt surplus”. If the repatriation of profit in the form of dividend was paid out of the “exempt surplus” pool to a Canadian corporate shareholder, such dividend is included in its income and the same amount is allowed to be deducted in computing its taxable income. In other words, the dividend is not subject to Canadian tax if received by a Canadian corporate shareholder. [Source, p3](http://www.canadataxplan.com/test/canadataxplan/files/Book%20-%20English_summary_12-22-2008.pdf) Edit.. here from the NRC site: > Treaty Countries: **Active business income earned in a treaty country is classified as “exempt surplus.”** The exempt surplus of an FA also includes inter-affiliate dividends received out of the exempt surplus of other foreign affiliates, the exempt portion (25%) of all capital gains, and certain taxable capital gains. **Dividends paid out of the exempt surplus of an FA can be received free of additional taxes in Canada**, since the profits out of which they are paid are considered to have borne a rate of tax in the treaty country comparable to that of Canada.
