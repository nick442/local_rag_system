"Square use SSN to verify identity, and they only ask for the last 4 digits for that purpose. If she entered the full SSN - then she entered it into the tax id field, which was a wrong thing to do. It is also worth mentioning that since you mentioned a ""business partner"" that ""should have taken care of taxes"" that you should have a tax adviser whose job would be to take care of taxes and ensure that your interests are well-represented. I would suggest not to try interacting with the IRS on your own. Hire a tax adviser (EA/CPA licensed in your State) to do that. That tax adviser will be able to fix the problem (there are different ways of doing it, depending on the circumstances) and also verify that the business taxes were properly taken care of. When dealing with business partners - assume that what they've ""supposedly"" did was not done, until you see it with your own eyes. Saying that ""Supposedly, her business partner took care of all tax issues"" means, in this case, that you've been caught with unreported income that you tried to conceal. It is your (your sister's..) responsibility to prove otherwise. It is a very weak defense when the IRS comes knocking on the door for their money."
