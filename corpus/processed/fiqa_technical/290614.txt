Professors in universities sometimes do, but for every professor that makes a lot of money there are probably dozens of nontenured faculty who are barely making enough to feed themselves and put gas in their cars. The real reason the big corporate interests want to privatize US education is to use all those jobs as bargaining chips in globalization. that has been their plan for decades, they tried to do it in GATS, which could be seen as the first major attack on public services. That was in 1995. But GATS ""Mode Four"" was not used extensively because it had a minimum of I think $800k worth of the contract- so for structural reasons its never caught on.

Its going to effect a huge number of people in the US, the EU, and Australia. More than half of all jobs are service jobs. But its priorities seem to be all wrong. I am sure there are other, better ways for US companies to be afforded ""national treatment"" in the rapidly growing developing countries than TiSA.
