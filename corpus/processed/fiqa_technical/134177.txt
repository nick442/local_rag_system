We're talking about low paying jobs. and if there's more applicants than jobs than why are staffing companies HUGE right now? Across the entire country. Because can't fill the jobs like they want. There's absolutely a ton of demand for low paying workers all around. Places can't keep or find people even to stay for a month. Anyone that's ever applied knows these places also end up having tons of overtime because they don't have enough help. The only solution is to throw more people at those jobs. Your responding too fast. I did an edit I'm on my phone and alot of typos sorry. Your idea is to take all three of illegals , felons and potheads out of jobs yet somehow still filll these jobs that staffing companies have been trying to fill.
