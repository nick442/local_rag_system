Uber relies on a 3rd party service which is basically only slightly better than a Google search. It's a big sticking point because many cities conduct better more thorough background checks with their taxi drivers but Uber doesn't want that because it can sometimes takes months, and thus cut into profit. Not to mention even when Uber was starting out, surge prices easily made it cost 2-3x more than taxis during peak times. A lot of cities already solved this problem with taxis by forcing them to charge flat rates. A regulation that Uber simply ignored. Uber is basically one step forward (the app), two steps back
