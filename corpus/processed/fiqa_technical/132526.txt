I've personally gotten better experiences on Lyft going back at least a year and their drivers have said they prefer it to driving for Uber, even if it's obviously a small biased sample. That it's not as combative with city governments or drivers likely has helped its case even if not every potential investor or firm sees it that way just yet.
