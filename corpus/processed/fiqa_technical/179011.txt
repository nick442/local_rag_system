The American middle class came into being after WW2 ended and the govt relaxed it's economic restraints. The highest % of workers making min wage was 13.4% in 1979. http://www.seattletimes.com/business/real-estate/after-brief-slowdown-seattle-area-rents-surge-back-up-again-when-will-it-end/ >>Seattle is expecting nearly 9,000 new apartments this year — thousands more than any year in the city’s history — with even busier construction forecasts set for 2018 and 2019. >>“Given all this new supply, we expect the rental market will soften over the next couple of years,” Dupre + Scott said in its new report. >>Some of the construction is already making an impact. >>Neighborhoods where a lot of apartments have been built — like the greater downtown Seattle area, Ballard and Capitol Hill — all saw rents increase only about 5 percent year-over-year, well below the regional average, according to Dupre + Scott. >>On the other end, the biggest rent increases were generally in outlying areas, which have seen barely any new apartment buildings even as they generate more interest from locals priced-out of Seattle and the Eastside.
