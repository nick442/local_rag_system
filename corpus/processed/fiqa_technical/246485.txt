Hey Congrats on the Interview. I have been to the Manhattan office for their charity day. It is a very legitimate firm and you should really go for the job. My advice to you is to know your stuff and be prepared. I'm not sure exactly what the position entails but read over the job description and make sure you sell yourself. I tried to get an internship there when i went for the charity day. I went with one of the famous people that they invite every year and i spoke with the manager and met the CEO but when it came time to email them they just brushed me off and said that the position was full. The CEO is very well known and respectable up on Wall Street. I believe it would be a great opportunity however, it would probably be pretty cutthroat.
