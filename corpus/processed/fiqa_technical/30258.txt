"In what sense do you think that RBC contributed to the subprime mortgage crisis? You seem to take that as a given without providing any evidence. Through their ownership, at the time, of RBC Bank in Raleigh? RBC came out of the 2008 crisis as one of the strongest banks in the world. And I explained the nature of the temporary government cash infusion that happened while the world's credit markets were seized up. Calling it ""a bailout"" is just nothing less than misrepresentation. A ""bailout"" implies that mistakes were made by management. But that is not what happened. And the bubbly property markets in Vancouver and Toronto is irrelevant to your point of supposedly ""fact-checking"" Flashboys."
