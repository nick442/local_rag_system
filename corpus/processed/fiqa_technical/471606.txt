They are there, but they are insanely slow. A truck driver does not have to wait for the 100+ cars in front of him to bo unloaded. A truck driver does not have to wait for the rail line to be free. A truck driver does not have to wait for a locomotive to deliver the one car of product. For the same reasons people own cars, there will always be trucks. Rail lines simply can not reach eveywhere. Sending something cross country via rail can sometimes take 2-3 weeks. By truck it can take only a few days.
