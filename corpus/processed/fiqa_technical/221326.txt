Sure it's an issue. Not a legal one, but it's totally reasonable to not want to eat something because you think it's gross. That's the issue. Note that I don't believe there was any wrongdoing by any party here. It wasn't the best reporting, and I don't approve of the practice, but all parties were well within their rights.
