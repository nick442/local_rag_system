"**The 25% is an utterly meaningless statistic absent the age-demographic breakdown.** One would easily expect the 18 to ~30 year age group to have little in the way of savings (and the 18 to 30 year age group is > 20% of the population by itself). This is (like the ""upper X% have more net worth than the lower YY%"") yet another one of these idiotic/inane/misleading abuses of aggregate statistics. Also, this really isn't ""news"" in that it isn't anything *new* -- for the majority of Americans ""savings"" pretty much disappeared a couple of decades ago."
