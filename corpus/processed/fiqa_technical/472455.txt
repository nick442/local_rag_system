"I understand what you're saying, but two things persuade me on the McD's case: 1) I've spilled coffee on myself before. I did not need skin grafts. That tells me they were doing something *very* wrong. 2) When bean counters do the math on stuff like this, they do factor injuries into it as a cost. IMHO that means when you do hurt someone, you pay. When the woman first went to McD's all she wanted was for them to cover her medical expenses and they said ""Fuck off. Sue us."" So she did. They should've written her a check for her expenses plus $20k for pain and suffering, and gotten her to sign a gag order. Problem solved, walk away. Not doing that was arrogance and stupidity all in the same package."
