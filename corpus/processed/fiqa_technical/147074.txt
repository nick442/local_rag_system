No danger. You can get in a car accident, break your leg skateboarding, or otherwise wind up in the hospital like anyone else. You can also get the money back, with a tax penalty, but you probably will never need to if you are responsible and live within your means. Do you need a wake up call about what things can cost? I knew a college student who broke his leg skateboarding and didn't buy the ~$100/semester health insurance. He had to have a rod put in his leg and it was ~$30,000. Obviously he didn't have the money and the hospital agreed to put him on some kind of payment plan. I suppose bankruptcy was an alternative.. but either way, not a great way to start out in life. Any time you can defer payment of tax for decades or buy something with pre-income tax money, it is like instantly earning 20% (or more) on your money. I believe you can pay for eyeglasses and dental out of an HSA as well. So I wouldn't go overboard on an HSA or IRA if you have big credit card debts, if you do have room for savings it is dumb not to be putting money in the HSA and IRA/401k. Take a look at HSA bank for a low fee home for your money. They pay interest on over $3,000 (but like most banks, not much). The fees for being under $3k are currently around $2 a month. Don't worry about investing the HSA money until you have like $10,000 in there, which will be a while.
