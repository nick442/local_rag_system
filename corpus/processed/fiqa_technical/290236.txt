"The confusion comes from ambiguity in popular belief -- that businesses are required to accept x_y_x as payment. In reality, a business can state the terms of a transaction to their pleasure. On the other hand, debt is different -- no lender can refuse cash or other legal tender for repayment of debt. Sometimes, people try to split hairs and argue ""Well, if I eat a steak and I owe the restaurant $100, they should have to accept my $100 as tender for the debt of my meal."" Not true. The restaurant isn't giving you a line of credit, they're billing you after services rendered, and your payment is due on their terms."
