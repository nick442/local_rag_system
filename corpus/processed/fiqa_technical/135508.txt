Oil will not crash to $10 a barrel. Green movement in wealthy parts of Europe and North America all you want, but the majority of the worlds population resides in poor and shit places. Green energy will not take hold in these areas any time soon. Things as simple as recycling is still a very foreign concept to a good majority of the worlds population and you expect to change their infrastructure in the next few years? Decrease in oil dependency may be easy in SF, but have you seen fucking Arkansas? Vancouver's public transportation can easily support people getting out of their cars, but have you seen fucking L.A? Sure, more bike lanes for Copenhagen and coal free Denmark, but fuck me..AFRICA.
