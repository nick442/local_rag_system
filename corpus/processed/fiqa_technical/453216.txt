In my experience, Millennial's fundamentally distrust the the efficiency and efficacy of most of what is marketed in the modern economy. By the time you take the investors, marketers, and executive cut out of a modern product sale, there is simply nothing left to actually deliver a quality product, thus cheap, intentionally faulty shit is sold instead as a planned obsolescent solution. The generations raised under television as the pinnacle of marketing are _utterly oblivious_ to this form of silent inflation around them, but their kids notice how futile and wasteful their 'constantly repurchase the same substandard shit' consumer culture has become. And they're doing everything they can not to participate, because being manipulated to buy bullshit resembling historic products that were actually functional sucks.
