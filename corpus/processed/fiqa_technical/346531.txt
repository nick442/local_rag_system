>Amazon is always going to be pointless for screws and nails because you can't ship that economically. You can't do items like lumber, sheet rock, or concrete due to weight. You can never ship large items due to size. Amazon appears to be aggressively buying retailers that have physical presence in many communities. I would not put it past them to begin buying building supply companies that specialize in delivery of bulk building materials.
