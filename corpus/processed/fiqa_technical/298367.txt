i've been waiting for the MOVE to get off its butt for a while now but as long as we stay goldilocks and yellen vacillates between hawkish and dovish its hard for it to climb meaningfully. The MOVE is at 52 now - for some context, the traditional view was that below 70 was complacent, above 100 was panic but since the era of unprecedented central bank intervention that hardly holds.
