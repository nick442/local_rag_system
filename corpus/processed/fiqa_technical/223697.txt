One thing that kept me from doing a budget for years is how complex some people make it. For example you list your gross pay, then deduct the taxes, 401K, FSA, etc.. Why? Those are pretty consistent. For me, the way this is budgeted is I list my net pay, and go from there. If you were perfect in predicting your FSA, you would have no medical expenses on your budget! Simple, easy budget! Now this year, you will probably have to pay out of pocket for some expenses. Can you predict how much? Can your disposable income absorb the overages? If not you will need to start a sinking fund. That is put a sufficient amount of money into a savings account each month to cover the shortage. Keep in mind you can go over a bit on your FSA contributions. If you find yourself near the end of the plan year with extra money, you can also claim mileage reimbursement for your medical appointments. Since your FSA has a history of those, it is easy to calculate your mileage from your home to the DR's office and submit a claim.
