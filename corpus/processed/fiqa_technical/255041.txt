When you register for the exam, the CFA Institute sends you the CFA curriculum (a self-contained set of books and practice problems - it's +2,000 pages per exam). You can have zero knowledge of finance, study the given material, and then pass the exams. This being said, it will help if you begin to develop a passion for financial markets as you learn and try to apply your lessons. Yes, I believe the CFA Charter (or pursuit of it) is a good signal to prospective employers especially if you are trying to make a career switch.
