I agree that college doesn't or shouldn't have to be all about job prep. However, the caveat I will add is that if you go into DEBT for your education, you should certainly be thinking about the economic value your education can provide you. The last point about subsidized college being cheaper than the current system. I don't know. I'd have to see these reports you speak of, and who made them, and for what incentive. At the end of the day though, these findings are all moot unless we can have a conversation about the hyperinflation in college costs directly related to 'free' aka subsidized education.
