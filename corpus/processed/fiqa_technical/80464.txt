A 'bailout' is money from the government to keep open a business that is no longer viable and by rights deserves to fail. What happened in this case was different. All banks rely on the overnight bank lending market for liquidity. It is the grease that oils the wheels of international banking. That is not a sign of weakness or recklessness. It is just standard banking practice. In 2008, during the failure of Bear Stearns and the Lehman Shock the overnight lending market simply stopped operating as nobody knew who they could trust and as a result nobody trusted anybody. Something needed to temporarily replace this overnight lending until the crisis was over. This is what that cash infusion was. It was not a bailout.
