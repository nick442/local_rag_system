It was actually meant to be more of just a joke comment. But it doesn't take very many successful billion dollar lawsuits to justify $10 million a pop. Personally I think that part of the patent reform solution is that patents are non-exclusive; however, licensing must be set up before use including free licensing if the owner wants to public domain it. If the two parties can't agree to terms then it goes to a arbitrator to set the the licensing fees which is binding. The arbitration will take into account the research and development costs required, likelihood of the same thing being independently created, estimated profits from products using the patent, etc. Of course the core issue is granting patents for silly stuff but since the ones already in existence are presumably grandfathered in I think enforcing market driven licensing fees is the best way to prevent all of the dumb lawsuits going on. The patent holder gets its money or maintains market advantage if the licensing fee is so high that no one wants to pay it and it doesn't prevent competition from using other another party's patented ideas.
