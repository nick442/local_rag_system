"All this is completely true, but I was going for a more basic level theoretical. In this case, yes, one person not paying of their loans would not hurt anything (except the person in question as you point out), but if ""people"" not paying of their loans *is* bad as it would rob money from the system (basically $0 of the $30 would come back, or at least so little that the banks stopped loaning). While the government can inject money, that could only go so far. Really, I was just trying to explain why not paying off loans was bad for the economy even though staying in sustainable debt is good for the economy (but not necessarily the individual). Thanks for the info though."
