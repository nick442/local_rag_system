130k in LA? That's not life-changing or anything. Do the usual: save money, buy used cars, cheapest rent you can live with, etc. If it was me, I'd be researching the local housing market. Save cash until you find a deal you like. Work the numbers, do your homework. You're the finance guy - you should know what a good deal looks like.
