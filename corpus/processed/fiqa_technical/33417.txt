Hi guys, could I get advice on possibly entering finance myself? I have a BSE in computer engineering, and a Ph.D. in nanoscience and microsystems, and I do computational aeroscience and biology now. Needless to say, I'm an applied physics and computer nerd. I love currency and commodities trading and instruments, though, I'm totally fascinated by it and I'm a *mean* coder and scientist. Can I get into finance?
