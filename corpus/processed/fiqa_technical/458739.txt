It's really not comparable. I love Wegmans, but it's not the same thing. Wegmans is a nice grocery store. Whole Foods is not a place you go for most groceries - it's a place you go for fresh meats/fish/etc, especially when looking for more unique things, and especially if you're picky about what you're getting. And even if you want to deny all that, Wegmans has a small footprint, so it is irrelevant in most areas.
