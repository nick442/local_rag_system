> decoupling between rise in productivity and rise in wages But that doesn't even pass the logic test, so I don't know why it's routinely hauled out as something that's supposed to be meaningful. If employees are more productive you need less of them. If you need less there is more supply - and demand (i.e. wages) goes down. Add into that people living and working longer and there is less competition for labor in most markets. There was a relationship from 1945 to 1970 - but not because they are intricately linked. Just because that was the benefit of being the world's healthiest economy and superpower following a major war. It was never meant to last.
