I am very interested to see what Market Basket's sales look like in another two months. Consumers tend to do their grocery shopping out of habit, and all a competitor (manufacturer or retailer)needs is one chance to show them a better option. Market Basket has lost many customers for good, but will this story lead to even more new customers?
