Late night comedy is in there, but not much. I read articles on the internet. My investigation has never been on what Trump says he will do. It has been on what everyone has done or is doing. I’m not a rabid Trump hater or supporter, and I’m not a politician, so I’ve felt no compulsion to memorize Trump’s agenda. What I do feel a compulsion for is vetting information and gettingbpeople to work together to create a nation where EVERYONE wins.
