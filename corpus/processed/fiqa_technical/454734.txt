The net benefit to the US economy for the DoD is likely positive thanks to the Navy alone, to be honest. But yah, it shouldn't be about it providing a positive return. I am not a supporter of USPS, though. It's an antiquated system. So much pollution, so much waste, and for what? So that you can get junk mail and businesses can continue to send you paper bills for some reason in 2014? I'd rather they take the $70bn budget of USPS and develop a nationwide wireless internet system (even if it's at Edge network speeds) and we can get rid of the USPS entirely afterwards.
