"This is precisely the problem. Economic contraction scared people. So instead of continuing making promises, they started paying off the promises they had (for fear that something in the future would make it so they couldn't). This resulted in increased economic contraction because it became more difficult to trade money for service (because people basically valued paying off debt more than the service). The biggest issue is that neither position is wrong, yet they don't work well together. People paying off debt is fine so long as there is sill money for services, and people paying for service is fine so long as they don't rack up more debt than they can pay. Really, it's the transitions that always get us. Further, these transitions are constantly repeated, which is why the economic data so often displays ""patterns""."
