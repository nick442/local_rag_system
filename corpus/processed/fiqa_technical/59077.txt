She was literally the person responsible for Google's home page. She built the entire PM org at Google. She had years of management experience. If you look at her resume she was an engineer for 2 years and a manager for 11 before moving to Yahoo. The difference is, when you have all the right people and are already on the right path (Google), it's an incredibly different proposition than a company that's already declining with a bunch of people that have been at that company for 10+ years. There's a massive amount of institutional inertia. Her vision for the company wasn't horrible, but her entire leadership style and handling of the company she was put in charge of was completely tone deaf. She also wasted a massive amount of money on pointless gambles that the company never capitalized on.
