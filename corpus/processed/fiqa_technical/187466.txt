"He knows maintenance, and presumably he knows which cars are notorious for breaking down. I can only imagine three scenarios for ending up with your broken car: * SAABs break if you don't maintain them normally/properly - your husband knows better than to neglect this. * SAABs break no matter how well you maintain them - your husband knows better than to buy an old used car that is guaranteed to fail. * Your SAAB is a fluke, of unusually poor quality, or was in an accident - in which case I don't understand why you used it as an example to illustrate that ""SAABs are notorious for electrical problems"". That makes me curious. Which one is wrong? Or am I missing something - am I wrong?"
