>Perhaps you are confusing Costco with Sam's club? Nope. And I have no need to correct this problem. Means nothing to me. And I'm not really the type to stick my nose into other people's business. If they need to know, they can ask. In either case, I'm still a loyal customer. Additionally, it's very hard to find good help where I live. Too many jobs, not enough people. I know how much some of these business struggle to find and keep people.
