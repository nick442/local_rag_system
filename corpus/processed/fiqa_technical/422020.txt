Just clarifying in case some people just skim and walk away thinking the author is bankrupt. Kiyosaki is involved in many business ventures. One of his companies filed for bankruptcy, which is a separate entity to himself. He himself did not lose any personal assets and is still very rich. Thanks for reading.
