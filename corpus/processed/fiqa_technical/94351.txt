Sure, sure, as long as we shift over to a socialist or post-scarcity economy first. While I have to compete with the arbitrarily-enhanced for jobs, fuck no I'm not letting them go forward. Note: I'm in favor of transhumanism, in favor of the Singularity, in favor of post-scarcity economies. I'm *not* in favor of capitalism, which makes human progress into a danger to be contained.
