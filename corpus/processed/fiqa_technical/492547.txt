How so? And yes this is a safety critical system. It was on a switch statement and the problem was with (not)/taking the correct case, not that the input to the switch was wrong, but going to case 2 instead of case 4 given an input of 4. If you are not going to trust the compiler/cpu you may as well give up because at that point there is a semi infinite number of test cases that you'd have to perform. It's unreasonable in that it shows lack of understanding of the problem.
