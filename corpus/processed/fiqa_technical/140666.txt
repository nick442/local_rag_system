"Can someone comment on the quality of zerohedge.com? When i saw that the front page articles were created by a user ""Tyler durden"" with the fight club avatar, and one of the articles being ""top 10 things that America predicted"" it really makes me question the legitimacy of the website as a serious source. Hope someone can share thier opinion!"
