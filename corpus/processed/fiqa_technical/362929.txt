Word! I don't watch TV any more. If I wan't to watch a certain show I stream it online. Surely it should be obvious that the concept of sitting down in front of a TV at some time to watch a show, because someone at a TV station decided that this show should be broadcast at that certain time is outdated and unnecessary. On demand is the future (and present). Long live progress!
