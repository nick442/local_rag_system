Agreed across the board. We'll start seeing a rash of patents and patent enforcement cases on various spare parts that have been high-margin cash cows for various companies. We'll also see trademark infringement cases for things like replacing the hood ornament on your Jaguar or the logo emblem on the back of your car. And I also agree that just like VCRs, digital downloads, etc - it won't work.
