"The dirty secret of finance is that a lot of front office work is also boring. Get used to it. The moments when money pours magically from the phone and gushes unstoppably from your Bloomberg are brief and fleeting, and are punctuated by long months when you do little but scrub data, build models and systems, foster client relationships with people you don't especially like, and spend god-knows-how-long in mind-numbing internal meetings. You want to stab yourself now? Just wait. ""My department generates nothing because it's all compliance."" <- Don't be this guy, it's not a commendable or mature attitude. Compliance and back office are not sexy areas, but without them guess what? Your trades won't settle and you'll end up in prison. They frequently work longer hours than front office, always get paid less than front office, and they've been told by better guys than you that they are nothing but a cost base. They also have long memories and a vindictive sense of retribution, especially for condescending front office twats who look down on them.."
