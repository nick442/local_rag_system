try to set your patriotism aside for a second and think about the situation they put people in. it's terrible. you build friendships for 6 years, and that is actually a pretty long time, then they just deport you. how would you feel about that? it sucks. that's why H1b is crap. you might get payed better and maybe you like America better than your own country but after 6 years it's over, for most the dream ends after the time is up.
