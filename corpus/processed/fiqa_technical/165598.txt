JPM is probably the hugest too big to fail alongside being one of the most highly leveraged. Did you see Jamie Dimon testifying before our great politicians earlier this year? I mean if the Federal Government is kissing his ass, what will the State of New York really accomplish? The Bear Stearns collapse was avoided by JPM jumping in and saving the pride of Wall Street. Do you see Barclay's getting sued for things Lehman Brothers did? Barclay's is living the good life in London rigging LIBOR, while JPM, an American institution is being re-regulated. Should the government sue every company that goes out of business for defrauding customers, employees, and all stakeholders? SMH
