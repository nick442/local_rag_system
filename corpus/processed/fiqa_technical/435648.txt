That's my unpopular opinion about restaurants, too. I don't think that customers should be paying the bulk of wages of servers through tips. I worked in food service for years and my immediate family all still does. I'm aware that restaurant margins are often razor thin. Raise prices, pay your workers, if people don't want your food at those prices anymore, close. Maybe it's a sign that we have too many restaurants if they can't compete without subsidized wages for their staff.
