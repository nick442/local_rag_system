"While some taxi services have developed an app, taxis don't compete on price or coverage, to be honest. For a very long time, in a lot of places, taxis have had a protected monopoly, leading to just fucknig terrible service and insane prices. As an example, about a year ago I took the train up to Seattle. On my trip home, I arrived on a weekday around 2p. Middle of the day, nothing going on. I called the local taxi service to pick me up and go maybe 3 miles. I waited 45 minutes, finally called the dispatch and they said, ""Oh, it'll be another half hour."" I said never mind, called an uber, and was home in about 15 minutes."
