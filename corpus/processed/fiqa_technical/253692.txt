I've done it in smaller forms (I'm not OP) in video games. Particularly a video game called Call of Duty: Black Ops. There's a zombie mode in this game. Each time you shoot a zombie, you get 10 points pet bullet, 30 points per headshot. The zombies come in levels, with level 1 having 10 zombies. And each new level having more zombies. The kicker: with each new level, the zombies get stronger, and take more bullets to kill. Level 1, everyone starts with a handgun; this handgun becomes useless in later levels and you're required to buy better weapons with better firepower and more bullets. It's competitive while also being co-operative, like capitalism. There have been plenty of games where I let other players do the work for the first 10 levels. Almost all of those times, I end up never getting to their level and I'm always dying. (If you die, you don't respawn until the next round AND you lose some of your points, which means less bucks to get a better weapon). This creates a system where the rich get richer, and those that start late, never catch up. No matter how hard I work, what strategy I try, I never catch up to the levels of fiscal wealth that the other players do. And this is me actually knowing how to play and game the system (which usually involves not-spending points early in-game, and upgrading only in intervals according to level-needs and saving up for when you die). If I had more time and patience, it would make a great documentation.
