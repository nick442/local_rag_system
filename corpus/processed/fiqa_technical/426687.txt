Very true but that's not the point of my post or at all how it relates to this article. I even said that My point though is how the felon thing affects the economy in comparison to the 1980s or even 90s. Factorys in many places are begging for help at the moment. But nowadays there is no 2nd chances and factorys aren't giving it, one felony and youre done for life. Even if you somehow get it expunged. There's millions and millions of potheads and felons and always will be. 20 years ago those people could easily find jobs when now they cannot. Factor in that Mexicans who likely do a much better job are taking the under the table jobs. I don't think there's much we can do about it but it absolutely affects the economy and society, it's certainly something people should be looking at.
