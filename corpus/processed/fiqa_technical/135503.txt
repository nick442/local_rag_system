Seriously, what he said. Learn HTML / CSS / php / MySQL and you can earn 100k/yr with ease. I've seen people learn it on their own within a year or less. As long as you're diligent and have a passion for building something awesome out of nothing you will learn slowly but surely. Even beginner programmers can make 60k a year without trying.
