It's not just that they are not spending; there is too much capital concentrated on the top of the high net worth set to find anyone to invest. All the investment in the world can't do anything but create supply. Supply is worthless without demand. Without a consumer base with disposable income, there is not enough demand to create anything other than lackluster growth. Supply side economics continues to exacerbate income inequality, crippling demand and thereby limiting investment opportunity. Thus, the richest have nowhere to put their mountains of capital, so it sits in govt bonds, holding rates down, or goes into various other value stores. It's not being invested or spent, but it is being removed from activity, and it certainly is not trickling down into the millions suffering under increasing prices and stagnant wages. As wealth inequality grows, the entire economy suffers. The other detrimental effect of this is the creation of market bubbles to feed the appetite of this capital glut for better returns. Bubbles aren't growth or healthy investment; they are widespread economic disasters in the making. Redistribution of wealth, however accomplished, is the only solution to this problem. This is not a moral question. It's economics and math.
