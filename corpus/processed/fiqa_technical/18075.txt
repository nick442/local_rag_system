Well the product is the Snoppa M1 gimble which had a successful indiegogo campaign a while back. www.snoppa.com/mone.html (product page) I don't want to share to much on the pricing, but I have a lot of room with pricing as I'm friends with the founder here in China. As for customer support and guarantee they cover everything with a 12 month warranty, and will be offering customer service/support directly. So it isn't something I need to be to concerned with.
