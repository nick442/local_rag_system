"i'm having a hard time understanding the argument you're making here. i think you're saying: ""if an employer is having a hard time filling positions, they don't have to raise wages because the government says the minimum wage is only 'this little.'"" if that's really what you're saying, it doesn't make any sense. what does a minimum wage have to do with not being able to fill positions because you don't pay enough? if that's not what you're saying, could you please clarify?"
