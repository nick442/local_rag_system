Very interesting read but I feel like the BitCoin stocks are just a bit too volatile to place your future security and livelihood in them. To those who are thinking about going this route, I would strongly suggest you hedge your bets with a more stable entity in addition to the BitCoin stock. Then again, we all know the risks of placing money in the stockmarket. It's unpredictable and risky, the higher the risk the higher the reward, but that's just my two cents. May feel like a contradiction to some based on what I've said previously, but I actually love what BitCoin are doing.
