Still pretty difficult.. I have a computer science degree which is highly sought after and took a 37k$ job out of school. Most job postings I can apply to now are 60-75k$. Senior developers get paid 90-120k$ unless you suddenly become famous and people in SF want to hire you for 250k$ My bf graduated as a civil engineer and he would start at 55k$ and maybe make 90k$ with experience, but this profession tends to be ripe with 60-80 hour weeks too. So much for degrees. A lot of it is selling yourself a ton and basically becoming your own sales person. It isn't easy at all, even with degrees.
