As far as I knew a similar law was already on the books, something about the commercial can be no louder than the volume of the show before it, so the show would run at say 75% of normal output volume (thus why your systems/dvd players always seem louder, they're just not cut) then they would run one loud explosion or word, scene, etc, but short enough that you wouldn't turn it down, then the commercials could be super loud.
