"We do vote for the good of our community. That is why the vast area of the country was painted red after the outcome of the elections. We live in the country because we don't want the social or governmental problems cities have. We own our land, pay taxes on our land and we will be damned to have people tell us what we can or can't do with our land. From where I sit, I see a lot of urban people wish they could live in the country, but most simply can't, they are wage earners. Many ""city slickers"" have bought a farm only to lose their ass and farm a few years later, they learn the hard way that experience trumps education. So let me ask you, what can you do? Build a barn or house, weld, fabricate your own parts, lite to medium vet work, grow food, run heavy equipment, plumb, wire electricity?"
