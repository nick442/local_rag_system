When I invest in a business valued at $50,000, I pay $25,000 and receive 50% equity. Does that $25,000 go to the current owner of the business, or into the capital of the business itself? Who receives the money depends on who is selling you the equity. There are a couple of different scenarios that can fit your question. You could buy existing shares from the current owner(s) of the company. In this case, the current owner(s) would be receiving the funds from you, and in return giving you their stake in the company. So if you all agree that the value of the business is $50,000, and you give $25,000 to the current owner(s), they give you half of their shares. The value of the company has not changed. The company could be issuing new shares. This is called stock dilution, or an increase in authorized share capital. Let's say that everyone agrees that the value of the business is $50,000. The company could create new shares and sell them to you for $25,000. In this case, the value of the company has jumped to $75,000; you now control one-third of the company, and the existing owner(s), who previously owned 100% of the company, now only own two-thirds. In order for you to end up with 50% of the company in this case, you would have to invest $50,000 instead, which would result in the company being valued at $100,000. If you are wondering why the current owners would agree to this second scenario, there are two questions that address this:
