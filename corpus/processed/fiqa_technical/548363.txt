Firstly, comparing debt to GDP is comparing a stock to a flow, you're committing a transgression that is warned about in Econ 101. Secondly, I appreciate your concern about the height of debt but it's really just a measure of the flow of capital. Debt is an investment too, and the headline debt number mixes government, corporate, and consumer debt which have very different attributes. In fact the holders of most government debt are normal citizens and pensioners. More concerning might be the levels of *consumer* debt, but (I would argue) that only becomes an issue if debt starts being issued fraudulently to people who shouldn't be receiving it, e.g. ahead of the mortgage crisis. There may be nothing I can say to convince you otherwise, and I'm not saying that overleveraging *isn't* something to be concerned about, but I'm trying to remind you that the story is more complicated than you're letting on. Finally, respectfully, please don't scaremonger about derivatives. The notional value is very high, but derivatives are a zero-sum market (unlike the stock market, e.g.), and in fact the majority of derivatives are for hedging and reducing risk. While it's certainly possible to use derivatives to leverage oneself, this really only happens with hedge fund-type operations, and even if the derivative market blew up I highly doubt it would affect average people very much. TL;DR, If there's another crash in the next 5 years, I doubt it will be due to debt (outside of *perhaps* China, but I think that'd lead to more of a recession than a full blown 2008-esque crisis). It definitely will not be because of derivatives.
