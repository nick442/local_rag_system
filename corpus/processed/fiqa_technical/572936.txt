"Hi all, confused about how employee option pools interact with pre-money and post-money VC valuations. From what I understand, the pool essentially dilutes pre-money valuation. A quote from [FastIgnite](http://fastignite.com/startup-tools/calculating-true-pre-money-valuation): > Say the VC wants 20%. If the company is valued at $10M then the VC would put in $2.5M for a post money of $12.5M ($2.5M / $12.5M = 20%). However, if a 30% option pool is added then the post money will be $20M (the pool will be $6M) and the VC will put in $4M ($1.5M or 60% more than before). The pre-money would have jumped to $16M. I get that in both cases, the founder stays at a $10.0m ""true"" valuation, and a pool dilutes founder pre-money ownership from 100.0% to 62.5% in this case. But, it seems like the pool is adding value out of nowhere! The only additional money is coming from the VC, but somehow the pool is worth $6m?"
