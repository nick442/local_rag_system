"There are some euphemisms that are better known than others. A category of stocks that's suitable for ""widows and orphans"" would be stocks that are low beta, and perhaps high dividend. Safe (being relative) enough to put a window's money into. The term ""cake and underwear"" appears to me to be a Buffetism. And I'd interpret it to mean,""not tech, not stocks that are either high growth or cyclic, but stocks that make things that have steady demand and that most consumers use."" Google the phrase, only Buffet comes up."
