We rarely do them where they go beyond 100m one way. When we do we get a single charge in the middle and go 300m. If we were going any further then a few more stops don't bother me..especially with noisy kids. There was one time we picked up a 1-day rental for $20 to go into the mountains where there were no chargers (and dirty bumpy etc). Good thing, popped a tire on the rental :). For the extremely adventurous maybe you want something else. For most others it works out really well.
