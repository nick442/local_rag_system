travel industry professional here - the selection of hotels/holidays you show people when they do a search is crucial (in my experience the single most powerful tool at your disposal). the best websites take as many factors into account that they can and offer a different mix depending on the type of searcher. Showing more upmarket product is very lucrative in the right circumstances, and often has a better conversion rate. This Orbitz stuff makes complete sense.
