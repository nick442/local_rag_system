Of course, 100k a year is middle to upper middle in almost every location except the global hubs of America (la, San Fran, new york, etc etc). I know where i live a family making 100k is just 227$ away from upper class (according to Washington posts calculator). Hell growing up my mother made 38k and she was able to afford a 150k house, yearly vacation trips abroad, and a new car paid off in 1 year. By all means of the article that is the aspirations Joe Biden quoted. The only difference is we live in the midwest. I think no one living in California, New York city, miami, etc. should get delusional and believe that our most demanded locations will have room for everyone, especially at a reasonable rate. People are willing to spend 5k for a studio in New York because it is a city of opportunity, San Francisco is not a place to let life come to you. What i love about the Midwest is that living is incredibly cheap, and if you have established yourself soon enough there is a fortune to be made, especially in real estate. Not to mention we have Chicago, Detroit, Cedar Point which almost every family is close enough and earns enough to visit at least once a year. We may not have enough to afford Lamborghini's, multi million dollar houses, or to visit paris on a whim but I feel most in the midwest have enough to love comfortably and save for retirement atleast (minus maybe the bible belt)
