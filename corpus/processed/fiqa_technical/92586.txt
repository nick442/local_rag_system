I, for one, am very surprised that Tesla doesn't have a warranty exception for high mileage commercial use. Tesloop's cars rack up over 75000 miles per year at the low end. Sure, the data collected is valuable for product durability testing and Autopilot mapping right now, but there has to be a limit somewhere.
