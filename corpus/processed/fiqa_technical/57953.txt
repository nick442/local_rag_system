"> Wii – 95.85 million as of 31 March 2012[8] > Xbox 360 – 65.8 million as of 12 January 2012[52] > PlayStation 3 – 63.9 million as of 31 March 2012[53] I wouldn't characterize those numbers as Microsoft ""dominating"" the market. I also don't think it is a ""certainty"" that Microsoft will dominate the next generation. >MS is also much closer to a unified platform for you TV. I don't get this at all. I have a 360 and a PS3. My PS3, has Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, and it's own video service but it also has a blue ray player and the ability to easily stream videos from my Windows Home server, something I've been unable to get my 360 to do. Personally, I think Windows 8 is going to be very similar to Vista. Businesses (which is a HUGE % of Microsoft's OS market) aren't going to touch Windows 8 with a 10 foot pole. Keep in mind Windows XP is still 41% of the PC market. Overall, you've got a much rosier view of Microsoft than I do."
