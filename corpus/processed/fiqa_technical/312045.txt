">more foreign capital would flow in More capital flowing in to a country that defaults on its payments? Hah, that's a good one! Brazil defaulted in the 1980s, the result was a lost decade of high unemployment and hyperinflation reaching upwards of 80% **per month**. Same with Argentina, only their hyperinflation was above 200% per month. There's nothing positive coming from breaking up with the world's monetary system, any positive results that you get could be obtained with much less suffering by doing whatever austerity measures you need in order to honor your debts. I'm Brazilian and had to go through that situation just as I was starting to work. Ironically, the labour party is now in power here and Brazil is now a net creditor internationally. AFTER the ""evil capitalists"" took power and privatized the state corporations the situation started to improve, and the labour party finally managed to be elected and now are reaping the fruits of all that they fought so hard against. I remember their slogans in the 1989 election campaign: ""the external debt is immoral and unpayable"", ""no to privatization""."
