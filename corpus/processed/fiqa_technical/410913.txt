"Technical people on Reddit who have dealt with Oracle or similar web sites & systems (myself included) seem to believe that Oregon's claims come down to whether it was Oracle or the state government who was worse at planning the creation and maintenance of Oregon's healthcare web site. I tend to think that government entities are often worse at managing & planning things, and therefore believe that Oracle would be less likely to blame, but this doesn't necessarily mean that all of the more than dozen claims for damages will all be thrown out either. One key claim is that Oracle asserted that ~95% of the web site's functionality would work ""out of the box"", thus leaving only 5% of the web site's functionality requiring third party (potentially custom) integration. The burden is on Oregon to prove that the failures of the web site were the result of more than that 5%, and that Oracle was contractually obligated to fix issues with the "">5%"" at no additional charge. Failure to prove that would result in Oracle being justified in asking for more $ to fix the web site, such that the alleged racketeering and much of the fraud did not actually take place."
