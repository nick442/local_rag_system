In the very unlikely event that it is not a scam, there would be a distinct probability that it is someone trying to launder money. You don't want to get caught up with drug dealers or ISIS terrorists, so forget it. There is also the possibility that your post is a scam, looking for people who would believe such nonsense. I wonder if people who reply are going to get phished.
