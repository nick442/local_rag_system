Hey. Currently in treasury. It's good in some ways and bad in others. Every role has it's pluses and minuses. Some basic thoughts are that you get to see a lot of the company. You get a cursory view of what everyone is doing, all the time, but you don't really ever get in depth views of any one area. It's a role that makes it easy to jump around industries because every large company has a treasury department, but it limits the size of the company you can join because a lot of small companies won't have one or will just have a cash person and not an actual department. You get to look at bond and commercial paper markets, if that's interesting to you. You get a lot of interaction with higher ups because cash is hugely important. You're the first to know if the company is gonna go bankrupt. It's a good place to learn the business if you end up wanting to move, but it's a pretty specific skill set and carries a decent amount of responsibility. It's one of the only corporate finance roles that's closer to front office than mid or back office. If you are just joining corporate treasury, you'll probably start out doing cash management and forecasting, maybe doing short term liquidity and investment activity. After that, you would move into bond stuff, pensions/401k management, corporate finance stuff as opposed to the cash desk. After that, you'd probably get to be involved in stuff like long term planning and M&A activity, which is the real cool shit. That's what came off the top of my head. Do you have any specific questions?
