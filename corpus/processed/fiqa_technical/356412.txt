Considering that North Korea fired a [missile OVER fucking Japan](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/28/world/asia/north-korea-missile.html?mcubz=3) One has to wonder what and why and where are the missile shields etc, because so far they only seem to intercept friendly test missiles, this would have been a real good opportunity to show that it works. But that heartening news aside he wants to hurt the South Koreans economically? Is PePe le Pew confused as to who our allies are, because it seems he is intentionally breaking off . .perhaps insulating the world against the comming US default?
