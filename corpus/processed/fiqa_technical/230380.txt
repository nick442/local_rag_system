"Do you think that your bank has a separate vault for just your money? Of course not. The bank just has one big pot of money that everything gets dumped into. They know exactly how much money each person is supposed to have. The problem is when they add up all the money in the vault.. well lets just say a lot of it is missing. That's why they are supposed to have two vaults, one with the customer's money and one with the investor's money. But since all the account tracking is done internally it becomes real easy to ""borrow"" from one vault to fund the other. Vault: MF Global's at another bank"
