Agreed. In his current situation, I'd expect OP would find the most personally fulfilling use of his freedom to be spending his time (and not his money) helping people that he is able to help. He mentioned he was a cop. Maybe he'd have the insight needed to help get kids out of gangs. Or, help improve relationships between cops and rough neighborhoods. Doesn't have to be a cop thing. That's just all I've got to work with.
