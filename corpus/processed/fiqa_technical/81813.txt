"> whether it's better to drop out of Harvard or graduate from Brown. Lol, I'm sure the difference is negligible between those two. What he intended to say is ""whether it's better to drop out of harvard, or graduate with honors from a HBCU"". I also encourage anyone that's been to a real university to audit, or shit, even spend a day hanging around, an HBCU and then argue with me me that ""we're all equal"". You think real unis coddle these mental midgets? Wait until you see an institution designed around it."
