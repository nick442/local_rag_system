"The answer is stimulus, but more specifically direct spending. The kind of ""stimulus"" where we simply fill in giant gaping holes of bank balance sheets is not ""stimulus"" at all, and those who criticize ""keynesian economics"" because the bailouts ""failed"" don't understand what they are saying. Bailouts are not stimulus. Creating middle class jobs, that is stimulus. I will put it to you this way. Almost every single company in existence uses some kind of debt to leverage its operations. Almost every company that is listed on the stock exchange either sells bonds or issues commercial paper or both. This can also be a useful position for the government, especially since their cost of borrowing is lower than that of any company. Essentially, the government can borrow at 1%, put people to work, and collect 25% in taxes. Its cash flow positive in the short term, and in the long term as well, as long as it is effective and the economy gets better. A growing economy will bring in more than enough tax revenue to offset any costs of jump starting the economy. If instead you wanted austerity, you would be calling for austerity on the largest economy in the world, who's bonds are still rated AAA, and who's borrowing costs are 1%. If you are calling for austerity on that, then nobody on earth is credit worthy. It is a non-sensical position."
