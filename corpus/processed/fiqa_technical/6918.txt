">If there aren't enough seats in the classrooms, some people will be left without the college education they want, no matter how the financing is provided. I'll grant you this, but we can always produce more classrooms. Let's use your loan example. If I take out a college loan it represents the value of some other asset, and the lender's belief that I will later be able to compensate the lender for giving up that asset. Just as we could price the value of the hunter's demise, we can price the value of a student's failure or success. If the student has delivered in the past (good grades, high productivity), then we can reliably price the cost of her college education. In a very real way, she has ""created"" her own seat in the classroom right now by promising to pay for it in the future. And we can rely on this promise on the basis of her past performance. I won't get into whether this is reliable or even desirable. Just as we priced the value of the hunter's non-performance/demise, we can price the student's non-performance/default. We can build this into the cost of the loan, or spread the cost out among all the other loans we give."
