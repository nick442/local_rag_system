Hey, sorry man, I didn't mean to come off as so argumentative. This is clearly an issue that rustles a lot of jimmies. Thanks for the article, I'll read it over. I used to work in HFT and the people I worked with were some of the brightest people I know and the work was extremely fulfilling, so I have a bit of an emotional soft spot for it that can cloud my debate skills. It's clearly not as one sided as I believe but I encourage you to keep learning as I am. *Dark Pools* by Scott Paterson is another book that while it leans towards Michael Lewis' position, I found it to be a much more historically accurate account based on what I've learned from people in industry, you should check it out!
