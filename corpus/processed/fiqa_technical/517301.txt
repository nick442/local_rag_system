I have been torn on college in it's entirety for the last couple of years. When you consider how many successful business men and women, who never finished college, the stories of experience beating out education in hiring, and the amount of debt stress you carry for basically your entire life.. I am just not sure people should even bother at this point. My girlfriend right now has sooo much debt it weighs on her constantly. I had never seen the weight of that debt on someone so personally until recently.
