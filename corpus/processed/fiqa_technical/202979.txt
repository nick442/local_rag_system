I wish.. the Red Robin here and you'll have the waitress, an assistant manager, and a manager all ask you how everything is two or 3 times a meal, often in rapid succession.. like literally 1 minute apart. Leave me the fuck alone! All I need is the waitress to covertly keep an eye on the level of my drink, and maybe a quick check 2 minutes after delivering the food to make sure everything is as it should be. I don't need to be asked if everything's ok 9 times a meal.
