Meh, that's good for pain if that works, but that's a relatively small market compared to pharmaceuticals from a business perspective, much lower profit margins because anyone can grow it. It's a highly competitive field, and as soon as it becomes legal federally you know that Altria and other huge corporations are going to be able to sell it and put the small producers out of business. Many great minds also never did drugs. Again, I'm just going by my experiences, and none of the smart/successful people at my company or in my group of friends smoke pot.
