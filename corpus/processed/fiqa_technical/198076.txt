100% of their pork is antibiotic-free. They can't get all their beef or chicken up to those standards yet, but the meat that they do get that's antibiotic-free is just that.. the animals were never given antibiotics. Mostly I'm posting because people seemed incredulous that livestock could be truly never treated with antibiotics, but *all* organic meat is supposed to meet those standards, so it's not far-fetched. When Chipotle says antibiotic-free, they either mean it meets the USDA organic standards, or they're lying.
