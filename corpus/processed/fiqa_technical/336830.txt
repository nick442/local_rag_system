"> Check the ""maybe""(s): they are all yours! [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/6sb4qh/for_the_last_time_trump_hasnt_made_the_economy/dlk1hax/) is where you first used ""maybe"" to talk about President's Trump's possible position on Medicare drug negotiation. [The post right after](https://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/6sb4qh/for_the_last_time_trump_hasnt_made_the_economy/dlk99em/) I point out your ""maybe"" statement is only one of an infinte number of maybes so none of them have value. Ever since you have claimed that judging President Trump on what he may be doing was my position. It never was. > How ""instability"" will happen because it's tiny bit hotter? I gave you [a link](https://www.americansecurityproject.org/climate-security/) when I said global warming is a serious risk to the country. It gives possible scenarios. > I asked you, again, and again, and again, and again, to give me one ACTION by Trump that you oppose. [Here is your first request for an example](https://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/6sb4qh/for_the_last_time_trump_hasnt_made_the_economy/dlflgm7/): *Tell me of something that Trump did that you do agree to or do not like.* [Here is the second request to which I responded](https://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/6sb4qh/for_the_last_time_trump_hasnt_made_the_economy/dlgw0h6/): *Please find me something significant that Trump did that you don't like.* Neither one asked for an ""action"". > He's a liar, so you won't believe anything he said, anything he does or anything I say about him. No, it only means I won't accept what he says as true. > Hillary and the DNC are not liars. So you voted for them. > Hillary with her handling of e-mail(s), cheating on debate questions, rigging elections against Sanders.. > Hillary is not with her ""deplorables"" remarks, seeking presidency despite all the scandals and cheating, her ""I should be 50 points ahead"" And, once again, your defense for President Trump is complaining about the Democrats. I think you do this because you secretly know my categories of reasons I do not support our president have validity. > Darling, already since July the whole media, even Fox, are trying to show the Trump lied, unpresidential, etc. And so far? Anything? Sure, [here is a list of some of the lies](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/06/23/opinion/trumps-lies.html). (I am sure you'll complain about ""fake news"" even though every lie is sourced and you can look them up for yourself.) > YOU ARE, how can I say plainly, despite wanting a non-liar, presidential, etc president, you voted for Hillary and the DNC, who are the EPITOMY of liars, cheaters, narcissists, unreliable, criminals, untrustworthy. Do you see how your tribalism make you ridiculous? I never said who I voted for and I never expressed support for Hillary or the DNC but here you are in bold print telling me I am ridiculous for being on their side. Look in the mirror if you want to see tribalism."
