I think it is very important to look at this quarter in terms of chief executive turnover from Immelt to Flannery. This is still Immelt's GE and it is in Flannery's interest to completely shit the bed, so that he can show huge immediate improvement as he takes ownership over P&L. It will help him build credibility both with his employees but also Wall St. Rather than fight to shift earnings into the present, it is just as easy to push earnings forward. He also gets the benefit of having lower expectations.
