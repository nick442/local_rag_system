Boston has tons of space in the metropolitan area. Boston is tiny in land size, but you have tons of good towns and areas within 15 miles of the city where you could put a huge campus. You already have Raytheon scattered throughout the greater Boston area with multiple large campuses. They could build from the ground up and also have loads of commercial real estate place they could rent as needed.
