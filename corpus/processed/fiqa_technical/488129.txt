"Non-economist: ""This one irrational thing happened! How can you say market are rational?"" Economist: ""This one irrational thing happened. Perhaps markets are slightly less rational than previously thought. Or perhaps it's noise in the expected amount of irrationality. I wonder how my index funds are doing."" Not saying markets are rational, but you need more than that. If you work in finance, weak efficiency is likely why your job is socially useful. Unless it isn't."
