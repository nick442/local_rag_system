>For instance in far upstate New York its probably cheaper to truck gas from a refinery outside of Montreal than from a refinery outside of New York City or Boston. Oddly enough, there aren't any refineries outside Boston. There aren't any in Massachusetts at all. In fact, there are also none in New York, New Hampshire, Vermont, Maine, Connecticut, or Rhode Island. There are two refineries near New York City, but they're in New Jersey.
