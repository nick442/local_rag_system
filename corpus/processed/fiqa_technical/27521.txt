"Is this sarcasm? But remove the word ""all"" and ""only"" and there's some truth to your statement. Also worth noting - I heard on the a16z podcast that when Henry Ford introduced the assembly line, he doubled the wages of his workers. This is often attributed to him being a super nice guy, or something like that, but apparently he was responding to very high attrition rates. His workers were less happy being slotted into specific tasks so he had to pay them more. Anyway, I think it should be acknowledged that technological advances can increase both financial and psychological inequality."
