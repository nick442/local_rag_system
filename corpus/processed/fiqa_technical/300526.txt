Why do you think there's a lack of people pursuing entrepreneurial opportunities then? Assuming these are economically rational people who want to maximize their personal payoffs, what's holding them back? I apologize for my previous biased assumption that there would be a lack of food. And obviously since they have food they have water to grow it.
