A lot of these comments are right but I'll add two: buybacks and lowering costs. Too many companies have generated hordes of cash over the years; some of it is entirely their fault, cash that wasn't used for r&d (e.g. AAPL) and others simply don't have an opportunity to grow at their stage in the cooperate life cycle within their industry, so all that excess cash that has been generated for years is used for buybacks. Tech is making shit far more efficient and some companies have blotted cost structures, so introduce tech that makes the firm more efficient where applicable and cut unneeded employees.
