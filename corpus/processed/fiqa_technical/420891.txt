"A ""covered put"" of the form of being short, and buying at the strike price if the ""put .. is put"" (excercise), is off the table simply because you can't do shorts in the retirement account. Even if you feel you ""win"" the argument that you're hedged by being short, any broker can say, ""we simply forbid shorts"" and that's that. A ""covered put"" of the form of posting the cash, and spending it to buy at the strike price if the ""put .. is put"" (excercise), might be forbidden by brokerages because, frankly, how do you account for the ""dedicated"" cash? Is it locked down like margin is, or escrow, or what? I don't know offhand how I would address that in my very own firm. Thus, any broker could say, ""we forbid it"" and that's that. The other answers are very interesting in conjunction with this. JoeTaxpayer says, very paraphrased, 'just cuz it's legal doesn't mean we have to offer it.' Jaydles says (again, completely paraphrasing), 'complex stuff for a safe little retirement savings account;' 'difficult to administer' (as I said, how do you account for it); and 'tradition' So maybe look at Scott, per Thorn's answer, LOL. It appears that you can shop around on this issue."
