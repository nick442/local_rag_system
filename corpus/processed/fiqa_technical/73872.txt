Gonna take more than seasonality to break current momentum. Sentiment is not overly bullish from a retail or institutional aspect. If the year ended today this year would have the smallest drop on record (<3%). The short run outlook of 3-6 months looks very positive from this perspective assuming no unforeseen catalyst occurs to break this trend. Longer term, were in for a correction..but that's normal and nobody knows when it will happen. Anyone investing in stocks should know this and if they don't they need a new advisor or should not be investing alone. Buy the fucking dip and diversify your shit.
