Yeah the percentage thing I was a bit unsure of and that totally makes sense. It is a fairly popular place and I would show you more about the company, but I want to stay on the safe side and not broadcast where it is, just in case someone would want to steal this opportunity from me, but anyways.. This company literally has no marketing or advertising and I feel like I could literally double their business with just a good amount of time marketing/advertising. I threw in the percentage idea because I know what I am capable of doing and how much money I could bring to the business. My strategy is to get a good, but fair cut of this deal. Also to give you a idea how bad it is: - No Facebook feed for 1 year - No website modification for 2.5 years - No other social media accounts - A 75,000 email list that has not been engaged in 13 months and so much more..
