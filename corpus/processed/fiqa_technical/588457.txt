I appreciate your answering my questions instead of just downvoting. I'm kinda losing respect for this sub by the minute. I didn't imagine the government commandeering private fleets, rather there being rules in place for those corporations to handle evacuation situations. I do see the potential complexity inherent in that endeavor, but it's by no means too complicated to carry out.
