There are a few scenarios I see possible: 1. Risk parameters in the algo were set very conservatively. Putting quotes out and canceling them is very common. 2. It was looking to exploit situations where someone rips through the book with a market order. 3. It was reacting too slowly to signals, and chasing opportunities that had already passed. Other comments: What do you believe front running is? Your version differs from the textbook definition. Quote taxes are more effective than minimum order durations. I wrote about how that works in a previous post in this thread.
