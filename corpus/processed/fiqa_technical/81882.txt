Comments. The problem is they don't get downvoted though. They play to the crowd of reddit and every discussion ends up anti capitalism and anti trump These views are fine, but its nice to have one sub with mature discussion. I'm not some big Trump fan, I'm not even American, its just nice to have a place where actual business can be discussed. Like I said, if you don't like these rules there are hundreds of other subs. I think these rules work well because it keeps it a business sub and not just the same mess as the rest of reddit.
