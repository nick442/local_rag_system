How is relying on the benevolence of one rich guy a better system than a strong reliable central bank? What if J.P. Morgan decided not not to intervene in 1907, or bail out the gold standard in 1893. Banks will make stupid decisions whether there is a central bank or not. I would argue an organization dedicated to mitigating a crisis is a better option than some guys who may or may not help.
