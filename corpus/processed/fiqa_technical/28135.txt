This conclusion is highly misleading. Although they lead with the 90% figure, I cannot for the life of me see it substantiated in the data. According to their own information (which by the way surveyed preferences, not actual purchases) the actual number is between 55% and 80%. Only by including every item that you saw first in store, tried out at a store, bought at a store, or returned to a store can you get to the 90% figure. They aren't talking purchases at all. Personally I go out shopping all the time and see something cool - and put it back on the shelf because I know that it is cheaper on Amazon. Somehow this study uses that as proof that retail stores are winning. He who converts sales wins. Not him who gives free advertising for the other guy.
