What's with the price confusion in BB store and website. Bought an $80 heart rate monitor and at checkout went on BB website. It was $40. Tell cashier and they change an $80 item to $40. Told another person I saw in that area to check online. They saved also. The next visit was to look at a turntable around $400. They push so hard and bring this sales pitchy vibe to a $2000 turntable. I've had numerous negative experiences. Wish them well since competition is good but stop with the games.
