"Maybe he is now - I saw his site probably 7 years ago. The reason I don't take the critic seriously is because it seems that he has a personal vendetta against Kiyo for whatever reason. I'm guessing he has a chip on his shoulder because he disagrees with some of Kiyo's advice, and is pissed off at how much success it brought him. As such, all of his information is extremely negatively biased. It's difficult to separate the facts from everything else. Hence, he is not a reliable source. A reliable and trustworthy source is not biased, and lays out all the facts, good and bad, so that you can create your own opinion. I take RDPD seriously (mind you, it'd been 10+ years since I've read it) because the advice is overwhelmingly good and positive. Even if a small percentage I disagree with, overall it's still a very good book. I always say: RDPD => Millionaire Mind => Think & Grow Rich + Greatest Salesman in the World (the last 2 at the same time). I politely disagree that the ""opening the mind"" thing is overestimated, because by definition it's not something that you can overestimate. It is everything, and nothing is more important. The mind is the source of all the money, all your happiness, all your misery. Unless you first get your mind right, it will be impossible for you to become rich (barring some extremely lucky event, such as winning a lottery or getting inheritance). This is why the majority of people who win lotteries go broke - even if the money falls on your lap, unless your mind is ready for it, off it goes again! ""Opening the mind"" as you put it is really the first step - it's what makes everything else possible. So you're damn right that it's worth feeling elated about. :)"
