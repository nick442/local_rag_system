"fire your brother's friend and get another accounting major who'll listen to orders and won't try anything dodgy. You might have to pay well for that. Make sure your whole family is on the same page with future plans EDIT: I just read that you think your brother is going to do a takeover. It's your family's business. He's your brother. It's not really a ""hostile takeover"". If you don't trust your own brother you have to work on the relationship not the business. EDIT 2: I checked your profile. Stop doing drugs"
