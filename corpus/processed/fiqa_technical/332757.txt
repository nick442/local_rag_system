"Not really. It will mostly come down to his personality and if he takes it personally. Don't feel bad. If he doesn't have a necessary expertise that you don't, he's not the right partner for you. Don't delay. It would have been better for you to nip it at the very beginning, but oh well. In the conversation, you'll have to mention his inexperience at some point. Buuuuut, try to make it more about you than him. Don't have the majority of the sentences be ""**You're** not this"" or ""**You** can't this"". Instead, make it about you and frame the reasons as an internal force you're grappling with. One that you can't fully control but must follow. ""**I** have this vision"" and ""**I** have been soul searching and doing research and now realize that **I** need full creative control"". If you've had any disagreements on serious issues about this business, use them. Mention them and talk about how uncertain the market is. That you might have to take an extreme turn, pivot the business, and that you don't want to listen to anybody or be beholden to anybody. Say you're being selfish but that you want to do it now to avoid conflict in the future. Making the dynamic about you vs. a passionate irresistible drive that you must follow..rather than you vs. him should help a good deal. You want the business for yourself. You are correct in this desire. You can't hide that fact so don't cover up or lie about this point, but make the reasons not necessarily about him. Mention high profile cases like Facebook and Tesla and how they split friendships up."
