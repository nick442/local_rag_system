You would need to look at all aspects: - Current Rate of Interest in US compare to China - Current Exchange rate and the rate in Future when you want the money back - Any tax / Regulatory implications of keeping the money in US - Any furture regulations that may hamper your access to these funds If you are planning to stay in China and at some point in time want to get the money back, In my opinion it would make more sense to do it today like you are doing, rather than take the risk of exchange rate and regulations. Further the current low risk returns in US are near zero. The inflation in US is of no concern to you. On the other hand you have a decent return in China. If you know that at some point in future you would need USD [either moving to US, or large purchase in USD], then it would make sense to keep the funds in USD.
