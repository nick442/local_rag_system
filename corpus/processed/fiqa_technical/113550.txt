Again, I don't have the answers, but it seems to me as though the value of stock in a company should be directly correlated somehow to the real world value - what it holds in assets, the demand for its services or products. And when you see IPOs of tech stocks with prices exponentially greater than their revenues, or derivatives that when unravelled are nothing but air, or intraday fits and runs that seem to be tied to nothing in particular, then it all starts to look like nothing but manipulation. Maybe you're right, there's nothing wrong with HFT and a tax on it wouldn't add stability, I can't say. And if you explained it, I must not have understood. But I don't think its wrong for people to consider the current (or past) instability undesirable and try to think of solutions.
