Lmao dude I'm not going to give any specifics on Reddit, how dumb are you? But I work in infrastructure / P&U, currently working on a ~$2.5bn infra deal so can't complain. I really have nothing to prove to a college kid with a bruised ego that probably wont make it into IB and has a long career of insurance sales ahead of them. Best of luck :)
