Actually, the Richmond Group owns a lot of movement makers. (ETA, Unitas, Valjoux, etc.) What this will do is, as they said, shut down all of the impostors that buy movements from them. Why spend thousands of dollars on a Cartier or a Longines, when you can get the same movement from a different company for a couple of hundred bucks. Now the different company will have to buy their movements from China, which does not hold a lot of weight in a collector's market.
