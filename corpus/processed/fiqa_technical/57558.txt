Completely agree with this, especially with the level 2 comment. Some sections in the Schweser level 2 books are quite scarce, and will need additional research. I just passed level 2 this June, and I have pretty much never used the CFAI materials; they are very long and time consuming, whereas the Schweser resources were much shorter, yet still comprehensive enough. Of course, you are in this to improve yourself and learn as much as you can about the world of finance, so if you are not under time pressure, perhaps it may be better for your long term understanding to learn the content from the CFAI resources. One thing I would stress is to do the Mock exams and topic tests on the CFA website, as this is probably the most important component of your studies. Use these resources to find your weaknesses and fill in the gaps from there. You should skim read those blue boxes which contain worked examples, but personally I found the end of chapter questions to be too easy and a waste of time tbh. Hope that helps a bit; all the best for your studies. TL;DR Schweser materials are more concise and a better option Regardless of what you use, do official CFA mocks & topic tests
