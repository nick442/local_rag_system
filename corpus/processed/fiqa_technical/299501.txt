"It really depends. I find it useful, but then again I'm the kid that went to professor's office hours just to learn more. Others that have the same degree from same school think it's useless, but these are the kids that didn't go to professor's office hours to learn more. As far as public thought, it is generally seen as subpar, but if you have an entrepreneur spirit you don't have to worry about ""landing"" a job. Economics will equip you well for the right type of person. If you want to be a worker bee, I suggest accounting or finance."
