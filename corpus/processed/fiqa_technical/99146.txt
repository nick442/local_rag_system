Not at all. I love McD's! Their coffee beats the ever living shit out of Tim Horton's swill (yes, I'm Canadian). Their sandwiches, especially the McChicken, are great (though I think Wendy's makes a better burger). Their restaurants, particularly after the recent renovations, are clean, comfortable, and the staff are well trained. Hating McD's is easy because they're so big, and have been so successful for so long. They appeal to the masses, and no one wants to admit that they belong to that class.
