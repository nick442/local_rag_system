So, to be clear, you think a two year old, stunningly-beautiful property, is about to go vacant for an extended period? Because I'll bet Reddit Gold, or anything you like, that it reopens, as a casino, probably before the end of the year, at worst - sometime next year. Someone always gobbles properties like this up, the questions are who, how long does it take, when does it re-open, and can they avoid the same fate?
