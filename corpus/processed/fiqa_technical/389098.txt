I realize this is a dated question, but for anyone interested in this subject please be aware of the availability of IRC § 1235 and capital gain treatment for the sale of patents. When the holder of a patent transfers all substantial rights to an unrelated person, it can qualify for long-term capital gain treatment. That can be a meaningful tax savings relative to ordinary income treatment. There are a number of specific provisions and requirements to access § 1235. The holder must be the creator or someone unrelated (and not the creator's employer) who purchased the patent from the creator. The holder must transfer all substantial rights to the patent (not a licensing), or sell an undivided portion of all substantial rights (partial sale, again not a license). The benefit of § 1235 is that long-term treatment will apply even for patents with holding periods under 1 year. Other rules and permutations of course also apply. Those who fail § 1235 may still qualify their assets as capital under § 1221 or § 1231. A patent held by its creator will often qualify as a capital asset. It may not make any sense to sell your business as a whole, particularly if all a purchaser wants is a patent or group of patents. Of course, if the patent was held by its creator in a single-member LLC or other disregarded entity sold to a buyer, then the tax treatment is still treated as the sale of a long-term capital asset.
