How much damage has he done to the brand now, though? His name is a lot of his value AFAIK and now it will have very negative connotations forever except in specific demographics. You'd imagine he's knocked a fair amount of the value already. And I'm sceptical about the poorer rural one they're pursuing, because sooner or later his policies are going to bite them and he won't be popular there either.
