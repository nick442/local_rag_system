not really one to argue semantics, retail stores are closing by the dozen these days as Amazon looks to purchase brick and motor locations like Sears and Whole Foods. A few choices today, talk to me in 10 years. You may be to young, I don't know but the same was said about Verizon early on and now it pretty much controls communications, Amazon is on the same highway, very soon they will control the majority of retail.
