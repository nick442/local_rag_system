w/o the winklevoss twins, Zuckerberg wouldn't be a billionaire. Not that he wouldn't be successful, or he owes them anything, but w/o their idea of a social network, he very likely would have done something different. Worked hard, but it may or may not have worked. He is both skilled, hard working, and lucky.
