"I'm not aware of banks offering savings account for specific reasons, other than certain accounts for college funds, as the number of reasons someone might want to open a savings account is almost infinite. What I did was open 3 savings accounts with the same bank (I could have opened more, but I didn't need more). Each account is labeled with a nickname for it's specific purpose: Vacation, Emergencies, and Annual fees. This way, I can make automated deposits to each one based on my monthly budgets and track them independently. Most E-Banks offer this type of setup (CapitalOne even advertises it as a ""feature"") and the interest rate will likely be better than a standard brick-and-mortar bank."
