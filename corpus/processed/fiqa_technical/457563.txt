What you are looking for is : Volatility http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance) Normally you can't trade that directly per product, but a product like the VIX as a whole. Another option (sorry for the pun) is that certain option greeks deal with Volatility (vega I think?). There are ways to value options to buy/sell against that options/products volatility - but has some other side affects besides just pure trading of the Volatility. You'll probably need a lot of Math and use of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-Scholes to fully understand/trade on it though.
