This might be a bit of r/conspiracy thinking but: DOL fiducary rule has siginfcatly altered investment companies ability to make money on qualifed accounts. Many are still struggling to figure out how to adopt, monitor and be in compliance with it. This will hit the insurance companies hard too especially variable annuities providers since it is that much more difficult to justify their high cost products for rollovers unders DOL. If you reduce the limit to 2,400 people are going to have to find other places to put money to continue to save. If you already saving 18,000 or 10,000 or 5,000 a year your going to need a new place to put that money. What other products are there that are tax deferred for non qualifed money? after tax annuities. And since these dollars are no longer in qualified plans they are not subjected to the DOL fiducary rules. If a variable annuity company comes out with a hybrid Qualified / non qualified account that allows you to have one contract with two accounts in it, the fix is in. So maybe the insurance companies or the financial services companies lobbying groups or supported think tanks came up with the idea and served it to the government. My tin foil hat is bolted on.
