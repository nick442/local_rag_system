I'll add Robert Shiller's [Irrational Exuberance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrational_Exuberance_(book) too, to summarize the recent era of Wall Street booms and busts. The best books I've ever read on finance are [Nassim Taleb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassim_Nicholas_Taleb)'s. But they're mostly about his own analysis of financial phenomena, and they approach financial history mostly from that highly unique viewpoint.
