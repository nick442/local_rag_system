They did. This was a tech company. Turnover's high especially for strong employees. Management expects this so that doesn't really change their approach. One of the layoffs was open ended. They just announced there would be layoffs throughout the company. Usually there was a single day when everyone was cut. This one dragged on and on. If your group wasn't hit yet, everyone was stressed wondering when it was coming. If your group was already hit, the manager would say you still weren't safe cuz it could come around again (which did happen to some groups). Managers either didn't know when the layoff was over or weren't allowed to tell. After a few months we were sure it was over but then another nearby group would get hit. It was horrible. Productivity was way down. Finally after about 3 months, they announced the layoffs were over. (And then had another layoff later that year). So, yeah, it sucked.
