I think women are at risk from it because they have a need to become self employed not a want. If you don't have a rich husband you have a choice between going back to work after your maternity leave (if you're in a country which will give you one) or being on single mom benefits. Neither are appealing. I'm self employed which means I can spend time with my baby and have money. People probably assume it's because I am part of a mlm scheme too! In my opinion mlms usually target women because of this.
