"They wouldn't have a low price liquidation. ""Liquidator companies"" buy them, re-tag everything to make them appear to be deals, then put up signs like ""fire sale!"" all over. This happened with Circuit City most notably and with the internet, it was exposed and even mocked how fake and misleading the sell-off was. It was their swan song of rip-offs and they executed it perfectly..at first. There is no liquidation sale. It was all just another campaign of behavioral economics to prime you into buying decisions."
