Oh that's so wonderful I haven't seen anything like that since..1966. When I looked into the heating/AC room for a coliseum where the Beatles were gonna play, and each pipe, each vent, was painted a different bright color. It was like the Room of Roots in Gormenghast where all the roots are painted different colors. >The bole of the tree they once nourished enters in seven main roots which even down to the minutest rivulet of root, were painted in their own special colours, so that it appeared as though seven coloured boles had forced their leafless branches through the window, yellow, red and green, violet and pale blue, coral pink and orange. The concentration of effort needed for the execution of this work must have been considerable, let alone the almost superhuman difficulties and vexation that must have resulted from the efforts to establish, amoung the labyrinthic entanglements of finer roots, which tendril belonged to which branch, which branch to which limb, which limb to which trunk, for only after discovering its source could its correct colour be applied. Beautiful. Which technology sometimes can be.
