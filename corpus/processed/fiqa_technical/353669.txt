>Budweiser is one of the highest quality products ever produced. Don't conflate consistency and quality. Yes, Budweiser produces an impeccably consistent product, with effectively zero batch variation. And, yes, accomplishing that is tremendously difficult, and it requires a lot of skill. But so what? McDonald's hamburger patties are virtually identical whether you go to a franchise in Alaska or Florida; that doesn't mean they're a quality product. I can use a compass and a ruler to make thousands of perfectly identical stick figures, but I wouldn't be heralded as an artistic genius. Budweiser is not a quality product. It's just a consistent one.
