sorry, things got busy. active calendar management. Are you talking about having a dedicated receptionist manage say an exchange calendar? taking calls, making an appointment on your calendar and then saving the event and setting reminders? that kind of thing? outgoing calls to confirm appointments sounds interesting, but currently we only want to deal with inbound, process then transfer.
