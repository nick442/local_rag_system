Many people think money velocity is the most important thing in the economy that is why war is *good* for the economy. But during WWII the USA and all others countries had rationing. The whole reason to have a better economy is so we can live better lives; not to put rationed on but we can buy. After WWII where peoples lives better? No we(US) had 418,500 dead, many wounded and many years of rationing. Same apples to Hurricane Harvey families had homes and jobs. Now they have nothing. Just because they are spending retirement fund on rebuilding doesn't mean their lives are better. So yes there is more velocity in money in where Hurricane Harvey hit. But it is happening for the wrong reasons.
