That may be true but what will happen is that every carrier raises prices. In an oligopoly it will be an opportunity to act as an ensemble. So maybe after a while costs will be driven down but in the short it will probably only raise prices. And also it creates a situation where the a service that was previously accessible to all customers will now only be available to the ones willing to pay whatever the cost of an actual human behind the telephone is. So in the short run it will only increase telecom costs. Also since having a phone or internet in something you can just opt out of everyone will be more or less forced to accept this practice. Again the oligopoly is where can find the cause.
