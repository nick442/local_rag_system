Now I don't know the history of banks but from the overall idea of a bank, it seems like they were created to help people organize and have control of their money. I think they've changed a lot, and every company is out to make money, but the bottom line is that they're there for you. You don't have to use a bank if you don't want to (though it may be difficult to get through life without doing so). Lol why would I get downvoted, that doesn't make any sense.
