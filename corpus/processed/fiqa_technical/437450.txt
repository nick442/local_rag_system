I'm pretty sure employees were instructed to give loans to people who they knew would not be able to pay it back. [This](http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2011/12/01/379332/former-banker-subprime-pushed/) (about chase rather than BoA but still relevant) is just from a quick search but the key phrase is predatory lending. So they give out all these loans they knew were at risk and then packaged them up in investments that looked good from the outside but were rotten within. So from what I gather they basically double fucked both people who shouldn't have taken a loan, and then people who invested in whatever investment packages they were selling. Now you know more about the technicalities of all this than I do, so let me ask. What is it that they *did* do that was unscrupulous?
