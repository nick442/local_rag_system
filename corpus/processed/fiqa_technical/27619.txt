> This is without a doubt the craziest and most despicable moment in American History. Whoa there, calm down. Not to diminish the reality of what's happening here but this is essentially an argument over paperwork and a little bit of money. A couple hundred years ago my great great great (x?) grandparents were abducted and dragged across the ocean at a poor survival rate to work for free and were summarily brutalized as property and forcibly impregnated, raped, and 'bred' like livestock. If you're giving me a choice between 'President too close to his business' and 'kidnap and displace a million people to use them for labour and breeding stock', I'm not sure how that's even a choice.
