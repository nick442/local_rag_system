Why should the costs of mandatory services be based on a sliding scale? Why shouldn't everyone pay the exact same price for the same services? Would it be fair if you walked into a McDonalds and everyone was lined up based on income with everyone below a certain level expecting everyone above the line to pay their way? Edit. If you were on the side of the line that was subsidized would you vote to end the subsidies or vote for policies that add more people to the side that gets free things so you can continue to get free things?
