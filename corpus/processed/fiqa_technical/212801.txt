> You don't see effects of monetary and fiscal policies in the first months or in rare cases even years. The debt went up sharply in the first months of Obama's presidency. Check it. The debt went down a bit under Trump and it's impossible that it has nothing to do with his actions. Once Trump implement his actions, which I support, you will see SHARP decline in the debt.
