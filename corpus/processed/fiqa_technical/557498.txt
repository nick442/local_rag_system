"I have been trying to find information about how banks ""create"" money by giving out loans while only having a portion of the money to lend. And any broader implications this may have (ie, all new money is debt?). And the implications of the the government increasing or decreasing the required reserve amount. I hope I explained that in a coherent way. BTW, I love the investopedia videos. If you can in any way emulate that technique, it should be a hit. good luck."
