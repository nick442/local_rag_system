"just curious what qualifies this as a ""hedge fund"". is it structured as an LLC? are they charging Apple 2%/20% fees? are they shorting or using derivatives or leverage to manage risk or amplify returns? are they employing sophisticated investment strategies? are they managing funds for outside investors? sounds to me like a standard cash management and tax avoidance operation of a (very large) corporation that somebody is calling a ""hedge fund"" to claim it is the world's largest. I'm sure most major corporations are running something similar to this and nobody calls them hedge funds."
