Elance, UpWork, Fivver Who would've thought taking skilled labor and watering down the price to mere pennies would be bad for everybody involved? That's why, even though I operate just like a freelancer, I incorporated. Legally, I'm a sole proprietor, not a freelancer..aside the few tax differences, it just saves me a ton of headaches.
