so i'm an older millenial living in a large metro. I'm in a situation where the trendy urban/downtown neighborhoods apts/condos are way to expensive for me because the demand is so high, but up until recently i can't afford a house in the outer, newer burbs either. so i'm left renting apartments in inner suburbs.
