">The Chevy Bolt has a 50% larger battery for practically the same price. As far as I can tell, the Chevy Bolt has a 60kWh battery and 238 mile advertised range, and it's base price is more expensive than the Tesla Model 3. Further, no other ""available"" electric vehicle has a 200+ mile range. BMW i3 has max 114 miles on a charge, Fiat 500e is 87 miles, VW eGolf with range extender 125mi. Further, nobody else is offering an ""affordable"" EV with that range AND self-driving capability."
