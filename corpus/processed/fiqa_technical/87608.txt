First a business should produce where it can most efficiently produce product. If I make clothing and I can get 16 times the work force making 16 times the t shirts I would go there. By introducing more t shirts to the market I make them cheaper to buy for consumers like yourself. 20 years ago did you own a computer? How much was it to buy? How much would a computer cost now? What kind of things do you own now compared to 20 years ago? Every has much more buying power now than 20 years ago.
