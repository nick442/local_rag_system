"But I think another interesting postscript to this which is relevant at this time is that the orchard wildfire isn't the only thing that can make money ""disappear"". The use of a currency rather than a transferable note means that it can be an independent store of value, so there are perverse outcomes that can happen that can't happen with IOUs. So say some particularly wealthy person in the village starts to hoard his money and corners a large fraction of the money supply (say he's anticipating some horrible plague). The number of Loddars decreases, and the orchard owner starts paying his workers fewer Loddars as a result. But their debts are denominated in ""old"" Loddars which were easier to come by, and quickly the workers are unable to pay their debts, or have to spend all their money on their debts and have none for anything else. They default on those debts and the money ""disappears""--but it doesn't disappear for any physical reason (the workers are doing the same amount of work), it disappears because of a shock to the monetary supply. This is a ""demand shock"" versus the ""supply shock"" of an orchard catching on fire."
