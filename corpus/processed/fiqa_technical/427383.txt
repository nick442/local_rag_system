I hear the idea that TV has turned to crap a lot, but I don't really buy it. I agree that TV is crap, but I think it's *always* been crap; we just didn't notice, because it was all there was. The internet gives us access to so much that the standard deviation of quality becomes larger, and the fact that the TV industry was never really that good to begin with has become more readily apparent. It's sort of the same reason you find both the shortest & tallest people in China- the population is bigger, so the standard deviation of height is just statistically larger.
