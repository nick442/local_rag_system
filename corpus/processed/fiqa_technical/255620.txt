It's in tax breaks. They arent paying the factory that much, they just aren't charging it. Currently, there is no factory, so why not just give them a break in taxes for the first few years to attract more business which is really good for your people? Otherwise the factory can open up somewhere else, and it does provide a benefit, so that other state will be happy to not charge them taxes for the first few years.
