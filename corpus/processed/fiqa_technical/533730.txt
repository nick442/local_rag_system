I deleted my previous comment. Here's an illustration: Let's say you're betting in a horse race. This horse race allows anyone who's willing to take bets during the race to do so. So you bet on horse A Another guy bets on horse B Your horse (a) runs the race normally. The guy on horse B, however, notices his horse will lose but that C is going to win. So he sends a bunch of his friends to the ticket counter ahead of time. Then, when he wants to be on C he just has a friend bet for him. He can do that while you're stuck at the back of the line. In the market, they can distribute the orders among each other in the same way. The friends are just servers but they let everyone know when the orders are coming in. They don't know before he places the order but once he does they're already in line faster than you can be in line.
