If your ideal world is one where the government keeping companies from maiming and killing people to make a buck is coddling, it is not a world I want to share with you. There is also a story I can't remember the specifics of and thus can't pull up at 6 AM in the morning, where an American car company knew there were some serious safety flaws in a car after full production had began, and they calculated that the cost of the recall would be greater than that of the inevitable liability lawsuits, so they let people die in order to lose less money. Once word of this plot got out, they eventually got heavily fined by the government for basically being soulless bastards as I recall, but the point is this would be the norm in a world where what you want to happen happens. I would love it if someone could pull up an article so I don't sound crazy.
