>I don't think we're going to see a world where there's no menial labor for a very long time. I don't think it'll be in my lifetime, but I don't think it's too far off in the grand scheme of things. Self-driving vehicles and cashier-less stores/quick serve restaurants are well within the realm of possibility in several decades, and those are two of the largest employment industries in the US. It's worth starting to talk about, because it's going to take a *massive* shift in ideology (that is, we might have to start thinking seriously about universal basic income omg the horror) in order to not blow up.
