I never said all public employees fly first class. I worked in the public sector for 3 years and flew economy and most of colleagues did as well so I agree that most public employees fly coach. Maybe I didn't explain what I did before starting a business. As a computer programmer for 15 years, I've worked for 2 private companies and 1 publicly-funded educational organization. Public or private, I've always flown economy except for a couple of times where I was bumped to first class by the airline. A lot of people fly coach when taking personal trips so it would be hypocritical of them to demand first class from their employer for business trips. I guess it just pisses me off when people brag that they fly first class or business class or booked a posh hotel room with a view when their paycheck comes from tax dollars or union dues.
