All of your 401k income is taxable and no more than 85% of your SS income. You can use the worksheets in IRS: Publication 915 to determine what percentage of your SS is taxable. Just as with ordinary income, deductions/exemptions apply and not all that is taxable will be taxed. When you begin drawing SS you'll have the option to have taxes withheld at various rates, more convenient than quarterly estimated payments in my opinion.
