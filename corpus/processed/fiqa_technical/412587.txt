"> Another way of looking at it: most people think that the way to promote hiring women is to make them better potential employees, but another way to do it is to make men worse potential employees (by giving them the same time off). Nothing more than lowering the bar. Just like all the misinformation thrown around about the ""assault on women"" and the fictitious ""pay gap"", a majority of women *choose* to be the family member that takes time off from work. Making men ""worse potential employees"" doesn't change much since women will still choose to take the time off. As a result, you have *two* people not showing up for work, as opposed to just one."
