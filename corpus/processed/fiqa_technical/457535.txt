Maybe you know something I don't, but as far as I'm aware, you can't get rid of it. **Student loans are with you for life**. You will be sent to collections, but it doesn't disappear after 7 years. Settlements are incredibly rare unless your loan is ballooning.. in which case, a settlement doesn't change all that much. You will lose tax benefits, the government will garnish 15% of your wages, and you will be a debt slave until it's paid off. Defaulting on student loans is much, much more painful than defaulting on private loans. The *only* exception to this is if you've made 120 months of repayments while employed at a qualifying non-profit or governmental organization. And even then, it only applies to federal loans and there are exceptions (better not refinance or the clock resets, for example). Also, if you default, you will no longer be eligible. Private student loans have no escape hatch and are equally unforgiving. Thank your elected representatives.
