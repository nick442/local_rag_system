News are the only thing keeping it together. We can all read entire newspapers on the Web, but the percentage of people that still enjoys reading the morning paper is huge. TV and radio have the advantage of being live (and a live broadcast from a website is still radio/television) - if something huge happens worldwide, you'll always turn your TV on, it's still more connectable than websites. A part from that, I don't see any other advantages comparing to the internet.
