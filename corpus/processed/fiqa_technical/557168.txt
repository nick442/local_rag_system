"Thank you very much for your humility- it serves you well in your obvious desire to maintain an intellectually correct position. I concede that you point out a generally bothersome and dishonest tactic in debate in which people ""move the goal posts"" in pursuit of ""winning"" an argument by shifting the subject of the argument itself. In this case, I'd hope you'd see that the person I was speaking with was so far in agreement with me (when held to the larger context of the discussion- consider the subreddit we are in) that my intent was not even to argue with them but to refine their own claim. The two of us weren't in any kind of disagreement, we simply hadn't agreed upon basic terminology."
