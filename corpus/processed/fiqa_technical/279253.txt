Usa is at the point where we either tell all the countries that we aren't paying the debt or keep pretending that one day we will be able too. Our economy relies so much on military and government spending that if we cut it too much at once we risk a shock to the market. If we cut slowly we might be able to turn the country's budget to positive and start paying but so much debt and so much spending it could be a hundred plus years.
