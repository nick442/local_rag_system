I make dolls of a couple of co-workers and burn them in effigy. In meetings, a thumbtack in the shoe works: press your toe against it until you feel a little pain. This distracts from the emotional toll of insults and frustrations. When being insulted directly in front of co-workers, I find that it helps to think of the aspects of my life I should be grateful for: the key is, no matter what, do not cry. Tears a real career-killer. As for situations where a boss or co-worker physically threatens you, I recommend breathing deeply and making no sudden movements.
