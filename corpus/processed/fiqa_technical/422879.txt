"From a talk by entrepreneur and investor Gary Vaynerchuk: @2:37: Look yourself in the mirror and ask yourself: ""What do I want to do every day for the rest of my life?"" Do that. I promise you can monetize that shit. @12:04: I don't want to hear about this ""9 to 5, I don't have time"" thing. If you want this, if you have a passion, work 9 to 5, spend a couple hours with your family, 7[pm] to 2 in the morning it's plenty of time to do damage. But that's it; it's not gonna happen any other way. @You work 9 to 6, you get home, you kiss the dog, and you go to town. Everybody has time. Stop watching fucking Lost. If you want this, if you want bling-bling, if you want to buy the Jets, work. That's how you get it."
