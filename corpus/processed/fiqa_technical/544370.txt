My response was actually about the stupidity of nitpicking and the fallaciousness of the public preoccupation with minimalist government spending. I made no argument that the government need to be lavish. And I agree, first class is not necessary in almost all cases. But it is easier to be productive in first class. And if you're competing with the private sector for talent, there are certain places that skimping is both counter to productivity and strategic outcomes. You want the best medical doctors working for the NIH and the CDC. Forcing shitty working conditions on them out of rigid demands is not a useful tactic. And, again, I agree: harassing entry level and working class employees over small issues isn't good for the staff, the government or the people they serve. If you want to find CHIP and food programs, quit giving out corporate welfare in the form of overpurchasing military hardware the Pentagon doesn't even want just for the sake of chest thumping and looking good. And stop insisting that all taxes are spent inefficiently - it's untrue. But making highly educated, powerful government employees live on the cheapest possible benefits and costs of employment is silly. And counterproductive - it moves you closer to ensuring government dollars are inefficient because no one talented will bother staying.
