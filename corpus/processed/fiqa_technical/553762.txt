Capital requirements for a de novo bank, as opposed to an established one, are a real bitch. Basically the government wont let you loan nearly as much of your money out. You can't skirt this by buying an existing bank. Regulators don't want upstarts making stupid loans and thus encouraging lower credit criteria systemwide. Also Incumbents don't want more competition and they have lobbyists so I don't see this changing soon.
