It is a paid internship. That is worthwhile enough. I work IB operations for a bulge bracket ibank and last year interning with them it started out with mundane things. Ask for more work, show them you are responsible, and things will get much better and far more productive. Truly, last summer was an incredible experience once I got settled in. It is worth the line on your resume, the networking abilities, and the future professional references just to tough it out, even if it doesn't get any better (which it will). The absolute WORST thing you can do in a job is leave unprofessionally and ruin the chance of getting any kind of recommendation in the future.
