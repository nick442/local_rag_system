Actually that's a much better proposition to price an app. There is the fear of cannibalising your own premium offering by providing a cheaper solution that also hampers (or limits) the app experience. You think anchoring won't happen in reverse with the lowest price point being the reference point? Also, I as a customer will feel confused if there is a free version, a lite version, a freemium version, an ad supported version, a full version and a premium version. Keep it simple.
