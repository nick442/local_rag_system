Ahh.. Well I joined twitter when they first started (mid 2003 or 2004?), and handles like @john were available. Annoyed with myself I didn't bother to snag any actually, could have made a mint. But that said, I still use it today and I've never noticed a single ad. Facebook in the other hand, is teaming with ads - some I even *want* to click on. So I guess that should still answer the question. Unless McDonalds is going to start sending me private messages to get my attention?
