Yeah dang. Guess it's probably written deep in the contract that this can happen and nothing is absolutely guaranteed. Any specific experience on rental car chains? I've recently started using National and love the pick your own car experience..much faster and smoother but is more expensive (and luckily reimbursed mostly as well)
