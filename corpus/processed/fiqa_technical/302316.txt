"> Fiat money backed by sovereign nations who can control you with their military. I don't think bitcoin has the same kind of backing. That's kind of the point. People are choosing to use bitcoin voluntarily; forcing them by gunpoint isn't really what it's about. It's supposed to be free market money, not fiat (""by decree""). Bitcoin succeeds by both being competitive and resistant to hostilities from central authorities, it doesn't succeed through coercion. That's a sign of its strength imo. If it had a military backing it I certainly wouldn't support it. The sooner we can free our monetary systems from the influence of violent coercion, the better."
