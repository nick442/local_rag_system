Just common courtesy. It seems to me that some people bring their extremely rough social skills from their home life and apply it to work. There does not seem to be any training at all on how to greet people and what is appropriate behavior. A lot of this, I'm sure, is regional. When I visit other parts of the country I do notice a marked difference. The retail drones in NY are *particularly* awful.
