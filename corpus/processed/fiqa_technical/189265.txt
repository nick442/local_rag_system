"If I had to guess, I think Chipotle's queso is the way it is because Chipotle is trying to maintain their ""wholesome, quality ingredients"" approach to queso. But that's the problem: naturally made cheeses don't melt into liquids. If anyone has worked in the pizza business for any period of time, then they might know at least one thing about cheese: melted cheese has a very high oil content. Mix your cheese with a shit load of oil and it can melt beautifully. Want your cheese to stay in a liquid state at a lower temperature? Add more oil. So if you want to maintain wholesome, arguably healthy ingredients and make queso at the same time, then you've got a problem because it's damn hard to make liquid cheese without having it be the worst thing imaginable for your health. After trying Chipotle's queso last week, I guessed that they were trying to make a not-so-miserable-for-your-health version of queso, so they made a queso without all of the added oil. But that's the problem: oil is fucking delicious. Pretty much anything that is high in fats (like oil) or sugars tastes amazing. The higher the fat and/or sugar content, the better it tastes, but also the worse it is for your health, generally. So Chipotle has a queso that isn't godawful for your health, but it also tastes like it. I applaud Chipotle's willingness to experiment with new products and try new things, but I'm projecting that this queso won't have mass appeal because it doesn't taste great. A group of us bought a cup of it, and we didn't finish it. Sorry, Chipotle. I like the effort; but if I want chips & queso, my ass is rollin' across the street to Q'doba to get some of that terrible-for-my-health, zero-nutritional-value, yellow-oil-cheese-product deliciousness."
