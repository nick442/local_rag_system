Programmer here. Getting into business is more than just tech knowledge. It's great that you were able to get some money for what you did. But setting up a business requiring figuring out a solution to a problem. When it's easy to identify a problem, it's not easy to come up with a viable solution (otherwise someone else would have already solved it). At other times, you figure out a very limited scoped problem and figure out a solution, but it's not very scalable. My advice to you. Keep learning. You are very young and there is a lot of fun things you can do. If you think you are already standing out with your skills, get an online profile going. Get popular. Try all channels. Should be fun.
