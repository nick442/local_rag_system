That's not how dota works, though. People have been playing the same game (with regular major updates) for almost a decade now. Many players retire to become commentators/coaches/streamers/other important parts of the scene and earn a living that way. Sure, there are more lucrative jobs out there, but if he's passionate about it and can make a career out of it, what's the problem?
