Exactly. Bosses/managers often frame things in terms of 'you should be thankful for us giving you a paycheck each week' when by definition, you are being paid less than your labour, strictly speaking, is worth. ie, on the whole what you do is paying the company MORE than you receive. Personally, I'm fine with this trade off, within reason. I get to go home at 5, and if the phone rings I ignore it if I like. If the place folds, no one is coming after me for a share of the company's debts, either. But don't let anyone blow smoke that by paying you they are being generous.
