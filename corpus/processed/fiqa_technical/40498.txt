">Los Angeles is ordering the company to pay about $900,000 to the employees within the next month. The company is also being fined $541,000 in penalties How is this a whopping fine? Under federal law the minimum penalty is 100%. CA law provides for a fine of 1 months pay for a single infraction. Considering one of the charges is ""blocking investigators from interviewing employees"" and they are completely unrepentant and pretty much thumbing their nose at LA and wage laws in general, this is a paltry slap on the wrist for a company with $1.33 billion in revenue."
