"buying at Amazon is still retail, just not brick and mortar. The ""Magnet store in the Mall"" idea is dead, it isn't cost effective, the consumer doesn't want a ""department store"" in malls. They want small shops with tailored items and they will get everything else online. Also, cost comparisons make it about economy of scale here, not online vs offline. That is why it is devolving to a Amazon vs Wal-Mart fight, they have the pockets to fund this expansion.."
