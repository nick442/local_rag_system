In some countries, the mafia is an accepted part of the system (like some areas in Italy). In this country it is not, but government taxes are as they provide services that the people want. That is decided by the majority, not by the individual. And, if you individually choose to not partake of that system you can either face criminal results or you can head out for a country with low/no taxes. I hear Somalia has no country taxes..
