Compliance is the future of finance in the U.S.A. Stop bitching and be grateful for the fact that you are being given a chance. There are millions of people working for extremely low equivalent pay around the world. (The average salary for a college graduate in Shenzhen, China is $475 per month. Don't think for a second that these grads aren't as smart or hardworking as you.) Look around and appreciate the modern marvels of engineering, public utilities, and technology that surround you. Applaud the fact that your fellow citizens are conscience enough to clean up after themselves. e.g. using proper receptacles. Take pride in the fact that you are bright, talented, and moving forward Good luck.
