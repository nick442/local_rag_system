There are a few considerations: Purely Financial: If you think you can make more than 6% (adjusted downward for the tax benefits of home interest deductions) on that $150K then no. Otherwise yes. Update: A good point was made in another answer, if the 401K is not a ROTH, the tax consequences of withdrawing a lump sum like that will probably tip the balance in most situations towards not paying off the house. Risk: Paying off a mortgage reduces your liquidity. That is, it is much harder to pull your money out of a house note than to sell off some stocks/funds/cds. Put simply, if you run into trouble and need a lot of money quickly would you rather have a paid off house or $150K in the bank/near-cash investments?
