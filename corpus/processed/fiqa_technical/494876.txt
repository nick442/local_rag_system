">The scales on the chart are not consistent, even in regards to stats the author purports to be comparable Scales (and especially missing zero-points) are one of the easiest ways to manipulate the perception of viewers of charts & graphs. Especially when we are dealing with exponential things -- even the choice of linear vs logarithmic can generate entirely different reactions to the same data. Add in cherry-picking and ""normalization"" of data, and such things are rife with the possibility of being misleading (often in ways that the creators of the charts themselves are entirely unaware of)."
