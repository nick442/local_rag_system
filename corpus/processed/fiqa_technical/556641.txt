All of their product is least effort, with the sole possible exception of their burgers. Their breakfast fare is strictly microwave, their chicken and fish are abominable, their fries have gone downhill, their coffee comes in a syrup bag (or used to) while McD's grinds their own beans. It all reeks of bottom dollar. Wendy's new burgers are indeed nice, but the old ones at least seemed to be honest burger meat, cut in squares and fried on site. I'm unconvinced that the new ones aren't in the same vein as the 1/3 lb. pre-cooked dry gray nastyburgers that both Burger King and McDonalds (and Carl's Jr.) have been trying to foist off; they are preformed into pseudo-natural shapes, if you haven't noticed. If so, they are definitely done better than the competition.
