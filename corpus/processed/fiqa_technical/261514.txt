Because the people creating the bubbles and making money on the bubbles are also major political campaign contributors. The home price rebound deserves an asterisk, btw - mansions are selling like hotcakes, middleclass homes not so much. Non-mansion home prices were rising for awhile because funds like Blackrock were buying them to rent while securitizing the rental income stream, but between management headaches (property management would be like, actually doing something constructive, which hedge funds don't do) and the shaky finances of a great proportion of renters, this gambit isn't working so well.
