I agree with those sentiments mostly, but will add that US will still clearly lead in tech in the foreseeable future, particularly for data and computing, as well as aerospace and general research. Another issue with China is that they are unable to globalize their businesses and tech the way US can because there is still a steep cultural barrier. The world still speaks English, not Chinese, so this will work heavily against China and their closed systems. And until that can be supplanted, China will always be one step behind, even if they will be strong in every other aspect. Also Trump is a temporary setback. The US may revitalize again under new leadership and galvanize themselves the way they did during and post world war. If the US wasn't so fucking lazy and irresponsible, they'd have every thing needed to be dominant the way they have been for so long, though this seems unlikely.
