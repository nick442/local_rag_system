"I was thinking more of a limit on the TOTAL # of patents (something fairly small, like maybe 10,000 total patents are allowed to be valid at any given moment in time), so that patent applications from multiple sources have to be somehow compared with each other to decide which would provide more societal-benefit by being allowed patent status. If you want to take the government (mostly) out of the picture, then maybe use an auction format - when a valid patent ""slot"" becomes available (due to a previously-granted patent expiring, or being invalidated due to court challenge), then anyone who wants their idea to get patent rights submits their application to an ""auction"" for that slot. Then the people who want to OWN the patent rights to any of those submitted ideas will bid for them. Whoever pays the top bid will get the patent rights for the concepts in the specific application they were targeting. This will force the people who are doing the bidding to basically do the ""due diligence"" on each patent application (instead of depending on the patent examiners), since they will not want to pay a lot of money to get the patent rights for an idea, only to have that patent's value be destroyed by being declared invalid in court. If you want to encourage small inventors to throw their hat into the ring, then set things up so that the money from the winning bid goes to the inventor who submitted the original application. This way, you get the best of both worlds - the inventor gets compensated (handsomely in most cases) for their good idea, and the idea being patented gets into the hands of someone with enough resources to exploit the idea in a broad scale."
