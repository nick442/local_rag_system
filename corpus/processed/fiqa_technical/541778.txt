Or valued like a company that is likely to lead the transition to EVs. What most people miss: to make 1M EVs/year you need at least 50GWh in batteries/year. This is an amount you cannot buy anywhere. Not even if you're Mercedes or BMW or GM. The only solution is to build dedicated factories for this, and that takes 3-5 years. Tesla has the forethought to realize this is the bottleneck and they moved early. So in 2020 each of the other car makers can maybe source enough batteries for 100K cars/year, while Tesla will make their own to the tune of 1M cars/year. This will change eventually, of course. But not anytime soon.
