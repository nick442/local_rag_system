When they made a counter offer they essentially rejected your offer, and you are no obligation to accept theirs. Nor are you obligated to your original offer. That is the risk a person takes when they make a counter offer. Their agent/representative should have advised them of this risk. Because time is of the essence in most of these transactions their delay with the extra round also made your original offer void. You were right to keep other properties in play.
