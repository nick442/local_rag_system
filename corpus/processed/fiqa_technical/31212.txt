"here is what I don't get . . .when they say ""Unwind"" does it mean put a corkscrew up their ass and twist? because if they mean sell it back int the market, the problem was that there was no market and thats why it ended up on the Feds balance sheet. There is still no market for those Toxic assets . . . so does that mean the Fed is going to write it off? I bet we see QE 4 before any unwinding"
