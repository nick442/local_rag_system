If it goes to a millionaire who continues to pay larger bills than others while unemployed then that money goes right back into the economy. The money for unemployment insurance is linked to compensation. If they are millionaires then their compensation has already paid for unemployment insurance. This idea that money is going to turn around and go to some others possibly through some other program is flatly wrong. Either you have unemployment insurance or you don't. You want to withhold unemployment insurance from rich people because you don't think they are worthy. That is an interesting idea, but so far it has never worked politically.
