I have been trading Forex and Futures as an independant Trader for almost 3 Years now, and unfortunately i have to agree with pizzlepaps statement that if you have to ask you probably should not be doing it at all. There is a bunch of information out there on futures trading but then again im wondering which futures exactly you want to trade? Are we talking about ES contracts? Dax Contracts? Dow Contracts? Crude Contracts? I mean im going to be honest here i really would like to be of help here but quite frankly i dont know how based on your question, so for now stay away from the futures market until you have done some heavy reading and defined your goals.
