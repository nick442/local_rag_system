I will not thank Amazon if they dry the lake, as you put it, I enjoy the Whole Foods experience of consistent quality and nice shopping environment, it is an unique kind of market. There are plenty of options for markets around here, from Costco to Wallmart, to Target to Aldi's to Publix to Win Dixie and plenty other smaller chains. So Amazon better don't ruin the only one where it is actually enjoyable to grocery shop. p.s. you're high :D
