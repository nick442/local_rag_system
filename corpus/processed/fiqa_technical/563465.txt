Wal Mart, as capitalists are wont to do, will start by making a decent deal with employees (not make it mandatory, decent $) and will end up having people driving 10 miles out of their way for less than the costs of the employee, and use it as a cudgel to get raises and advancement. Never trust a corporation. They are sociopaths, you know, since they are people in this greedy assed country and all.
