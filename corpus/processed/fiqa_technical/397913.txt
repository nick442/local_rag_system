Yes. It is luck that person will have no debilitating accidents or illness to give them crippling medical debt. It is luck that provides us with our family. It is skill that lets us choose trustworthy and resourceful people in our lives, but it is luck that they remain so. It is luck that those investments provide a healthy return, that the companies hire prudent management and do look to cheat their investors. Personal responsibility is all about choices, right? Those choices are only as good as the information and resources available. Access to resources and information is quite clearly not equal, and therefore the choices we make are built on foundations of chance. Too many people in America have a nasty habit asking people to tie their own shoes with one hand tied behind their back (or cut off), and blaming them when they trip.
