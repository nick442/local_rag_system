For estimating your take home salary, I suggest using one of the many free salary calculators available over the Internet. I personally use PaycheckCity.com, but there are plenty of others available. To calculate your allowances for the US Federal tax, you can use the worksheet attached to the form W-4. Similar form (with a similar worksheet) is available for state taxes, on the Illinois Department of Revenue web site.
