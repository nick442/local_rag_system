"It's not just a decade worth of saturation, it's several decades. My mom held on to all of my lego from when I was a kid, and just dumped it all on our kids. Not that I didn't want it, but one day out of the blue it was literally ""take this or I'm throwing it away"". It literally doubled the amount of blocks we had already. I'm sure this is happening all over the country."
