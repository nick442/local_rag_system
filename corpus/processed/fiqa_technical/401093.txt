Get a Bankrupsy lawyer. They'll tell you to stop paying the bills and use the money to pay their fee. Yes.. You do need to pay in advance. I can tell you honestly that it was the best thing that ever happened to me. Think about it this way.. When you loan someone moneyyou're placing a bet that they'll pay you back. You try to keep the dos in your favor by using credit ratings etc but sometimes you win and sometimes you lose that bet. It's nothing personal. It's business. The casino doesn't feel bad when you lose your bets and your money and you don't expect them to. The person placing the bet knows what they're doing and knows all about the risks, etc. it's a calculated risk. Again.. It's just business and it's nothing personal. It's also not nesessairly a failure. Depending on the situation.. Bankrupsy is an excellent business decision. Big business do it all the time. Sometimes bankruptcy is a very smart decision and not going bankrupt is the worst decision you can make. My only regret with my own bankruptcy is that I didn't do it sooner. I could have saved the family years of unnecessary hardship and I could have gotten it over with much sooner. Don't be emotional. Be smart and do the smart thing.
