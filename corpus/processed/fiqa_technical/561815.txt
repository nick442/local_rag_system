Pretty sure that's a theory for one. Two just because you are paying someone $20 that doesn't mean they will be as productive as 3 at $12. To put it one way, that is like saying someone in California (where minimum wage will hit $15 soon and that lots making $20 as well) will be more productive than someone in say Ohio with a lower minimum wage. I know the topic isn't about minimum wage, but its the best way I could describe my point.
