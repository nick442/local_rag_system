Which was why I gave the example of the PA recognized waiver for leases. PA landlord/tenant law requires 10 day notice to be given to the tenant prior to filing a court action. PA courts have recognized, for decades, that this right can be waived. Waiving your right to notice has been one of the standard clauses in PA leases for well over 3 decades.
