That's the point. They're crooks who only want to do an IPO at the moment they start filing publicly. If you did an IPO after financials are already public, then you'd be forced to sell at a fair price. Doing it before an actual earnings report (which is more accurate than an S-1) allows them to exploit speculation and get a better price.
