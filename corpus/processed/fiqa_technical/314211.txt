"Darling, I was an adjunct professor in a university. With ""no child left behind"", people who can barely read finish high school and I, as a professor in the university, was told I cannot fail anyone of them in my classes. High school requirements and even Bachelor degrees became a joke and totally worthless degrees. And the more people get ""bachelor degree"" the less benefit and value those degrees will have. **Not long time ago, to be a teller in Bank, you did not need to finish high school. Just be good with basic math and organized. Today, you need a bachelor degree. Why? Why not? Too many people with worthless degrees, so why not require it as part of the job?**"
