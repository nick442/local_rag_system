> Mr. Musk should have known in August, when production guidance was reiterated, that the company wasnâ€™t going to produce 1,500 Model 3s by the end of September. ..and what about those 400,000+ deposits on the Model 3? Does anyone think all those people are going to wait five or six years for their cars? EDIT: There's always the issue of Musk's [pronouncements in the past](http://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/753sda/youtube_may_not_be_responsive_to_complaints_about/) that could be interpreted as defense-in-advance.
