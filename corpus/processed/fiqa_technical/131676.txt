You might be better off soliciting software engineers on AngelList. Coder and programmer is a bit derogatory also -- you are seeking an Engineer. With that said, I've been approached numerous times for things like this and the answer is always no. You are basically looking for a cofounder so be prepared to give away 50%. You need seed capital, and you don't really need an engineer for that so you should formalize the business plan and get funding. If you can't convince someone for 50 or 100k of seed then the idea is probably flat and you won't find an engineer who wants to touch it.
