"I agree a disciplined environment is key to knowledge getting deeply implanted. I remember at my university there were some great professors. About 10% to 20% were not very good at all and a video online of a great professor would have been much better. I suspect there's some analogy from the field of entertainment that will play out here. When movies got sound you had the best entertainers in the world available for everyone albeit in a more limited capacity than live. So a great performer on screen is more appealing than some percent of the lowest group. This technology killed Vaudeville but I doubt it will kill off the entire university system like it killed Vaudeville. I suspect the lowest performers will be out the door and the hippie professor types that don't provide motivation and structure will be out. I wonder if we'll have professor ""stars"" like we had movie stars and now have celebrity chefs and preachers."
