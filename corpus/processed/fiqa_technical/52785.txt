It's not that they don't want to pay it, it is that there is now an economic incentive to do it. People can no longer be turned down because of a preexisting condition. That means that I should wait until I break my arm to sign up for insurance. Then once it's better I should cancel it again. That is simply what makes sense economically. Only people who are sick need insurance if sick people cannot be turned down
