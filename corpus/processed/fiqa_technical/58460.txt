"tl;dr: Sears is failing because the CEO is running the company into the ground for personal profit. There have been many, many articles written on the issue. The CEO is having the stores sell their property, at a discount, to one of his other companies, then having the stores pay rent. Except boutique stores actually pay more money than Sears does. So whenever a store closes, his other company can rent the space out for almost double. Oh, and he encouraged a corporate culture where the department heads use those screen protectors hospitals use to keep each other from spying on their laptops during meetings. The way IT works, some departments actually contract out to a 3rd party rather than going through corporate, since it's cheaper. Yes, departments individually have an IT budget, and are required to have their own ""Contract"" to use in house IT. It's so bad that, many employees say they are explicitly barred from helping another department. So, customers feel snubbed and end up balking because there's no one to help them, or to run the register. That's the power of a bad CEO that the board refuses to fire."
