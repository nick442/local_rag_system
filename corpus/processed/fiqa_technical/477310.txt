"No, I understood your question perfectly. I'm just saying that sort of situation is generally rare. A quick Google search yields [this article] (http://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/1112/small-business-financing-debt-or-equity.aspx) which responds to the question - Which funding method should I choose? with the answer ""Often you will not have a choice"". That is exactly what I'm saying. The status and stage of your business dictates what sort of financing is even available to you. Most often you don't even have a choice between one or the other. If you want a formula, the other people responding mentioned [WACC] (http://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wacc.asp) which is the ""standard"" that finance professionals typically use. You generally will want a WACC that is similar to other successful companies of your similar size and industry. The actual mechanics of adjusting your WACC will involve either issuing (or repurchasing) equity or debt. Regardless, what you are asking is not generally practical nor does it come into practice in 99 out of 100 financing situations. WACC is important to understand and consider but people don't issue equity or debt just to balance their WACC. Think about this another way.. how easy is it to raise debt? Probably fairly easy as usually you can go to commercial banks or go to an investment bank if you're raising enough debt. Companies borrow all of the time, they're constantly paying off loans or taking new ones with different interest rates. There are revolving lines of credit, secured loans, factoring (borrowing against receivables), EETCs, fixed interest debt, variable interest debt, mezzanine debt, etc etc. How easy is it to issue equity? Pretty amazingly difficult.. sure you have your IPOs but that happens once in a company's lifetime. You might have [secondary offerings] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_market_offering) or [follow ons] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Follow-on_offering) but those are incredibly rare.. I mean you've probably never even heard of them right? You don't hear about Apple or Boeing doing those every quarter do you? You'll hear about private equity companies buying up firms and you'll hear about mergers all of the time but again those are once-in-a-company's-lifetime events. So now that you've read that. how often is a company **really** going to be deciding between debt and equity? Not very often."
