Assuming you mean that seriously, millimeter wave machines don't expose you to radiation, and backscatter x-ray machines expose you to as much radiation as you experience in about 9 minutes of daily life at sea level (and far less than you get exposed to in flight due to altitude). Also, use of scanners isn't limited to the TSA or the USA.
