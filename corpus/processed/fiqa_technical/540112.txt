Not zealous, I just was quickly glancing while taking my morning shit. But I do very much like the company, and enjoy working for them. I'm treated well, the culture is great, and for the customers that are right for best buy, we are great. I spent 12 years before working here in IT. The only time I bought stuff from best buy was because I needed it right then, so I'm with you. But you are generally not our demographic.(I can't imagine corporate thinks you are, I'm just a store level employee, not representing the company)
