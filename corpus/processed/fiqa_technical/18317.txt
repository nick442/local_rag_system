Bad bad analogies. No offense sorry, I make bad analogies too. Tinkering with income inequality will not get in the way of overall wealth creation. Go check out the income gap of the US vs any other industrialized nation. Many have lower debt and lower unemployment than we do now, and have a lower income gap, which is caused by laws set up by society, not by some magical force. People think it is just natural that some countries have a higher income gap than others. It actually is NOT fact that increasing everyone's wealth helps society more. if you look up any study done that measures happiness in a society, it shows many countries have happier people than the US does. The US has more crime, mental illness, etc. than any other industrialized country. if wealth creation were the solution to our problems, why isn't the US even keeping up with other countries when it comes to measurements that involve a society's success? The key is that wealth creation only helps a society to a certain point, beyond that it doesn't make people happier. When you said 'helps society more', you obviously meant people in it being happy, right? having iPhones doesn't 'help society more' if everyone is miserable. Anyway, once you get to where basic needs are met, more wealth doesn't really make people any happier. But there is a mountain of evidence that a high income gap makes people miserable.
