"The full holdings will be listed in the annual report of the fund, obviously the holdings would only be completely accurate as of the date of the reporting. This is the most recent annual report for FMAGX. I got it from my Schwab research section under ""All Fund Documents"" but I'm sure you can find it other ways. When I use google to search for ""fmagx annual report"" this link was the first result."
