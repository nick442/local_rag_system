What nonsense. You're in effect saying that companies that might face negative npv project should simply 'look harder'. Hell no, as a shareholder I demand they have a fiduciary role. If buybacks are excessive due to CEO incentives to the expense of worthwhile project, that's a different problem and always leave me to vote with my departure as a shareholder.
