> Prices can still be low and people can still make tons of money, just slightly less money for those at the top and slightly more for those at the bottom rungs. You cannot simply *pay* people a wage different to market wage. Why would the executives take accept a salary at 80% of the market wage when they could just get a job at 100% of the market wage? And at the other end, if you simply started paying the workers 20% more, suddenly all of the workers at that new price point want to get a job at Wal-Mart. They swiftly will replace all the current employees, who cannot perform at that level. If they *could*, why would they have been working at Wal-Mart? You are railing against reality. Yes, it sucks that some people are only capable of labour at low productivity levels. Totally agree. Simply trying to *pretend* that they are *more* productive is just ridiculous, though.
