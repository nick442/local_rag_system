I view it as a “zero sum game” from the perspective of the customer. Don’t tell me that my meal is $25 when EVERYONE KNOWS that it’s actually, $25 + $5 tip = $30. Just make the menu price $30 and pay people properly. It’s the exact same cost for a customer. Then, if a tip is left, it is truly a tip for the worker(s) and not the majority of their earnings. And before anyone chimes in to tell me that servers like to tax-dodge on their unreported earnings.. Yeah, so would we all. In the same way that we’d never pay a Doctor, Accountant, Soldier, or Teacher a fraction of their pay and then hope that the people they serve were in a good mood to give them a little something extra, neither should we do this to tipped workers.
