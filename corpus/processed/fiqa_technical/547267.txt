Given the combination of the admitted delays and then the failure of the money to arrive with only their word they have sent it, I would be worried that the solicitor is having financial problems and has not really sent your money because they don't have it. This shouldn't be possible unless they were already acting unethically by not properly segregating client money, but that possibility does always exist. I would consult the Solicitor's Regulation Authority for advice as quickly as possible. They may not be the right people to initially deal with the problem, but they should be able to advise on the appropriate next steps and it might help them match up your problem with any other reports they have received.
