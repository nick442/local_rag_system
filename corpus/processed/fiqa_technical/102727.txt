Bank of America NA had over $101 billion in revenue 2013. A $16 billion fine represents 15.7% of BOA's annual revenue. The median family income in the US is $53,046. 15.7% of that is $8,346. If I spent more than a decade defrauding individuals, businesses, government agencies and investors and wound up having to pay an $8 thousand dollar fine and not serve a single day in jail .. I would be planning a long and prosperous criminal career for the next decade.
