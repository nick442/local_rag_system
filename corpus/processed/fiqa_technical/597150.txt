I know what your saying. But I think there is a bit of hopes and feels in stocks also. If people feel like it's going to go down they sale. Causing it to go down right? Bad news article comes out about a stock or bitcoin. They go down. Good news article comes out they both go up. Even if the company changed nothing. Bit of hopes and feels involved. Edit: pose that as a question. Am I completely off the mark here?
