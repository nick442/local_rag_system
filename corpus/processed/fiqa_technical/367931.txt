If you bought a Barbi doll for a 6 year old boy who obviously doesn't want it and won't play with it, would you say the toy is bad? That same toy would be perfect for many 6 year old girls. School being paid for and given to kids that don't want it doesn't mean it's a bad system, just that some have no interest in using it.
