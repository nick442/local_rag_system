Bull fucking shit. My sister was shot in the neck in fells point. Look at the fucking crime statistics. It has nothing to do with the wire. I lived in Baltimore for 29 years before moving to Boston. It's night and day. You're blaming my 29 years of personal experience on a fucking television show? Go to hell.
