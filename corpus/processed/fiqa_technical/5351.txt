I actually completely agree that global warming is increasing foliage, because plants thrive in a high CO2 environment. But I disagree that this is good for the environment as a whole. I looked at your history and can see I probably wont be able to change your mind. But just imagine that you're wrong for a second and that you are supporting something that will be horrible for your grandchildren.
