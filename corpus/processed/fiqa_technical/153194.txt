Honestly, mostly basic arithmetic and algebra on a daily basis. The person who builds the models at my firm is a plasma physics phd though. I suspect most physicists are brought into firms in this capacity. I plug my assumptions into the model and then intellectualize and sell the results. Nothing of what we do, as they say, is rocket science.
