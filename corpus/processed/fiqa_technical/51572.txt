>According to something I read geography doesn't matter. Basically you could be the King of South Dakota with a $75k family income, that's property on a lake, a boat, horses, and all kinds of cool stuff. In a nice city $75k wouldn't get you as much stuff, but you'd have more people around you and more amenities. (Looking, but I can't find the source at the moment) That's a preferences difference. Some people like nature and would take South Dakota. Some of us like cities, and would take Cambridge, MA.
