"I've been a member for over 15 years and do most of my shopping there. But it isn't a myth. While some items are singles/normal such as clothing, many are larger/bulk. The price per unit is a heck of a lot lower as a result, but the price is still higher. For example ketchup is a 1.25kg two pack while my local supermarket sells them as smaller singles. Toilet paper is twice the price of a local Target but you get almost 4 times as much. Bacon comes as a two pack of a pound each (one pack at supermarket). Milk comes as two one gallon containers. Fruit and vegetables come in containers that are typically twice the size of my local supermarket. Bleach comes in a huge box containing 3 large containers. Shrimp comes in a two pound bag - local supermarket is 1lb pound bags at their largest. Halloween candy comes in huge bags - the local supermarket has some that big, but the vast majority are a lot smaller. Bread is in two packs - local supermarket is a one pack. The rotisserie chicken is a single just like my local supermarket and is cheaper. Costco is undoubtedly value for money, but a typical family shopping list will cost more upfront (and then last longer). But not everyone can afford the membership and higher initial ""investment""."
