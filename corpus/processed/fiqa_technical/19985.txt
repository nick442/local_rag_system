"I hate when people say this type of thing. Someone spending $20k on an event is using their residual income, and can most definitely also afford to go on vacations. It's like saying ""I'd never buy a Lamborghini, I'd buy a house instead"". That's nice wishful thinking, but the dude getting a Lambo isn't going to have an issue having a house."
