Samsung is working on it. But I agree 100%. Rim is working on clients for iPhone and Android. They can't get that shit out soon enough. Also, this is why I firmly believe that RIM's best chance is to split their software and hardware devisions. Let each succeed on it's own merits and allow the 2 companies to focus properly on the product they produce.
