I would respectfully disagree. They have chosen to invest in commodities that provide no return (Gold, Rare Earth Metals) over derivatives that lose money. I believe the following explains some of their logic. http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-10-05/jpmorgan-loss-proves-system-too-complex-china-s-gao-says They take issue with the basis of the Western financial system, and while Gao claims he is speaking about his personal beliefs, his observations are quite accurate. Most of the transactions in the financial system add very little value, while commissions and fees are taken from every transaction. This is one of the core issues that isn't talked about, but is a very real cause of trade disputes between the US and China. (And arguably all of the BRICS nations) A simple example of what I mean is when BoA slapped monthly debit fees on everyone's account. Thanks, but what did that really do for their customers? Another attempt to 'pick' the customers pocket.
