In [We Are Market Basket](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TRF2LLK/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1), a corn supplier says they had to sell their product to Whole Foods that summer. Whole Foods paid them less for their product than a discount grocery store. The other side of that is that the corn Whole Foods was selling was the same corn carried at a discount grocery store. Whole Food produce might be better than some other stores, but it isn't necessarily better (or even different) from what is carried at other stores.
