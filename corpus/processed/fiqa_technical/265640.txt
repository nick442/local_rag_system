"I can't speak for every credit card, but I know two of mine don't have overage fees. The transaction either goes through, or gets denied. Check your card agreement and look for the fee section. One other thing to consider, sometimes when you make an online payment to a credit card, you will notice that the ""Available Balance"" number on the account will increase right away even if the payment is not reflected on your ""Current Balance"". If this is the case, and you are positive that your payment will be successfully posted to the account, I say go for it."
