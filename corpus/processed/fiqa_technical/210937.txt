That depends where you put the top bracket, but probably there is little way to jack income tax to anywhere near that without serious detrimental effect to the economy. The real issue is not that the wealthiest earn too much but that they have too much. There is a huge glut of massive savings at the top that is continually growing and taking money from the economy. This savings drives the creation of public debt more than any other factor. It is that which needs to be, at least in the near term, taxed aggressively.
