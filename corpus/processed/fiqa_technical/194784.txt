Having people that work directly with the software/hardware or those who actually created it provide support is an amazing thing. It's more expensive than hiring people to read a script, but the quality of support will be very high and if there is an issue with the program it's going to get fixed so they get fewer support calls. Support should be about fixing the problem as correctly as possible. That may not make sense, but think of it like this. Every day somebody calls in to complain how a program keeps losing it's settings, the person on the other end explains how to export and import the settings so if it happens again they can get back to where they were. They could just keep telling people how to import their settings, or they could develop a fix for it and never have any calls about this issue again. Both fix the issue (in my mind the first one does not really), but the 2nd one is the correct fix, making it work every time and reducing support costs.
