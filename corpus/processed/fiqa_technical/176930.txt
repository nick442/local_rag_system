>Not sad but evil. Who am I to assign a dollar value to your life, your hopes, your dreams, your happiness? Who is anyone else? Yes, you are right, to a point. Thinking of everyone in terms of their utility can lead to extreme evil. I am responsible not only for those around me but also to my future generation. It is my responsibility that the future generation finds the world a bit better than it was when I came in existence. The world does not exist for me but I exist for the world. Like everything in the world, there is an upper bound to the value added by every organism, including myself. We can ignore it, similar to how climate deniers ignore global warming, fundamentalists ignore evolution and other fundamentalists deny the holocaust but that does not mean it is not reality. Even if I am not a utilitarian, I am still a person for whom the future is as important as the past and the present and it is my duty to think of them and to do what I believe is right for them. I will be right sometimes and wrong in other instances but it is my responsibility to try. For me, it is evil to not think of making life better for my children, just because I was scared of being called evil and closed my eyes. Finally, I leave you with this - http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203918304577243321242833962.html
