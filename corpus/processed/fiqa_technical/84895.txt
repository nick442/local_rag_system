Silly me for assuming you would actually read it >> Although death rates for many individual cancer types have also declined, **rates for a few cancers have stabilized or even increased.** >> **As the overall cancer death rate has declined, the number of cancer survivors has increased** >>**Although rates of smoking, a major cause of cancer, have declined, the U.S. population is aging, and cancer rates increase with age. Obesity, another risk factor for cancer, is also increasing.**
