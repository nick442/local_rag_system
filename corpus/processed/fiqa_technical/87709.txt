Bezos is not a Billionaire because of WaPo, and neither Carlos Slim from Mexico is a Billionaire from owning NYT. Bezos is reach from Amazon, and he acquired the failing WaPo to advance his political agenda while writing off all the loses from WaPo to reduce his tax bill. Same with Carlos: he makes money from Telecom in Mexico and he NYT is just for political reasons and tax saving.
