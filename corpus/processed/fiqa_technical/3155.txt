> I don't have any data for this, but I believe online sales would increase as brand awareness increases. There are also benefits where you can buy online and have it delivered, but return in person. Right, right..I wonder if it's beneficial sometimes to have a physical location because the consumer is less likely to make the purchase if they have to go through the process of shipping it back. Would be very interesting to see if after X amount of time if a brand is still as prominent online as it was in Y location after it left physically, or does leaving physically cause a degradation in brand awareness and thusforth sales. >Probably low rents. Commercial real estate is a difficult business. Hot locations are always rented. Bad locations will do anything to keep their tenants. Figured. I wonder how common re-negotiations are. >I have never seen either of those items be accepted for return.. They do, and then they are damaged out. Perhaps this is part the answer, in order to have a lenient return policy physical locations are part of the equation to decrease loss.
