Agreed. Also, I think something missing here is the perception that companies are profiting enough to warrant these salary increases. The current competitive landscape in America is tough. Aside from a premier selection of companies, most are getting by and do not have the means to raise wages in the ways suggested. These companies could raise their prices, and that's been happening and will probably continue, but it's mostly going to affect the same people that it's serving to increase wages for. The real issue as I see it is that there isn't enough capital in circulation. Americans aren't spending and massive capital reserves sit with the 1% that are gun shy on investing, understandably so.
