The gold standard didn't work because of the following process: * Start with 10oz of Gold. * Deposit in Bank A * Bank lends out 9 oz of Gold Certificates * Gold certificates deposited in Bank B * Bank B lends out 8oz of Gold Certificates * etc. Now at the end of all this we have a lot of gold certificates. This is called the [Money Multiplier](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_multiplier) effect. What if someone wants to take their gold certificates and buy a boat made in Europe? Well. If they spend 5 gold certificates on that boat then the certificates land in the European bank who requests gold to be shipped from America to pay for it. Suddenly America's bank reserves collapse and there is a very sharp credit contraction as all the banks stop lending because they are out of reserves that back their gold certificates. If the person had actual coins he was using to buy the boat, only his consumption would be reduced and it wouldn't cause damage throughout the whole financial system. So basically wherever you have fractional reserve banking, gold backed monetary systems will fail. Anywhere you criticize fractional reserve banking your theory will be basically ignored because criticizing banking gets you nowhere in economics career-wise. Praising derivatives and all sorts of hair-brained financial innovations will win you awards and prizes and guest appearances on CNBC though.
