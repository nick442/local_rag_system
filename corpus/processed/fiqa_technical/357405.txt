And I hope those minimum wage workers get their asses kicked for being scabs. Crossing a picket line is VERY dangerous. Any idiot to do that to get a minimum wage job is just acting stupid. Here in Vancouver when our garbage men went on strike, a few souls were driving around collecting garbage for charity. one day one of them got a call to go to a house, where a few large guys with baseball bats came out. Needless to say he stopped.
