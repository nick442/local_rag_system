It was Facebook/Zuckerberg implementing their black mail engine. I helped manage a Facebook page as an intern for a mid-size music venue a few years ago. Our outreach per post was hitting at least 50% of our followers. Overnight that number crashed to 15-20%. Conveniently. we received an email shortly thereafter explaining how if we paid for advertising, we could boost our visibility back to where it used to be. That cannot be a winning strategy in the longterm, to demand that the entities that drive traffic on your site to pay for exposure.
