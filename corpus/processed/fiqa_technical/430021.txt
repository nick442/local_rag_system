Yeah, with the exception of current-season shows from HBO and Showtime, pretty much everything is on iTunes and Amazon and you can pay by the episode, so you don't have to commit to a whole season or large package that you may end up not wanting. Your honesty is appreciated. You get what you pay for, right? Netflix has a lot of great library content, but not the latest and greatest. Price: $8/month.
