"I find the breathless optimism a bit much. It's not as though there's been some big breakthrough in the field that's brought the quantum computing future much closer. But admittedly, the author did include some caveats about how it all might ultimately not work as predicted. Also, I don't believe that quantum research is telling us anything new about whether ""the laws of logic .. apply to the universe as a whole .. computations it can’t perform? Paradoxes it can’t escape?"" I suppose it *could* tell us something new, but that remains to be seen, as does whether it's an economically viable approach to computing."
