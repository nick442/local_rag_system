"I'm in this situation right now. I've increased my annual pay by 20% due to overtime but the extra work is killing me. I finally went to my boss and said that if they weren't going to hire more people, the least they could do is replace the deadweight employees with ones who are actually capable of doing some work. We have a lot of ""lifers"" with my company who were hired 20 years ago to do some simple task that has now been eliminated so they were shuffled into a different position that they just aren't qualified for and none of them are willing to put in the effort to update their skills. If my coworkers had to interview for the positions they currently hold, about half of them would not be hired. But since they're already here and the company is scared to fire people for being incompetent, we're stuck with them."
