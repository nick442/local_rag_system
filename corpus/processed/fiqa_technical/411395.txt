We buy groceries online, because we live in an apartment, and lifting 5kg bags of rice and potatoes, 2L bottles of milk, juice, and cooking oil, and 2 jumbo boxes of nappies is physically impossible. Even if we had a car, getting these from the carpark up to the apartment would still be a major hassle. We do still buy fresh produce in person though, because firstly, as you said, we know our preferences better, and secondly, fruits are charged per each for online orders, and fresh vegetables are not sold online.
