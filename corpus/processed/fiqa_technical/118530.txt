"Where are you getting the idea that I think there is any altruism whatsoever in what Whole Foods does? You are missing the point entirely. Let me make it perfectly clear: They are selling me **what** I, personally, want, and selling it to me in the **way** I, personally, want it. Every single grocery store is ""consumerist."" I've been shopping at Whole Foods for (almost) 30 years, and the reason is because Whole Foods has put its research into discovering what and how to serve me, and then delivering. The experience of shopping in a Safeway, Albertson's or the like is ugly, uncomfortable, cold and smelly. They are too big and take forever to get from one item I want to another. They are filled with junk they are trying to trick me into thinking is nutritious. What makes you think Whole Foods is in any way MORE deceptive than Walmart, Publix, Costco, etc? Because they responded to a market that wanted **quality** food that could be traced back to it's source? Why wouldn't they respond to that? It is a myth that WF is selling only ""luxury food and drink"" items. I can go into a WF and see local produce. What is so extravagant about that? >do you ever wonder if maybe that passion is appealed to and marketer towards by businesses I'm *thrilled* that it is. That means I can access food that I want and enjoy, and it costs less than it would otherwise. I can buy sugar-free bacon at Whole Foods. YAY! I feel great about that. I can't get that at Safeway. Do you think commercial food producers and other grocery outlets don't collectively FAR outspend Whole Foods to promote less nutritious food that is as inexpensive as possible to produce? That they don't sacrifice quality for profits? Where do you live that commercial grocery chains are somehow operating from the goodness of **their** hearts? Tell yourself whatever you want -- but if you have the impression that WF has somehow fooling me, thanks for your concern, but I'm good. I LOVE that they figured out what I want to eat and how I want to shop for it."
