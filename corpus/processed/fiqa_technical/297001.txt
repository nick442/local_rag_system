I get so pissed off at the concept of being forced to use services I have no interest in supporting, e.g. traditional taxi cabs. I live and work in Detroit. There is a pretty big difference in quality between an Uber driver and a Yellow Taxi driver. Thanks businessmen at large for controlling my choices for me. sorry!
