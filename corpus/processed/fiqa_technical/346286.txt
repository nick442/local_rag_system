We might not find it immediately worth it, but the market for such high labor only exists because we give it that market. On the surface, we all claim we would rather work half as much if it means not advancing any further. Yet we all throw money at the economy in a way that makes it want to keep working us to death to innovate. You ever wonder why you have to work so much, it's because this much labor is needed to sustain the demands of the people who want more production, more advancement, more things created. When you buy an iPhone X, you are telling Apple that you want them to continue hiring more people to work long hours to create better and nicer phones. When you pay more money for nicer houses instead of average houses you are telling construction companies to get more hours of labor from their workers to build you nicer things. When you buy the newest model of a car, you are telling those car companies that you want them to keep innovating and building new shit instead of halving their worker hours and making the same old cars with the same old factories. Who is it really that is demanding all this production and labor? It's us. We are the ones that make it impossible to work 2-3 days a week and be okay, because we've convinced ourselves that we have to keep pushing forward.
