It would also attract tons of costumers who aren't necessarily vegan, but are interested in trying vegan food. I see many more people trying vegan food as a healthy choice, rather than a moral choice. I think (hope) the 1st world will soon wake up to the devastating effects our food system is having on personal health. With how many adults are overweight and obese, I think it sounds like a fantastic idea to try and make healthy foods more accessible. All the better if they can make those healthy foods taste like my favorite animal proteins. I'd be very interested in trying it, especially if it's fast food. When I go out to a restaurant I want to get something I know I'll enjoy. If I'm just going through a drive through I'd be more likely to just give vegan food a quick try.
