Then the Brick and mortar stores will just switch to delivery. Walmart could deliver pretty much anything to you in 15 minutes, as well as CVS or Walgreens and a few other stores. They don't though because it is much more profitable to have you come into the store and buy some shit you don't need. If it ever reaches a tipping point where online is really taking away that much then they will easily change. The going into a store and shopping isn't going anywhere though because there is certain brain chemistry at play that gets you to spend more money and enjoy it more not just because of getting the item sooner, but the inspection process etc. What's probably more likely is that you will end up going into small local, very close to you demo stores, and checking out the items, deciding what you want, using your smartphone to build a cart. Going through a cart confirmation and then the items will be delivered to your home in ~20 minutes or so, there will also be things you can buy directly at the demo store and take home such as new items that are being promoted. You may even be able to select items at home that you want to checkout and have that bundled with your delivery from the demo store.
