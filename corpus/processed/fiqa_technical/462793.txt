IMO would have been a solid idea 10-20 years ago, but I'm not sure how they are going to monetize it. I think it's a great value add for the mall, but I can't see users paying each time they use it or for an allotted time. I think the only way it would be successful for the company who makes/operates the booths is if the mall is paying them a fee for having them in their mall, but offer it as a free service for their attendees. With the number of people physically going to malls decreasing due to online retailers, I don't see this as a forward thinking idea. My view is limited though. I can't say I know shopping habits or trends in China.
