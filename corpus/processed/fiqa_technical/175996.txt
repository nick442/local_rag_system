HARP is the Home Affordable Refinance Program. Announced in March 2009, HARP is a federally funded government program designed to help the 5 million homeowners who currently owe more on their mortgage then their home is currently worth, otherwise known as being underwater or near-underwater, refinance their mortgages into a fixed loan with a lower monthly payment. However, as of Aug. 31, only 894,000 borrowers have refinanced through HARP.
