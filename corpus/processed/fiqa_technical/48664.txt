Your first question:Does the successor have to pay taxes for the full amount of the inherited TFSA? No, there is no taxes to pay, in most TFSA situations, there is no tax payable. If it was a beneficiary instead of a successor, there would be taxes on revenues generated only, but this is not your case. Your second question: The TFSA of the deceased holder will still increase the contribution room over the years? No, the contribution applies only to the one person alive. Whether he, or she, has one or two TFSA is irrelevant to the contribution limit. Successor holder, Contribution limit.
