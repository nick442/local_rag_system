"If you're going into a field that is both in demand and pays well, then yes, it's worth going into debt for college. That said, it's also usually worth *minimizing* how much debt you take on. Unless you're going into a field where ""Harvard"" is all but a requirement to get your foot in the door, there's virtually no difference between *that* and your local state university, 99% of the time. If, however, you have no idea what you want to do and are going to college just because everyone says you should - Then no, you *shouldn't*, unless someone else is paying for it (and even then, don't arbitrarily put your parents in the poorhouse just because they'll sign on the bottom line)."
