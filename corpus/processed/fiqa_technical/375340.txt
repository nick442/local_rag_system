Epistemology is not an alternative to empiricism, it's the field to which it belongs. Empiricism is the basis of science, and the alternative to rationalism. This distinction is very old, and remains an open question. If you're not going to actually take the time to read my arguments, and consider them honestly why bother responding? This dialogue has ceased to be enjoyable. Good day.
