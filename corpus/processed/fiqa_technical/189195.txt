I didn’t say everything is ok, I said things are improving. I also have been speaking generally about the world in the entirety of this comment thread, but you’ve apparently decided that only Americans in poverty matter. I view that as myopic and selfish, but hell let’s go with that for a second. Regarding specifically the US - it turns out poverty is decreasing here as well: http://www.povertyusa.org/the-state-of-poverty/poverty-facts/ Also by your own definition, no one in the middle class is in poverty. The census bureau says 43 million people in the us live in poverty. This is way too many, but it is less than 25%. It’s closer to 12%. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty_in_the_United_States So once again, I’ve shown how nothing you say has any basis in reality. I’ve also never said everything is fine, I’ve only said it’s improving systematically. What I say is true and based in fact. What you say is based on your feelings and categorically not true by any measure, and can’t even be saved by your fluid redefinition of terms. Please understand that things aren’t perfect and the world isn’t fair, but poverty in the US and elsewhere are improving. Feelings can’t change facts, and you’re feelings simply don’t line up with the facts.
