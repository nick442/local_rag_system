This. Best Buy doesn't sell cases of water..they are shrinkwrapped like this from the Coke distributor and meant to go in coolers by the registers and such. There was no price gouging here..hell, the price of the products might not even be set by Best Buy (they likely get a cut from Coca cola when they are actually sold). But..they shouldn't have ended up on the floor like this in the first place, it just looks bad.
