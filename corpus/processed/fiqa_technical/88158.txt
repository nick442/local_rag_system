"I learned just how stupid and useless Gartner Magic Quadrants were many years ago when I was working at a public utility that was trying to use one to determine ""which web server to use."" (I kid you not) I had one look at the thing and immediately noticed what *wasn't* there: Apache. This was about 10 years ago when Apache owned like 75% of all websites on the internet (before Microsoft bribed various DNS parking sites)."
