"I suppose I should update this with what I ended up using some of my HSA funds for.. dental work! I'm in my mid-20's and it came time for my wisdom teeth to be removed. While my dental insurance covered the procedure, I had to pay out of pocket for the fancy ""conscious sedation"" ($325 to make me nice and relaxed, versus plain Novocaine and nervously holding my mouth open, while I get my teeth ripped out). Luckily, I had my HSA to cover it. Also, I may need braces.. :\ Most dental insurance won't cover the cost of orthodontics 100%, so that's another costly, common, and easily-overlooked expense a younger person may have that spare HSA funds can cover."
