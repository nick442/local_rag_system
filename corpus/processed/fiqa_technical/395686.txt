I think you're misunderstanding how tax brackets work. If you make $1 more and that bumps you into a higher bracket, only THAT particular dollar will be taxed at the higher tax bracket rate.. Not your entire income. Short term capital gains are treated as income. Long term capital gains have a special tax rate currently.
