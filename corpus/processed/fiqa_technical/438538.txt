I think that's part of the problem - no one was aware that it was that fast. Additionally, we live in a world where we want guarantees and people are willing to pay dearly for it. FedEx will charge 20x and you know it will be delivered the next day. The USPS won't make the same guarantee though that's probably the case 95% of the time. It's a little sad, really, that they've been allowed to suffer so long while the threats to their business have been obvious. It borders on incompetency and mismanagement.
