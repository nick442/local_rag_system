>The medallion owner typically buys a vehicle and leases it to a driver.. That means the medallion owner has to make back his [$1m for a medallion] investment, along with maintaining and insuring the vehicle. Which he does willingly because taxis are an *extremely* profitable business. If he wasn't making money, he wouldn't buy the damned medallion at that price
