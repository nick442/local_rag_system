You have a point with suicide, however, even the smallest estimates of defensive gun use show it is more common than gun homicides. In regards to suicide, we need to examine WHY people are committing suicide and work to resolve the root causes. Likely ending the drug war (less people in prison, less people with felony records), better access to healthcare, and more assistance for the poor will help greatly at killing the root causes of why people want to commit suicide.
