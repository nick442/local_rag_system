Just look at GNP for manufacturing, and then compare population sizes. If you've got 4x the people and you're only producing slightly more than another country in finished goods, what does that say about your manufacturing sector? Is it a world beater, or an also ran? Also, of course, most of the margin for those products is realized post manufacture. Selling shit to consumers is hard. Also consider things like this: >This is partly because a large share of Chinese production costs consists of imports from other countries. Xing and Detert (2010) demonstrate this by examining the production costs of an iPhone. In 2009, it cost about $179 in China to produce an iPhone, which sold in the United States for about $500. Thus, $179 of the U.S. retail cost consisted of Chinese imported content. However, only **$6.50** was actually due to assembly costs in China. The other $172.50 reflected costs of parts produced in other countries, including **$10.75** for parts made in the United States. http://www.frbsf.org/publications/economics/letter/2011/el2011-25.html The US adds more value to the manufacturing process of an iPhone (forgetting design entirely) than the country that ends up with the credit for its manufacture.
