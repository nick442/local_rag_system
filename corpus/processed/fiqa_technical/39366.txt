Good on 'em! I recently swapped out my old Galaxy S5 for a new LG, and I have to say that the Galaxy's reputation as an industry leader is well-deserved. The LG does a lot of things better than my old Galaxy, but it has many more design flaws and stupid bullshits and in general, I preferred the Galaxy, me not being much of a technophile.
