It's just odd to me these pieces that try to talk up the economy never mention the Fed has $5 trillion in Tbills and Mortgage Backed Securities and still climbing fast. Even if the economy was great now, what do you think happens when they stop buying these bonds? And what if they don't? If the FED has $15 trillion, is that too much? You people never take a stand on either of those two. Edit: spelling
