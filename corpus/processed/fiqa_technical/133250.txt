My in-laws don't cook and thought this shit was revolutionary or something so they keep giving us subscriptions as presents. It's expensive, basically you get raw ingredients and simple instructions for preparing nice meals that take an hour of your life (they estimate less it's always longer in reality), 100 steps to make and have no leftovers. You still have to chop the stuff up and their recipe's usually take 5+ pans and pots minimum to prepare, so you end up with a lot of dirty dishes and no leftovers for all your trouble since the portions are small. Basically you're better off going to the store and learning how to cook from any of the bazillion recipes online, which I assume most customers end up doing. We grew to dread getting a box when it'd show up. Can't say the meals weren't good just not saving you anything over doing it yourself.
