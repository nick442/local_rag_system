Thank you for stating this point. Food prices in the U.S. are stable and reasonable. The economic downfall was not tied to agriculture. Why would we mess with something that is functional right as we are starting to show signs of a healthy economy again. Now I am not supporting Monsanto but with the current state of the economy we shouldn't mess to much with things that are working.
