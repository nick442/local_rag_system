"My experiment has concluded, with the same exact result that Aganju told me to expect. Just pulled Equifax report on CreditKarma, and confirmed that my bank reported the balance as $0. I expect that TransUnion will be the same; I'll update if it's different (evidently TU is still behind on the updates from my bank; I'll check again next week.) Regarding my score: I went from 1.333% card utilization to 0%, but my ""VantageScore 3.0"" did not change at all; not even by one point."
