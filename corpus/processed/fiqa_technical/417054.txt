What I am saying is that social contract, despite the words chosen and combined in order to label the concept, is not a literal contract or agreement. How is it not common sense that individuals have to make some sacrifices for the good of their community/state/republic? If you think that a nation can function on the level that US does without majority of its citizens paying their taxes, I don't know what alternative you are offering for paying the costs of running a country.
