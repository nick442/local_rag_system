That there are more jobs today isn't a convincing argument. There are more people to feed, more services to provide etc. I worry that large scale automation, particularly in industries with high employment numbers could be disruptive to the economy in general. As new technologies emerge and demand continues to pace population growth, additional workers will always be needed. The question is, what happens when the majority of those jobs are taken by robots, not people.
