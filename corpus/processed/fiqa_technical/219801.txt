I watched the video, it is really very basic, but it does back up my assertion. The banks have a gain because they are the money creators, they don't see a gain from the Cantillion Effect because they are lending money and not buying goods (unless we're talking about investment banking, which we are not). The other people it listed in the pyramid are the ones who gain.
