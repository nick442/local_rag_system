First off, I would question why do you need a LI policy? While you may be single are you supporting anyone? If not, and you have some money saved to cover a funeral; or, your next of kin would be able to pay for final expenses then you probably don't have a need. In, general, LI is a bad investment vehicle. I do not know hardly anything about the Indian personal finance picture, but here in the US, agents tout LI as a wonderful investment. This can be translated as they make large commissions on such products. Here in the US one is far better off buying a term product, and investing money elsewhere. I image it is similar in India. Next time if you want to help a friend, listen to his sales presentation, give some feedback, and hand him some cash. It is a lot cheaper in the long run.
