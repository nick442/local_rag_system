Why do savings accounts for businesses offer less yield than bank accounts for individuals? The money held in savings account on a collective average substantial amount stays with the Bank. The Bank is better able to predict and thus invest this money in individual savings account in market to make more money. Money held in Business accounts are unpredictable and can get withdrawn, the Bank is thus not able to predict the behaviour and hence not able to invest this better to get good returns, hence the interest offered is low. Most Banks have special products for Businesses that would give better return but come with some kind of lock-in or minimum balances.
