"I would start by taking it to your bank and asking them what they think. They can probably call the bank on the check and find out if it is still good. If they let you deposit the check, I would wait a couple of weeks before spending the money, in case the issuing bank decides that the check is no good, and your bank wants its money back. If you are told that the check is not good anymore, the next thing I would do is to check with your state's treasurer's office and see if they have any ""unclaimed money"" for your mother."
