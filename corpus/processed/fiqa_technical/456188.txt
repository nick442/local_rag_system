"No, but you can better see who is making that profit possible. I've worked for companies where some divisions were making a profit according to their books. But when you take into account the resources they were consuming, especially IT, they were really operating at a loss. In the case of IT I don't think its beneficial to ""make a profit"", but they should at least charge the other departments their cost just so you can see how those other departments are impacting the company as a whole."
