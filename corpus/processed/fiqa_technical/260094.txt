So Betas are not found on a company's financial statements. Beta is essentially a measure of the covariance of an asset and the overall market return, in relation to the variance of the market's return. A beta of 1 is to describe an asset whose daily returns mimic the returns of the overall market. A beta of >1 describes an asset whose returns are greater than the market return and a beta <1 describes an asset whose returns are less than the market return. To the extent that the asset you are comparing to the market index is a share of common stock, the beta you are looking at is levered if the company has debt or preferred stock. The technique your professor is alluding to is the process of unlevering betas of two different companies that may have similar underlying operating assets but because of different capital structures, have different betas when using their common stock returns. This adjustment makes comparing different betas between companies agnostic of the capital structure used.
