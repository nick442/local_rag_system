This has been alarmed on for years. From the explosion in housing cost and resulting debt, to loans being off-balance-sheet, to the high amounts of subsidization of industry (i.e. finished steel beams being delivered to countries for less than some pay for raw iron ore). There simply isn't a way of knowing how or if it will fall out, since the government is already putting controls in place. And it is even harder to tell because of the lack of transparency from the Chinese government.
