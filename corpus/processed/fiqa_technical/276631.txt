I think you leave out the major problem of your partners in crime there. Chances are one of them will eventually slip up later in life, and at some point snitch on you in order to get out of trouble. This is particularly true if you would manage to acquire amounts in the 100k range per participant. The inside man would pose the greatest risk there.
