The closest thing to a libertarian society (to my mind, the American revolution) was relatively stable and amazingly prosperous for hundreds of years. To my mind, the shows that it is possible, at least to some extent. The defining characteristic of a government is that the majority of people perceive their usage of aggressive force as legitimate. Without that sense of legitimacy, no government could ever rule. That is why I think that anarchy is stable. Coercion is just vastly more expensive than co-operation. Without a body of people willing to pay for their own coercion, organisations that seek to coerce will be at an incredible economic disadvantage. You want to be careful writing things off as impossible just because of history. Before the Wright brothers, all attempts at powered flight had failed as well. We must always keep the goal in mind, even if we are still unsure of how to attain it.
