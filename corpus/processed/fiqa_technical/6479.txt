"Thank you for some specific issues, from a former member. I see the company I work at making similar motions, hopefully I can start saying things like ""look, here is how that played out at GE"" Currently I'm trying to push the idea of RACI here so we'll see if we can't actually start an improvement. Edit: and not in response to you, but it's amazing how much push back I got from the generic ""blame the execs"" crowd. Large org are different from family businesses. It seems like people feel it's like running a coffee shop."
