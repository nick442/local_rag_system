As a gun person, anyone not buying right now is an idiot. Guns ammo and accessories will likely never be cheaper and more accessible then right now. People who only panic buy astond me. How short sighted my god. Seriously I remember when Obama got in, the price of stripped AR15 lowers nearly tripled at one point. Unbelievable
