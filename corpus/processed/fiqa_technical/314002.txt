It appears that hashes starting with 00000 are password already 'reversed' (I don't know the correct word for it). So if you want to test if your password is in the file, you'll have to look for your original hash and 00000restofyouroriginalhash Example for 'linkedin': * 7728240c80b6bfd450849405e8500d6d207783b6 is not present * 0000040c80b6bfd450849405e8500d6d207783b6 is present Python script to do it quickly if you are interested : from hashlib import sha1 def check_pass(plaintext, offset=5): hashed = sha1(plaintext).hexdigest() return (hashed, '0' * offset + hashed[offset:])
