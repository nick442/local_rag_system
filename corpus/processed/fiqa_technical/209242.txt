"There were a lot of these articles before Facebook went public. The Economist thought that Facebook would go public at $28-35 a share. Their article on the Facebook IPO [urged caution and pointed out red flags](http://www.economist.com/node/21554532). The articles on Reddit just before Facebook went public were about General Motors pulling its advertising from Facebook. I think that reddit's consensus was ""overvalued""."
