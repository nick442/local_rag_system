This is unfortunately what happens when people just blindly post something to reddit without knowing what they are talking about. A post of this type is more along the lines of what you see typically posted in /r/occupywallstreet - not that I have anything against Occupy, but far too often you have neckbeards that post things there that are little better than left-wing tabloid journalism that is often no better than the likes of Fox News.
