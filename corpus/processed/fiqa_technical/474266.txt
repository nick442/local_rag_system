This is a facility called Home Banking, which banks in some locations offer. You do not necessarily have to be super-rich to use it though. Kotak Mahindra Bank has been offering it here in India for about 10 years now. Other banks have followed suit with similar offerings. I am not super-rich or anywhere close1, but I have used this facility occasionally when I couldn't visit an ATM or the branch, to either get cash delivered to me, or to deposit cash into my account. The banks do charge a convenience fee for this facility as you might expect, but they waive it off if your average monthly balance exceeds a certain amount. Not sure about how it works in other countries, but here in India, if you have an account with one of the top customer-friendly banks, this facility is as mundane as a cheque book or a debit card. 1 If I were, I probably wouldn't be posting here. ;-)
