Australia is not really comparable. Where she lives in the US, there are 2-3 bedroom homes to rent for $125 per week. An apartment at the luxury end of the spectrum could be had for $250 per week (which is not viable for a minimum wage earner). Expenses in the US are far lower than Australia in most areas (outside of healthcare and higher education). Her life on $1700 per month in Kansas, is probably closer to the life of someone on $40k per year in Sydney. Not easy, and necessary to be frugal, but not at homeless levels.
