"I'm usually not a fan of video compared to text, but I agree that this was an effective use of video. Let me use one example that struck me. They use the term ""commission"" at one point. Some of their viewers may not know what a sales commission is. Some will. They could explain it and bore the latter viewers. They could not explain it and lose the former listeners. Instead, they just play a cash register sound when they mention the term ""commission"", which clues in the former watchers and doesn't bore the latter watchers to tears."
