Oh, give me a break. This argument asserts that people can never veer from the career path they chose at 17 when applying for universities. It's also inconsistent to state that veterans--regardless of whether they studied IT or cybersecurity--are qualified, then go on to state that only people who studied IT in university are qualified. This argument asserts that all adult education and job retraining efforts are for naught, and that experience on the job is less important than the primary focus of study decades ago. Seriously, give me a break, and join the real world. I'm not making any claim as to her competence in the role because there were clearly severe mistakes made, but the idea that decades-old coursework in a constantly-changing field is somehow more valuable than recent experience is ludicrous. Should I fire my DBA who has a law degree, since despite his 25 years IT experience, he clearly doesn't have any interest in informatics? Should I fire my PM who was a non-degree-holding housewife until entering the workforce eight years ago after her divorce? Should I promote my MBA-holding Marine rifleman to head Risk & Compliance, since military experience is apparently more applicable than the Finance degree of the person who currently holds the role? The only thing at issue here is whether she has training or certifications, hired experienced experts for key roles, built a culture of openness and honesty, followed best practices, and built a competent organization. Her actions are what speak to her inability to properly manage her organization; what undergraduate degree she holds doesn't matter one whit.
