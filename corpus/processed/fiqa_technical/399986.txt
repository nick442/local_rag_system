Funny, you picked just about the one business that I'm expecting to fall *because* it runs on weak market sentiment. The moment Uber stops subsidizing their rides it will become far more viable for localized ridesharing networks to undercut them and ride the wave of litigation/etc their efforts passed. Not to mention their competition which have much less to pay back to their investors. Uber users are mostly bellweather fans happy to hop to a new service that undercuts them with no love lost between them and Uber (once they use up any credits/etc they had saved up). Without autonomous, Uber's dead in the water.
