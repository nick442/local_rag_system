I found this article to clarify some of the issues. One point raised is that the concession can be thought of as getting tax exemption for the closing costs, which normally are not allow. I'm not sure I follow this logic, since you can only deduct the interest, not the principal. I asked a lender, and he verified you can only spend the concession money on closing costs. I think if your closing costs are less than 1% of the loan, its probably not worth it to go for a concession over the price reduction. With interest rates so low, its also not cost effective to buy down points on the loan. This should limit most of your closing costs.
