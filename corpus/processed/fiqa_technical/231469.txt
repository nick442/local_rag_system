What I think Warren means is that people like him are really good at making money and setting things up to continue being rich. In Warren's case he's very good at evaluating businesses and if they would be good investments. In the micro this isn't really a problem. Instead the problem is on the macro-level. When enough potential market participants (i.e. people / businesses) aren't enabled to participate in the economy in the same way. This feeds into a growing wealth inequality. The people who have the resources to continue playing the game can also continue with more chances. It's a Pareto Principle situation. No opportunity to play, little to improve, and a continually disadvantaged population. Add time into the soup. Rich get richer, the poor poorer, the gap widens more. Add inflationary mechanics, and the fact that being poor is more expensive. Add debt and an inability to purchase for long term solutions. You get a situation where 99% of the money is cycling around in the top 1% of players. The other 99% of potential market participants are poorly utilized up to the point where their wealth is something they have trouble spending for things like..healthcare. The idea of poorly utilized market participants is key. A growing economy wants more bandwidth. It wants more agents or market participants contributing to the flow. Get rich enough and you'll find you can't spend more than the interest on investments. On the contrary if you don't have very much money, it's easy as hell to spend it quickly! It's straightforward to say that if more of the global population weren't in debt, if they weren't in a state where they can't participate in economic growth, then maybe the economic growth of human society wouldn't be so bottle-necked.
