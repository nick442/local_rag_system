* Building out infrastructure is time-consuming and labor-intensive. You also have no guarantee that because you put fiber to every house in a neighborhood, that every person will sign up for your service. * Building out infrastructure requires permits from the municipality and surveying (underground wiring? On new poles? On existing poles? etc). * It requires tying into existing networks (more infrastructure, permitting, and commercial contracts. * If you want to offer telephone services, that requires more network interfacing and, permitting, and has additional requirements, as phone service has legacy legal requirements. * If you want to offer TV services, you need more infrastructure, and commercial contracts with the TV channels. In many municipalities, existing providers (IE Comcast, TWC) have exclusive contracts with the city that say no one else can come in and build a network. **TLDR:** Legal contracts, commercial contracts, and the expense of building out the actual infrastructure make it pretty much impossible to create your own ISP, unless you have regular money bonfires (like Google does).
