More than you would think. I graduated with a MS in Finance last year, and it had a lot of what other people said - linear algebra, statistics..you need to know calculus 2 like the back of your hand, and a lot of cal 3 as well. The thing I found, even with a BS in finance, was that the amount of math in undergrad is FAR below the amount of math you need in even just the master's program.
