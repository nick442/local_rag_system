"From the Cato Institute: > Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution says that Congress shall have the power ""to establish Post Offices and post Roads."" Thus, the Constitution allows the government to get involved in postal services, but that doesnâ€™t mean that the government has to be involved, let alone be granted a monopoly over mail. Doesn't say they can't privatize it here, but that's the only thing I've found so far.
