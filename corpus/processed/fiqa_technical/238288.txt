I'm aiming to buy in four and a half years.. I'll have about $120k in savings between various accounts and be making $52k a year with no debt and no obligations.. no kids, I'll have excellent credit (building it--I didn't want cards while paying off student loans) and still.. I'll be lucky to be able to afford a 600 sq foot condo with a $300/mo HOA fee. Fucking SF Bay Area. I can't even afford to live in a Section-8 complex right now. Seriously. What the bloody fucking fuck ($1,500/mo if you're not Section-8.. they get discounts). Thank goodness for my dad, he's the only reason I was able to pay off my student loans within two years of getting my current job and the only reason I am able to save so much. Our system is seriously fucked. People making $44k a year should be able to afford an apartment within a hour commute of work in an area where they don't have to dodge bullets or fight rats..
