"Do you have the felling this is going to get much much worse before it gets better? I mean, Greece is going through with austerity measures and will be cutting gov't spending and raising taxes again. They will be cutting over 150,000 gov't workers, pensions cut, etc. How are they ever going to grow? If Spain and Italy follow in this practice, I see another ""loss decade"" just like Japan went through. If not a total EU collapse."
