Can we just focus on one? Can you explain the NBA? I'm curious why it's ok to suggest that blacks have darker skin, but not they're stronger or more athletic? They're both physical traits. Who cares if it's true or not true? You'll never uncover the right answer if you go in wanting the answer to be a certain way.
