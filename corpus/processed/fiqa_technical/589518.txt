It all depends on how you feel about your employer. Obviously you had positive feelings about yours, but often that's not the case. >It's not a good idea to leave anywhere, even if you hate it, on bad terms. It gives everyone there a bad sense of you and can come back to bite you in the future. I think this is actually bad advice. Treating bad employers well is sending them the wrong message and encourages them to continue treating people poorly. While I wouldn't suggest to set the building on fire before you leave or to leave a piece of shit in your desk drawer, there is really no need to be extra nice to an employer who has been a major dick to you. The dick employers treat their employees as inanimate replaceable resources, so it's only appropriate to return the favor by treating your employer in precisely the exact same way.
