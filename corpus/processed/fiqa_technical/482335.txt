"I'm just wondering how you would go from buying a 60k car knowing that it had a software limited battery to ""I'd be pissed"" when that is activated for you for free during a hurricane evacuation. Now obviously you wouldn't buy a Tesla in the first place, and I have no problem with you generally disliking them, but if you did, you probably wouldn't be pissed because you already knew about it."
