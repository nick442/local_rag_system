"> I'm not aware of anyone making a screening tool that can integrate all of these things simultaneously. What is the best environment to create a tool like this? Everyone has one but they're all proprietary. Most common new stuff I've seen in the HF space are C# or Python. R is growing significantly in the space, but it lends itself to one-off data analysis better than writing large applications that have to do a lot of other ""stuff"", where Python's module universe is more exhaustive. Everyone is going to recommend whatever languages *they* are comfortable with, but the correct answer is probably whatever *you* are most comfortable with."
