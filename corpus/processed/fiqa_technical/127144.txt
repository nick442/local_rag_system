I love working for a CU. Our CRO revels in articles like this. He will post them and tell us this is why we do what we do. We would rather be financial physicians. Our job is heal financial worries and get people on the right path. I have seen our lenders convince folks to not take a loan best that is truly in their best interest. I have seen our investment group tell folks that their investment goals and personal goal don't line up and honestly they should wait. We also do crazy stuff like identifying folks who live in the flood zones and offer them 90 day loan deferment with no fees. That and a care loan for repairs. It's an insanely low interest loan (2%) to help folks get their repairs done. We also lowered our credit requirements for that to where just about every who needs it qualifies. It's also hard to get fired. If you don't hit your sales goal it's ok. You will not lose your job. Yes we are encouraged to meet our goals with incentives but we pretty much get paid something no matter what you do. Pretty much the only way to get fired is to pull a Wells Fargo. If you do something like that your ass is not only fired, the CRO will personally come down and will kick you out the door. Hell, I wouldn't be surprised if if he then tied you to his car and dragged you down the street. And you know what, it's working. We are repeatedly breaking every record we set for ourselves. Record loans, record deposits, record account openings. And you better believe that is heavily audit internally and externally. We actually hire auditors to make sure this crap doesn't even start. TLDR; Wells Fargo is the devil. Credit Unions Rule!!!
