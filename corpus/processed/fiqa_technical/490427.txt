I have a loan through them. Maybe you're one of my investors. Lol. Been thinking about becoming a lender now that my finances are back in order. The only drawback to the loan through them is that they don't let you change your payment due date. They have a grace period that you can still pay the loan by without a penalty, but after my work pushed our pay date back by 5 days, it was barely enough. And now I don't have a grace period. Overall am happy with them tho.
