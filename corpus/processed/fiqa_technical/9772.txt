Has anyone on this thread experienced this firsthand? I am interested in talking with older tech workers who have encountered the kind of ageism, or the kind of college campus, hackathon atmosphere of a young tech company that caters more toward twenty-somethings than employees with families. I report for Marketplace and am covering the issue.
