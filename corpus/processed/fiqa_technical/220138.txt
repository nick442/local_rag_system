"Some additional information for the people who may read this question in the future : The situation is weird, to say the least. I'm going to assume 2 things : Now, look at these classic its-a-scam red flags : In these conditions, it is not safe to give even the smallest shred of information to such people. I'd advise you to ignore this person (best option), or to offer to get them in touch with an official (most scammers will run away at this point) or threaten to report them (not recommended, the scammer may take insult and try to ""get back at you""). Hope this post helps and nobody gets scammed! EDIT: Thank you for the amazing welcome! If I'd have known I'd get such a huge response, I'd have written a better answer ;) (I hope I'm not breaking any rules by this edit)"
