We have five domestic breeds: pink, Chum, sockeye, coho, Chinook (king, spring are other names). They have very distinct characteristics on size and shape and even taste. They look quite different when they spawn. Sockeye turn red. Chum turn purple. Pink get this ugly hump. Atlantic have their own characteristics that are different from our five wild breeds.
