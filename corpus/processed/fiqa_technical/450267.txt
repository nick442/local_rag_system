I know what I was trying to say. It has nothing to do with trump as the article seems to lean towards. The jobs in Florida were already there. I don't think trump Had anything to do with the several walk in clinics to open in my city this year. Nor the hiring of more teachers under Obamas fiscal year. The only thing preventing anyone here from getting a job is the ability to walk in and start at your convenience.
