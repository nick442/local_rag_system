Looks to be a competitor of PayPal, you transfer money and they keep it in virtual account .. enable transfer and receive funds .. Nope the funds are not backed by any Central Banks if that is what you are looking at. If you want to use it, my recommendation is not to keep a large balance. If it goes down, one cannot even trace their owners.
