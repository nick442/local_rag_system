I love how you so thoroughly believe that citing a reference (i.e. someone ELSE) somehow defines what is true/false.. and how oblivious you are relative to your own gullibility via that. > This is a waste of my time. Which is obviously nothing new for you. Have you actually ever done anything that ISN'T a waste of time?
