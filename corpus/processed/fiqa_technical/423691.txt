Honestly, I don't know if we're ever going to find an ideal. I'm starting to see us as the EU fiscal problems. Too many *vastly* different people/ economies trying to find a one size fits all solution. I am strongly opposed to the well being of people being in the hands of a for profit company, be it health care/ education/ prisons. On the other hand governments and especially their employees can be, and are wasteful and inefficient. I believe that your health is *mostly* personal responsibility. Of the [top ten leading causes of death,](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/lcod.htm/) I see the majority being mostly preventable on some level. But this all opens many other cans of worms.
