"Aren't member states doing that already? I understood every European state already pays to the central EU ""government"" (or whatever the exact term is), and that indeed for some states already pay more than they receive. Ultimately though, I can't help but think something similar must already happen within the country as well. Without a doubt there will be richer and poorer regions in Germany. Maybe Frankfurt is quite rich and the southern part is poor? But does that mean Frankfurt should become an independent country, or does it mean people from Frankfurt aren't proud to have the rest of the country as a part of Germany?"
