um, no. In a lot of ways, apple is much worse than MS with its proprietary everything. MS will run on anything as will Linux. Apple is truly great if you want new shiny, but I am less than impressed with its actual functionality in some ways. I would personally use Linux on the desktop if I were going away from MS.
