Finance is more local than global. There's a few mega banks but a lot of people still prefer small banks and credit unions. I would say Oil. OPEC has that shit locked down. They make a ton of money because they're crooks and they fix the prices. Thanks to electric cars however, their whole industry is going to collapse in a handful of years. And good riddance. Parasites all of them. None of the people getting rich from Oil have spent any time getting their hands dirty retrieving it. They use poor people to dig the shit up and then they re-sell the shit to other poor people while collecting far too much money in transit. Parasites all of them.
