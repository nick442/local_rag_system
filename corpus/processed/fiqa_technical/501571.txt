I can state with absolute certainty that 75K a year would _not_ be the line. If is well above the point where lack of money ceases being a misery generator though. I think I'd probably need a curve to be optimal -- there's a lot of stuff I'd need up front, but once that was done (and a reserve set up for truly awful expenses like insane medical bills) I'm betting a stable flow of 40K/year would keep me very happy indeed. It'd be even less, but I really like to travel, and expansive trips every couple months would get rather expensive. Discounting travel, I could easily be quite happy with half of that.
