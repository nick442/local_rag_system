> If you can't cough up $200 for this, you need to rethink if you are in business or playing at being in business. You don't know anything about my financial situation and I resent the implication that poor people shouldn't start businesses. Also, the whole project is less than $200 so it wouldn't make much sense hiring a lawyer.
