"Jesus Christ. I thought this subreddit was somewhat intellectual. zerohedge.. seriously? The former CEO of Equifax has earned $18 million in pension benefits over his tenure. That is money he has already earned and is entitled to under any circumstance. He will not be receiving a bonus for 2017. And he will not be receiving any severance pay.

Zerohedge should not be allowed in this subreddit. Here's their description on wikipedia >Zero Hedge's content has been classified as ""alt-right"", anti-establishment, conspiratorial, and economically pessimistic, and has been criticized for presenting extreme and sometimes pro-Russian views https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/09/26/equifax-ceo-retires-following-massive-data-breach/"
