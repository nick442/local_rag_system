Agreed. But this isn't the fault of business. You could argue that entrepreneurs are failing to some extent in figuring out how to take advantage of an overly-abundant but still somewhat valuable resource (low skilled labor). However, with complex work rules, and laws that make it illegal to offer workers wages commensurate to their skill level, I think it the problem of unemployment is can be more correctly blamed on government. Lack of education/skill translates to lower wages. Having an artificial cut-off, making it illegal to hire low-skilled workers makes increased unemployment of low skilled workers inevitable.
