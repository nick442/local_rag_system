I am still fairly early on in the process so I can't give you the best insight. I study at a CC in California and one of the biggest roadblocks is finding like minded individuals. Most of the students have no interest in being there so it's hard to connect with 18-19 year-olds about finance/econ. Personally, I am going to have to overcome my shitty high school transcript to get into the top schools. I have a 3.8, tutor econ and accounting for the school, am president of the veterans' club, and am founding the business club next semester. That still might not be enough, which stresses me out. If you have a good academic history and thrive in CC you should have a much better chance than I.
