"I once went to Walmart to buy an iPod touch. The price on the site was the same as on Amazon, and I figured getting it that day would be worth the extra money paid to sales tax. When I got there and went to the Electronics checkout, I found that it was 10-15% more than Amazon's price. I pointed out that the website had it for less, and he said ""They have to compete with Amazon and such, so it's cheaper online."" I went home and ordered it from Amazon."
