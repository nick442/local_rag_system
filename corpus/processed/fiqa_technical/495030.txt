just had a disastrous trip a few weeks ago to Brazil with American. First flight was delayed 1.5hrs making us miss the connection. They put us up for the night and then flew us to another city in the morning (flight delayed again) for a different connection at 11PM that night onto Brazil. [That 11PM flight didn't start boarding till 1:30AM.](http://i.imgur.com/VVY6z.png) They actually had to bring in a different plane something was so wrong with the first one. Flight from Brazil back also delayed, the connection after that to home was not. 5 flights, 4 delays, 1 missed connection. Never again.
