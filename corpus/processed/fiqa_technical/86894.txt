Former sailor here. The blue and white crackerjack jumpers are globally unique garments. It is a dress uniform. I have owned exactly two of each in my lifetime, and the second was because I changed sizes in my 20's. Even the cloth is something that I haven't seen in any civilian clothes. Occasional shortages like this are an expected consequence of having unique formalwear, and doesn't say anything about US manufacturing capabilities. Note that the day-to-day working uniforms are still well stocked. This is just a supplier EOLing a low-margin low-volume product. Happens every day.
