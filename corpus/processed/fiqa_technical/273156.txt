"Sigh. You need to educate yourself regarding the recent financial crisis before claiming the government had to bail out JP Morgan. The reason I said you don't know the difference between a depository bank and an investment bank is because JP Morgan isn't even the institution that ""gambled"" nor was it the institution that needed a bail out. It's one of the institutions that bought the toxic assets, thereby assuming the risk and mitigating what would've been a global catastrophe. Furthermore, you seemingly don't understand the concept of a bail out considering you think the TARP cost the tax payers money which is also false. The reason I was condescending towards you is because you insulted the CEO of a bank that had nothing to do with the housing crisis, and in fact kept us from what would've resulted in an economic depression at a minimum. ""Fuck you"" to the guy who was partly responsible for keeping our economy afloat and has every right to be frustrated at this point in time is so moronic that I don't even know where to begin."
