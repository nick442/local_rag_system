looking at flights available, a lot had very full seating. I could save some money if i want a long layover, like 20 hours, but i am not doing that on vacation with kids. I probably could have waited another month or 2 but my wife is a teacher and she was getting nervous about flights filling up. but at $650 per round trip ticket for that spring break week...probably not going to find anything much cheaper. I'll keep an eye on kayak.com, and hope i didn't pull the trigger too soon.
