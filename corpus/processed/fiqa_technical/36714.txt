">And, a broadcast company with several channels, don't forget that part that makes you totally wrong. I am not forgetting anything. You don't seem to get a broadcasting is media and part of media. Like I said they are a media company. No different from saying Time Warner is a media company or Disney. >Buzzfeed's scoops are about stars dating each other, political stories, etc. Vice does pieces on buying nukes on the black market, the inside tour of North Korea (you know that claim that they have the same fat kid and fake grocery stores full of fake food? Have you actually visited their website? It has such stories such as ""Turns Out It's Totally Cool to Have a 20-Pound Lobster in Your Suitcase"" and ""The Mothers Haunted by Their Sons' Unsolved Murders"" as well as ""D.R.A.M. Opens Up About Being a 'Big Baby' on 'THE THERAPIST'"" and ""New Yorkers Love Pride, Hate Trump"". Really no different from Buzzfeed except Vice doesn't do the whole list thing. >Do you not understand that your derivative argument is faulty? Nope, as it is not faulty. You can claim it is all you want, but until you prove its faulty its not. And you yet to prove its actually faulty. >You are judging the quality of a story by your negative opinion of the producer and publisher's reputation: that's subjectivity. One I told you I read the article and it was crap, you even agreed with me it was crap. Two media companies do screen what content is on their platform. Meaning if they are smart they check for the quality of content as well. Thirdly didn't I tell you like 3 times now to stop making leaping assumptions and bullshit claims? Yet you continue to do so. And for someone claiming to have good analytic skills you certainly fall short in them."
