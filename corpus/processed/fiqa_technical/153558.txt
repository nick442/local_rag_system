No and you don't want tips from me. I live in the same house as my ex-wife which should give you a tip about how successful I've been. Truthfully though, I've done well for myself, but she's unemployed and it lets me see my son everyday. You should get tips from professionals and not Reddit. Reddit's great for cats though.
