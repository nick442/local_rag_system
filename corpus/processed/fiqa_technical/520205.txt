Patience is the key here, I hate to say! There are five factors to FICO credit scores: Payment history is adversely affected by late payments - so always pay on time, otherwise your report will be haunted for seven years! ðŸ‘» Credit utilization has to do with how much of your available credit is currently in use - lower is better, but 0% isn't good either because they want to see that you're using credit. 10% or less is a good goal, and try to keep any single card balance to 30% or less when its statement close date rolls around. Credit history is based on the average age of all of your accounts, cards or otherwise, the older the better. Don't close either of your other cards (because that would cause your average account age to fall), and make sure to use the store card at least occasionally, because lenders sometimes decide to close unused lines of credit. Credit mix has to do with the different types of credit you hold and is why your bank's website suggested taking out a loan.

Sit tight, as annoying as that is!
