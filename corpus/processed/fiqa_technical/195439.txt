He's not asking for advice, he's advertising. Every male in Cambodia drives and sleeps in their tuk-tuk, he's trying to differentiate himself from the 1000s of others parked in the shade, hoping for a tourist dollar so they can pay off the 50% interest loan on their tuk-tuk. Cambodia is wonderful, life-changing and Angkor Wat (the total experience of the pulgrimage) should be on every jaded Westerner's bucket list. You will see your world through fresh eyes if you truly open yourself to the Cambodian experience.
