Well, learn SQL if you want - certainly a good skill to have, but generally there are tools in applications like SAP to help you get at the data you need. There are people who exclusively program in SQL full-time, so I wouldn't worry too much about demonstrating that - Excel is probably much more useful, and perhaps presentation skill. Still, if you aren't getting calls back, consider making a better resume and do follow-up calls with every application.
