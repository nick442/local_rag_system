"Because its going to effect a lot of people's jobs but being able to work deals with those jobs on the table ""is essential to US business export interests"" </sarcasm> in the rapidly growing developing countries, which have a surplus of skilled workers who could do those jobs. Without privatizing education, they could not put those hundreds of thousands of jobs into play. the same thing goes for health care, (which Ive heard described repeatedly in terms like ""the one bright spot in an otherwise dismal economy"" - a dangerous situation because they mean exactly what it sounds like) They could not be giving discounts to Americans or having public health care here. Its too important to the US insurance and drug industries that US trade ~~ideological~~ goals be maintained purely and consistently. </sarcasm>"
