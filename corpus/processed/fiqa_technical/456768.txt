If the work was 90% finished, you can only defer 10% of the income until next year. You can only fully defer revenue that you haven't made deliverables on yet - you can fund the project with deferred revenue, however. Of course, there's a gray area as to completion percentage, but you're starting to play with fire when you do too much of that. Probably depends on his business, short answer.
