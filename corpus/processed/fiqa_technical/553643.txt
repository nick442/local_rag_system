Third year here, and let me echo what everybody below is saying: math, math, math. That being said, most programs will give you a chance depending on your quant score from the gmat/gre. It had better be high though, low seven hundreds wont even garner a look from any school in the top 20 (and your quant should be higher than your verbal). From what it looks like from your background it sounds like the masters would be helpful (although a masters in econ wont be as much of a help as you think; finance is a sub field of econ, and so to justify our work we have to distinguish ourselves as much as we can..). My advice is use the masters to take probability theory, and statistics courses (or econometrics) and as many of them as you can. My next advice is apply to as many schools as you can afford and stagger the applications across school rankings. Some of the foreign students in my program have told me that they sent out dozens of applications and that even 100 apps is not unusual. I call it the shotgun approach. Third I will agree with some of the other comments in that you will need less math for corporate stuff and or behavioral/experimental stuff. BUT it is unlikely that any school will take that into consideration. I cant think of any other phd student that I have talked to, from many other programs, that don't have to take asset pricing and other theory courses. PhD programs start very generally and then you are allowed to specialize as time goes on. Basically, expect this shit to be hard. Finance profs are some of the highest paid in academia, which means there is an insane amount of applicants for each spot. In my program we average 400 qualified applicants a year for a meager three spots. And many of the applicants will already have Phds in physics, math, or engineering (they get tired of making no money as a post doc, and decide to come for another one in finance where they can get paid). Not to discourage you at all, but revise your expectations.
