If you can't accept that population growth is the largest driver of demand, we'll just have to agree to disagree. Sewing needles are absolutely driven by population growth. As the population grows, so too does the demand for textiles. Therefore if one factory is capable of producing clothes for 100 people and automation doubles its output, growing the population to 400 would create jobs by necessitating another factory, even though automation increased efficiency.
