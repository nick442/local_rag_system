Unfortunately, there isn't much you can do. If your name was on the mortgage, you owe the money, regardless of who kept the house. They can (and likely will) come after you for the money as well. A bit late in your case, but that's why when people divorce, refinancing the house into one person's name (and the other quit-claiming their interest) is usually part of the settlement. ETA: As others have mentioned, since you are in California, it appears that they cannot come after you for the difference.
