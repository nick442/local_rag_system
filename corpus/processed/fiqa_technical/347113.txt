How is Floyd bad with money? I'm going to need you to explain that if you're going to make statements like this.. This is a guy who owns several businesses, brands, and has an investment portfolio that would make anyone's mouth water. He's incredibly good at making money, so even though he's extravagant and flaunts his money, that doesn't mean he's making bad financial decisions.. he can afford to spend it, so why the fuck shouldn't he? You just hate him cuz he's a dick that makes life look easy as fuck.. get over yourself
