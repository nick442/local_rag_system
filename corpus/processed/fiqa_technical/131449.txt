>The problem I have with this line of logic is that it's pretty much the anti-net neutrality argument. I think there is a key difference here, at least for me. I view internet access as a utility, like water or power. Companies shouldn't be able to arbitrarily decide who gets access to those utilities. Some people may not see it the same way and that is fine.
