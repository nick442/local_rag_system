"I have an Asus T100. It's the same basic idea (10"", full Win 8.1, detachable keyboard) but less powerful and the build quality isn't quite as nice. However it comes with an Office license, the keyboard dock (which I like better than the Surface options), is completely fanless, and only $300-$400. You're right about the idea of the Surface Pro being a winner. I have zero interest in purchasing a regular laptop again after using this. It also gets much more use than any tablet that I ever tried and gave up on, both iPads and Android. I've got tablet and complete desktop functionality on one device. I love it."
