I love Toronto too.. and I think finance people are mostly the same everywhere, just that there's more room some places than others. I mean siphoning funds assuming that you're going to be running a HFT shop or prop trading or using models to predict when something is most profitable, which is beneficial to your wallet but not really to society. What do you hope to be doing as a quant that won't be taking money from people who don't trade as well as you? Like, I replied to belgianroffles, I don't think there's anything ethically wrong with it.
