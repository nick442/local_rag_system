I'm not necessarily saying that VC is the way to go. It works for some, not for others. Personally, if my company idea takes off, I'd try to avoid it if at all possible. However, the article was written in a way that any point she had in her post was overshadowed by her bitterness and excessive obscenities that it comes off as unprofessional and not worth reading. It takes away from the valid points therein.
