Honestly, the single best steak I've had has been at Applebee's. I order medium rare home style sirloin three times now, at 3 different establishments. Every damn time it is a melts in your mouth steak, a simple but damn effective flavoring, cheap as all hell. I can just shovel down Applebee's steak. Tldr: Applebee's has no reason to have decent steak, but they're consistently f***ing great
