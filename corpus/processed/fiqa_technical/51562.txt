Ummm I bet we didn't 'work less'. Everyday was a fight for survival. With no way to preserve food we either had to hunt gather daily and follow the food sources. While at the same time finding/building shelter, clothing and taking care of the family. A successful hunt would obviously be celebrated but a failed hunt could be disastrous.
