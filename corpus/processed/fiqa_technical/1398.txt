I would be weary using Yelp. I've read several stories of people being screwed over by them. For example, a company would have 10 five star reviews and one 2 star review. Yelp would only show the 2 star review on the company's main page, and would contact the business owner saying for a fee they would make the 5 star ratings show on the main page instead of the 2. Very shady but not illegal since you are opting in to use their service.
