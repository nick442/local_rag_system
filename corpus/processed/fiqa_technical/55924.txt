Isn't that a deduction mostly used by the top 1%? There seem to be mostly 2 types of people, those who own many homes, And those that rent them.. I always thought the mortgage interest deduction was used substantially more by the wealthy than the middle class.. (Luxury homes also offer higher deductions right?)
