I agree with what you're saying, that people aren't completely rational. But to build an entire system on their irrationality is ludicrous.. At some point, they figure it out. This is exactly how things change and change dramatically. > They are far too worried about the day-in day-out running of their business to spend their time day-dreaming of how to hide away all of their money once they become rich. Yeah, but if they don't think they're going to get rich, they'll simply stop minding the day-to-day. I would, and if they figure out that they're going to be patsies to be sacrificed at the altar of wealth redistribution, they're going to stop. Already, people are awaking to the fact that college educations do not bring them prosperity.
