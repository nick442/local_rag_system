Jason I think your doing a great thing. Based on what your describing I would look further into a 501(c)(3). Chapter 3 from the IRS Publication 557 offers information. This Wikipedia gives a quick understanding of 501(c)(3) and how to apply. Here is a great article from ehow it has some suggestions for someone who is just starting out. Maybe going through an organization already existing within your community might be a better, perhaps a church or some religious organization.
