Thanks for the post, these are good insights. I've found most of my personal success looking for work by way of the burgeoning technical recruiter industry - they know a bit more than an HR 'bot', either mechanical or human (haha), about the reality of technical requirements for a job and are able to find you if you just know where to place yourself. Getting solicited for a job by way of your LinkedIn profile is a much easier way of finding work than the futile carpet-bombing of large corporate HR machines, no doubt.
