"I don't know about that, how would anyone ever get loans? Of course I might just be limited to ""in the box"" thinking of the idea that we even need loans to facilitate the economy. I think maybe 90% reserves 10% lending or some other mix other than right now its currently law (in the US) that banks hold only 10% of the money in accounts as reserve while they can lend out 90%. I don't think it was ever intended to keep eroding like it has to the point where its 1:9 savings:loaned ."
