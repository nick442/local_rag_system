"You are wrong on the L1 visa with respect to ""no limit"".. there is an overall limit of 7 years max for L1a and 5 yrs for L1b. Also, it is only limited to companies who have offices in foreign countries where that worker must have worked at least 1 year in a managerial, Executive or special skill set capacity; so not every company would qualify to bring in L1 visa workers.. you are right about no required minimum with respect to salary but it would throw an unnecessary attention if a Manager you brought into the US getting paid peanuts so, that, in itself is a ""self regulator"" if you will."
