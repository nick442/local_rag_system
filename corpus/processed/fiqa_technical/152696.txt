"unless it tastes good. Occasionally, I believe that a very small portion of the population will forgo ""real food"" for some quick serve food that they happen to like: Chipotle Barbacoa burrito with marinated roast beef, black beans, grated cheese, sour cream, rice with lime and cilantro, and roasted chili corn salsa. And brought you by McDonald's. In the Austin area, they have taken a page from authentic Mexican food and serve Chipotle food from a truck. The irony is delicious."
