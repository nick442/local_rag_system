It's very, very unlikely that you received a phone call at work with an incorrect birth date from an actual lending company that thinks it loaned you any money. It's much more likely that you received a phone call at work from a collections agency that would have bought some loan from the aforementioned agency for pennies on the dollar. They would have been hunting around trying to find someone with your name who was born thirteen years earlier. It's even more likely that this is some sort of phishing scam. If you're worried, you can check your credit rating, but it is likely that you can safely ignore the situation. If they call back, ask for thorough details about the credit card. If they're a real collections agency and for some reason they won't leave you alone, IIRC the most surefire course of action is to hire a lawyer to send them a cease-and-desist letter.
