"No, because I assert that it's not *only* about these lucky events. It still takes some degree of intelligence, or insight, and hard work. Often a sociopathic ability to step on others is either necessary or at least a bit help, and sometimes it takes the ability to ignore various laws while staying out of trouble. What I'm saying is that it seems like a number of folks here want to believe the *only* differentiator is one of these ""lightning in a bottle"" events. I'm saying I think they're more common than we may think - it's only when the bottle is held by someone with the ability and drive to maximize the opportunity that we get a success story."
