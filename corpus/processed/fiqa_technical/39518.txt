Who says that both parents have to work? Also, why would you include that as an opportunity cost when a parent staying home can and often does save money from work clothes, lunches out, extra gas, car insurance for a second car, not to mention paying for and repairing a second car. In the end, when I did my analysis for my own life, if I worked full time, I was going to be in debt to keep working. My actual per hour pay when taking all of these things into account was less than $1 an hour. That doesn't even take into account daycare, days off of work for doctor visits, or anything else. It is actually much cheaper for a woman to stay home and be employed in the home economy when she is not making at least $10 to $15 an hour depending on where she lives. If my husband worked and I diligently tried to save money in other areas we were not currently saving money in, I would actually be earning my keep through home employment. Things like sewing clothes with materials found, canning foods, baking, gardening, raising our own milk and eggs in small amounts, and recycling everything instead of tossing and buying new reduced our cost significantly. Look even Elizabeth Warren says in this economy, that low skilled workers with less than a Bachelor's that want to have children would be better off doing it this way because of the price of everything. It is tantamount to turning everything we have been taught on our heads, but it is true if you run the numbers.
