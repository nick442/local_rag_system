If you hold at least $2,000 of a company's shares for at least a year you can submit a proxy filing -- a stockholder proposal at the shareholders' meeting. Then you can use the media to agitate around that proposal. (See Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, mentioned here as well). Companies have been known to bow to media pressure around minority shareholder proposals. The guidelines for proxy filings are here: http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&sid=47b43cbb88844faad586861c05c81595&rgn=div5&view=text&node=17:3.0.1.1.1&idno=17#17:3.0.1.1.1.2.82.201 Buying enough shares to assume control of a major money center bank is not possible, regardless of the amount of money you can raise (remember: there are poison pill provisions, not to mention the fact that the more shares you want to buy, the higher the price will be). tl;dr: The way to do what you're trying to do is not by accumulating shares but by using the media. You need $2,000.
