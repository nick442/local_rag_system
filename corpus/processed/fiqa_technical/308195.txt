The credits go to the buyers. TSLA's profit margin does not take into account any emissions credits. They did receive a nice big loan, and then they paid it back years early + interest. Currently their sales per square foot is twice of apple, and can increase demand at will. The federal tax credit to buyers being phased out will most likely be offset by reductions in battery cost when the time comes anyway. Do you also feel that the Model 3 will not happen? That car is the reason for the battery factory 'side show'.
