It might be reasonable, or it might be their error. Right now you have their assertion that they overpaid. So the range of outcomes runs from them collecting $0 to the full amount they assert. You are in a negotiation now, get your mind in this game. If they demonstrate to your satisfaction that they overpaid, you should pay. If the reason is not convincing, well, can they collect it? If there is a final pay then thats their last shot to do it internally. Is the amount in question more than the pay? When you were hired you may have authorized them to make correction withdrawls from direct deposit. I don't know if your new orders to your bank override this. If this is a risk ask the bank for a new account and close this one. Did you already sign exit interview paperwork that may ask you to do certain things like not work for a direct competitor, release and hold them harmless, or not discuss the company publicly? If not then there are two negotiations in play and it is fair to ask, in condideration for your signature, to settle any potential overpayment claims for $0 or as the money now stands. Do they do this to other people who leave?
