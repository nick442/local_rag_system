Yes, they're using it as a currency. What they actually have demand for is houses and Lambos, and if bitcoin wasn't available they'd be happy to do it in any other currency. When any other currency goes up it's because there's overall higher demand than supply for it, to buy things you can only buy in a particular currency. A very common example is government bonds of the issuing government for a currency. That's why when the Fed raises the interest rate, the US dollar goes up. It is because at a bond auction the government will only take US dollars so anyone that wants to buy some bonds needs to first buy US dollars. If the interest rate goes up, all things being equal those bonds are relatively more attractive than other countries bonds, and that change in demand increases the demand for the currency, which raises it's price. Note the key thing here - it needs to be something you can only buy (or at least, buy for the cheapest price) in a particular currency. If it's something you can buy with any currency, than that event generally doesn't impact the currency price. Although it's a very important food crop, if the price of rice goes up, it doesn't really impact the USD even though you can buy rice with USD. Here's the tricky part, what can you buy with bitcoin that you can't buy with any other currency?
