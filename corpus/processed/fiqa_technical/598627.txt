Well a) some people aren't in an area where broadband is even offered and b) if all you want is email, instead of giving your cable company $50 a month, giving AOL $21 a month is a better deal. That said, it's probably also true that a huge percentage of their users are still there through inertia or the misguided assumption that they'll lose their aol.com address.
