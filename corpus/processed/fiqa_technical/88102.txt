"Maybe it's a slightly different interpretation of ""slowing down"" that you're referring too, but selective procrastination can definitely save you money. It's basically a technique for advertisement resistance: When I see some item that I want (but really have no need for), I just procrastinate getting it. This mostly involves just not actively going out and getting it, waiting for it to go on sale (and then waiting for a better sale), and just generally being lazy about it. If I still want it by the time I get around to it, then it's usually something that I consider worth its value. Usually though, after a month or two, I've forgotten about it altogether and moved on to the next thing. This is most effective in avoiding buying the latest tech gadgets and depending on your gadget consumption can save you hundreds. I'm currently procrastinating buying an iPad until it either goes down in price, a nice alternative shows up, or I decide that it's worth getting myself to an Apple Store - or I decide it's not worth the hype altogether."
