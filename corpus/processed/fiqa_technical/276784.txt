"Some clarifications: they're going to ASSEMBLE PCs here, not exactly ""manufacture"" them. And they're not moving all ops to the U.S. - just a couple of product lines. I suspect this is mainly a result of tax incentives, cost efficiencies in the assembly value chain, and where Lenovo plans to actually sell these machines. Jobs wasn't wrong. Consumer electronics manufacturing is not coming back. And nor do we want it, reddit. That shit is at the very bottom of the value chain! If it WAS in the U.S., everyone would be jawing about how big bad Apple or Dell or whoever was only paying minimum wage for those crappy jobs, and it would STILL be uneconomical to build them here. The future is in the design, high-tech specialty manufacturing, and engineering that goes on WAY before a bunch of crappy PCs and laptops roll off the assembly line. We don't have enough people properly trained to do those things."
