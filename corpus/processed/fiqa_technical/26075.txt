"This is yet another in a long series of ""stop whining, the economy is fine"" articles. It's a lie. The economy is not fine. There are good points in the article and it is important to not be misled by bad statistics, but he works hard to pretend that there are not problems in places where those problems are evident in the statistics. He claims that falling labor force participation rate is because the statistics don't adjust to an increasing percentage of retirees, but everyone I know talks about the 25-54 statistics, in which retirement is negligible. When you compare those to overall numbers, it shows big problems in the 25-54 numbers, and that people over 54 are working more and longer than they used to, not retiring sooner, an indication that they can't afford retirement. He claims stagnation in median household income is misleading because of a 5% drop in hours worked, which is completely bogus given the scale of the difference we're talking about. Then he dismisses the disconnect between productivity and median wages by claiming that it's inappropriate to compare an average with a median, despite the fact that that's exactly what inequality is."
