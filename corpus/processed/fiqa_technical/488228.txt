In Germany in our discounters very often we have such store-owned off-brand boxes which look quite bland, but the content is not rarely made in the same factory as the higher priced brand. It just looks like that to save on marketing costs. Obviously it's not always like this but if you do some research you will find that sometimes cheaper knockoff brands even belong to the same parent company and/or are made at the same location as the premium product.
