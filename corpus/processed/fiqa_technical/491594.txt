"Say you need to use Einstein's field equations at work. If your job is to find the ""one equation to rule them all"" than you should ask questions concerning the validity of the equations and try to unify them in the quantum realm. But like most of us, if your job is find tune the many knobs that govern the output, you don't need to use math beyond what is already packaged in libraries. You still need to know what the equations are and what they do, but your interaction with them on a daily basis is call function X on object Y."
