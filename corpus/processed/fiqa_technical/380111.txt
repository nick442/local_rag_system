">Darden, based in Orlando, Fla., has made cost cutting a priority in recent years as sales growth and traffic have stalled at its flagship chains.. > Given the challenging job market, Darden has been able to offer lower pay rates to new hires. Bonuses for general managers have been reduced as sales have stagnated. Servers at Red Lobster are handling four tables at a time, instead of three. >And last year, the company also put workers on a ""tip sharing"" program, meaning waiters and waitresses share their tips with other employees such as busboys and bartenders. That allows Darden to pay more workers a far lower ""tip credit wage"" of $2.13, rather than the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. So their food sucks and they're cheap."
