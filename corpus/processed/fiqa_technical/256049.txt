"Would they let you buy your own Office 365 subscription? It's actually not that expensive, and IMO it's *worth* it. As a possible alternative (depending on how tech-savvy you are), you could install SQL Express for free, which now even includes SSRS. It's *not* Excel, but I've found that once you get past a certain level of complexity in Excel, you're basically trying to emulate the functionality of SQL with a real reporting tool talking to it. Might as well take that leap if they're forcing you to change anyway, and get the massively more powerful platform that comes with it. Make no mistake, I love all things Google, and I'm no Microsoft fanboy; but Excel is **the** ""killer app"" of the modern office environment. There's a good reason we've seen countless *free* alternatives pop up and fade away over the years."
