"I am guessing your comprehensive deductible is around $500, and a totaling of your car would net only a $5000 payout. The expected value of the insurance is payout * chance of occurrence. To keep things simple lets only analyze the chance of ""total"" event what percentage of occurrence would give you an expected value of the insurance of $300? $5000*P=300 = 6% This is simplified because it ignores smaller payouts, but I think it's probably not a good value for you as a totaling event would not be a desperate situation for you. You can take it on faith that the expected value of ANY insurance product is less than the cost, otherwise the company wouldn't sell it. You need to decide if the insurance product is something needed by you."
