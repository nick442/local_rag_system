"I've had an echo (well, now three of them) for more than two years. It starts out as a novelty. Then you find the things that are useful, which is mostly just kitchen timers, quick math &amp; conversion questions, music &amp; radio &amp; podcasts, and trivia questions to settle an argument. Sometimes I ask about the weather, something in the news, etc. And then, occasionally I'll order something or add something to a shopping list. The only home automation device I control with the echo is the thermostat (""Alexa, make it cooler""). The latest development is our acquisition of the Echo Show, which just adds a touch screen. That has added the ability to a. Shop visually, which I still don't do often; b. Entertain/distract my toddler for a few minutes in the kitchen (""Alexa, play Daniel Tiger""); and b. Video chat with my mom, for whom I also bought one (again, for keeping the kid occupied while we're cooking). So, all in all, I don't think I'm really using it the way Amazon wants (i.e., voice purchases, and buying more Alexa-connected devices because i have this hub), but I'm still happy with it and use it every day. And as you might gather, i am neither single nor old nor affluent. So that's my story."
