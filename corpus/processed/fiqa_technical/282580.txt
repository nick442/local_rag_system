You have some good points, but get this - it will certainly come a point of time where say 80% of the working population can provide 100% of the goods/services everyone needs. Then this will get to 70%. 60%. This can result in two things - either huge unemployment problem or overproduction and all that comes with it - spoilage, lower prices, cost-cutting (i.e. again unemployment). It may not be soon, but I think it's inevitable. The problem with that is, so far, employment is a great way to redistribute wealth (a fair way let's say), which is the actual problem at hand. Jobs wouldn't matter if we had another efficient mechanism to do that. In fact, it would be better if humans didn't have to work at all and focus on leisure, science, art, w/e. But we don't have such a mechanism unfortunately. And as the need for a labor force shrinks, things are going to get ugly, even uglier than now. Since the supply of labor will grow with human population, the price of labor inevitably will go down, which means even more transfer of wealth from middle/lower class to the capital owners.
