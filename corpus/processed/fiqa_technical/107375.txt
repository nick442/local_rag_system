Some of the farms have silos here as well, but as you say, the capital costs are prohibitive. Instead we tend to wrap it with plastics and let it lie on the field: http://www.flickr.com/photos/dkagedal/4949361930/ (the phenomena is popularily called 'tractor eggs'. I guess you can see why.). There is still a capital outlay but it is cheaper (at least in the short run) compared to silos. However, I agree that there might not be much use doing it if the cows can feed themselves outdoors during most of the year.
