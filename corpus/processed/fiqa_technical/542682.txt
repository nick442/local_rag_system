Any sort of semi-significant construction or infrastructure project takes an absolutely absurd amount of time. There was a road near where I used to live that took *30 years* in and out of courts, through all sorts of studies, with years of budget battles, political wrangling, and it was all for a lightly-used, 17 mile stretch that creates a slight shortcut between two suburban counties.
