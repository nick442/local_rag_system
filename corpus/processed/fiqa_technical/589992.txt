My local Ace hardware store is my new favorite place. It's definitely still the old school hardware store of my youth, aisles and aisles of fasteners of every kind with envelopes and pens to write down what you bagged. All the little fiddly bits of plumbing and cabinet hardware you can spend 40 days searching for in a Home Depot or Lowe's and never find. A crusty old geezer in the back who knows more than your dad when it comes to plumbing, concrete, framing, etc..
