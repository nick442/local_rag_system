Is it any different than if I decide to put similar amount of money in 401(k) at some other time of the year? Not from a tax standpoint, but if can affect a few other things: Since the earnings difference is likely negligible (you miss out on returns for only a few months), I would look at other conditions - In the long run it probably won't make much difference, but knocking out obstacles to wealth building can give you a sense of accomplishment that will encourage smart money decisions going forward.
