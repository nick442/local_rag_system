Are you kidding? Subsidized loans is effectively free money. Of course they're going to avail themselves. The real reason is prbably that Bernanke didn't want to be playing favorites (which he was). The level and quality of collateral required for these loans varied wildly, with very little explanation. Also, 16 trillion is a LOT of money to be given out as a subsidized loan, even if the quality of the collateral was high and the duration was short (which is NOT true for at least a trillion of that money).
