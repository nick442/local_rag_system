> at marked up groceries Groceries are the same price on all the services, or at least comparable to the fluctuations between store A and store B they charge a delivery fee (usually $5-8) and offer an option to tip / or include a mandatory service fee which goes to the shopper. So for me, I pay somewhere around $15-30 every 2-3 weeks to save 2 hours, the stress and hassle of parking, shopping etc. Sold. If I use Prime Fresh its less per delivery but has a membership fee. Did that for a while, I didnt order enough for it to make sense, but several people with kids who I turned on to it love it.
