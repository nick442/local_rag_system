Yea, because the question I asked was really indicative of what kind of employer I would be. I was a manager at a retail store. My employees loved working for me. In fact, after I moved on to a job in the field my degree is in, my old employees still contact me to hang out. You're an idiot for trying to make any kind of assumption about the kind of boss I am from that single question.
