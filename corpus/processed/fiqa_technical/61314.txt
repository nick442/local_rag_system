you very well may know better than me, honestly; but with any volatile investment, it is necessarily hard to predict their intermediate term trends. that would be my only caution to you! if you want speculative positions to hold, you might consider lower priced biopharms (though not pure penny positions). i made a bit of money on CCXI, for example. if you want more engagement/trading activity, consider tech trading or options (my personal favorite).
