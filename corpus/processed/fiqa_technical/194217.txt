"If I invest in individual stocks I will, from time to time, sell stocks that aren't performing well. If the value of my portfolio has gone up by 10%, then the value of my portfolio has gone up by 10%, regardless of whether selling those stocks is labeled as ""delete[ing] failures"". Same thing for mutual funds: selling underperforming stocks is perfectly ordinary, and calling it ""delete[ing] failures"" in order to imply some sort of dishonesty is simply dishonest."
