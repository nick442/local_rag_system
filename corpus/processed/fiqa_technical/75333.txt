"Boomers have also inordinately ""bid up"" the prices of a lot of things -- everything from stocks to housing -- simply because they as a ""bulge"" were all attempting to (in the aggregate) buy basically the same things at essentially the same time. Basically a LOT of demand chasing (and driving) a supply. This often made the previously acquired assets (i.e. the ""early boomer"" contingent who got there & bought in first) appear to increase quickly in price. The opposite effect will happen as they retire/die off -- either they (or their heirs) will choose (or need) to sell off their various accumulated assets. Then suddenly the supply will begin to ""bulge"" instead (selling off portfolios of stocks -- even *required* as pensions need to be paid, or as Boomers reach +70-1/2 and are mandated by law to begin selling off & cashing in specific %'s of their 401K and IRA holdings) -- and likewise with housing, aging Boomers will downsize, selling off the ""McMansions"" (which they never really needed, and which in retirement will be burdensome to maintain) and trying to move into (or selling off) the several second & third ""vacation homes"". End result will be a big ""dump"" of supply of housing onto the market -- a supply that GenX does not have the demographic numbers to ""consume"" (and which it does not appear the frugal-minded GenX even WANT to buy at anything like the same rates the Boomers did, even if they were capable of paying the price, which it also appears they cannot, having been ""hindered"" in career & salary gains by the bulge of Boomers in positions above/before them); and then GenY -- the ""Echo Boomers"" which while larger than X are NOT the equivalent of the original Boomers, and who are carrying an unprecedently huge (house-sized) debt load (but minus the house -- and in many cases as debt which cannot be erased as it is in student-loan form) from the beginning of their careers (in which they are being paid significantly LESS than previous generations) -- and who are delaying (and then limiting) the formation of ""households"" as a result. *And that is just how ""demographic bulges"" play out -- it was all entirely predictable (and was in fact predicted by many).*"
