Payroll is a huge part of any companies costs. I said that it would of course have different consequences for subway than it does for Walmart, but more and more chains are finding that it is feasible to pay people fair wages and still be able to thrive. Starbucks is yet another example of this. Businesses can't be held responsible to uphold social good on their own. Obviously, Subway has no real incentive to raise their wages. However, the government is responsible for policies that are good for the economy at large, and raising wages is one of the things they can do to stimulate an economy. It is true that typically it results in a small amount of job loss at first, but time and time again has shown net positives. Arguing against minimum wage or labor laws is just outright idiotic.
