"You are correct. Military spending is an incredibly inefficient form of stimulus, but it has the benefit of allowing a country to be more of an international bully as well as enriching politically useful cronies. We wouldn't want to spend a $1 trillion without ensuring sitting politicians could get reelected, would we? They might have to stoop to lobbying then! An additional bonus is that country will have excess weaponry to use in policing domestic dissidents, affectionately called ""The Poor."" Aren't the police part of our infrastructure? Isn't crime reduction of value to society? And, yes..this is sarcasm. I dislike talking about the MIC so much that it's difficult to do so without a lot of snark."
