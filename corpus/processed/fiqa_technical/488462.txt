I liked having HTC as an option but the last smartphone I bought from them failed after 5 months of use (screen completely failed to turn on unlike the rest of the phone) and they wouldn't even honor the warranty because I didn't buy it directly form a carrier. Shitty phones and shitty service is no surprise.
