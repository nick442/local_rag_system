You can buy anything low and sell high. I've been buying hype sneakers, clothes, and popular concert tickets and selling them for more on apps like GOAT, StockX, StubHub, or on local Facebook groups! Buying stuff from yard sales can be useful too! If you have some around you, sometimes they'll have BRAND NEW stuff that you can sell on eBay or something similar! I've made a goal for myself to hit $10k by flipping stuff, and I'm currently at $6k!
