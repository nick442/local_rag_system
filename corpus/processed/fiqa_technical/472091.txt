Thanks! I mean, I migghhht could work the days I am in town for school, and maybe one or two days on the weekend. However, they have me 5 days in a row and coming in so early and staying so late I barely have time to half-a** my assignments. Not working would really be best for me, though, since they have completely ignored my signed-off on schedule changes and are angry whenever they have to fix em.
