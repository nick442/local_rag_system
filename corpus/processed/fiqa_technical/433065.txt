"> I liked the work. But I was never going to like it enough to blow a weekend doing more of it for free. He wasn't working *for his employer* ""for free"", he was **""working"" for himself**. He had something to show for it, as in 'a network in his house'; that he didn't have to *pay someone else* to do or make. He also probably increased his value to his employer just as much as if he'd taken a class on Saturday morning instead. Jeez, Louise; is a garage mechanic who fixes his own car on the weekend *instead of paying other garage mechanics* ""blowing his weekend""?"
