Corporate debt isn't an iou. Large corporations sell bonds and make annual or semiannual payments in those bonds. Cash is often held in a country with favorable tax condition, like Ireland. Depending on the industry, this cash is invested in money market funds, fixed income securities, and maybe stocks or other funds. Because of the low interest rates that have prevailed since the recession, it's most economical to invest most cash and borrow for larger investments. However, the cash that ends up overseas is net of expenses. Internet is paid from operating income. I'm by no means an expert though, so take this with a grain of salt.
