"are you implying that employees with families, a desire for personal time, any degree of physical/mental ailment, are ""bad employees"". good AND bad employees are a risk when they are treated poorly with complete disregard. by enslaving the standard worker to a non-livable wage in which they cannot even afford to take time off you are virtually ensuring that no corresponding value can be added to the system except by those who are well off. I responded to another post in this thread asking what the minimum wage should cover. and i ask the same to you. what do you believe that index should be. by your logic, even slavery can be considered the index."
