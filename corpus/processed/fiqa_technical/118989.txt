You're thinking of general purpose computers. A Mac or Windows box runs millions of applications from millions of sources. That's usually why those computers crash. There are also thousands and thousands of hardware configurations, which compounds the problem. Tesla has one hardware set and they make their own software. One configuration and one application suite that's dedicated to a very narrow set of instructions with redundant systems and failsafes to stop the car if there were to be a catastrophic failure. As long as the system is well built and capable, it will have a long track history of safe transportation. Eventually, will something happen to the car to make it fail and kill someone? Maybe, but in the meantime, it's going to save so many lives. You can't dismiss a technology just because it might not have a 100% success rate. If that's your metric, then people would never be allowed to drive.
