List prices have been increasing as they have since WWII. However the bar for getting grant aid catches more and more families. College has become a private wealth and income tax. If you save $1m it will cost your kids $1m. Tuition has gotten to the point that even the mass affluent without assets are getting aid. Today if you have a $200k household income but instead have that $1m tied up in home equity and retirement accounts, it will only cost $50k per year or a discount off list price of about $600k for two kid families making $200k a year. I'm not saving a dime for college since my kids will be punished for it. I've paid off my house and I'm maximizing every available retirement account.
