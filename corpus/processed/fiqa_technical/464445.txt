"Educating everyone is a cultural investment, but not necessarily a good fiscal investment. (for the govt.) 200 years ago, being able to read and perform arithmetic pretty much guaranteed you an ok job, because it was a rare skillset. The government decided that everyone being able to read and do basic maths would be a good thing, so they force us all to pay for it and they force us all to attend school. So, most of the country has a basic education. That's obviously a good thing, but it doesn't guarantee everyone in the country a good job. If 1000's of people have the same skillset and are all applying for the same job, it's impossible to differentiate job candidates. In the job market, a skill that everyone has is effectively valueless. The same thing is happening with college. We have tons of college graduates that are all applying for the exact same jobs, and we (as a society) have produced more people to do that small group of jobs and haven't produced any people to do other jobs. Somewhat ironically immigrant workers do a lot of the work we should be doing ourselves, but we all went to college and all want to do the same ""good/high paying/etc"" jobs. And there's too many of us and not very much demand for the skills we can deliver. So, giving secondary educations to even more people, wouldn't be a bad thing in and of itself. But it wouldn't help anyone find work."
