Thank you! I've worked for two big companies that made the change and I now cringe when asked to use PowerPoint, Outlook or Excel. The level of collaboration with Gsuite is unparalleled. Plus, once you learn the small details, Gsuite basically provides the same exact tools with additional functionality. Sounds like this company is maturing.
