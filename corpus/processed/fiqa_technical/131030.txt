Comcast is doing all this twitter advertising about how they won't throttle, block, prioritize, yadda. All that was a stipulation of their merger with NBC. Those requirements end next year. If Title II goes away, like they won't throttle Netflix and block other services that compete with theirs? What's to stop them? It won't even be the same do AT&T - doubt *this* Justice Department will impose any pro-consumer regulations.
