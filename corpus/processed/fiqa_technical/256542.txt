They are wrong. If they offer an FSA, they must abide by the rules regarding FSA eligible expenses, plain and simple. They can offer a lower limit than the general maximum ($5K/yr?) and they can allow a grace period on expenses, or not. But, they must allow reimbursements for reimbursable items. Medical Insurance premiums are included. See this comprehensive list. On the IRS web site, Pub 969 discusses FSAs at a higher level and indicates that Publication 502 has the detailed list of reimbursable expenses. Medical insurance is listed. I offer this chain so one can find the data directly from the IRS and not claim that Wikipedia might not be accurate. At this point you need to decide how far you want to go with your benefits department on this. Do they offer a copy of what they claim is the accepted list of reimbursables?
