So Idaho is bringing back slavery? Non-compete agreements, in a democratic and free world are criminal. Preventing someone from plying their trade and getting paid more for it, is what free-enterprise is all about. Maybe companies need to focus more on providing improved salary and benefits and staff welfare, rather than indenturing them? If companies want to enforce an extended non-compete period, then they should pay for it - pay the employees salary for the entire period of non-compete. THAT should be the law!
