There's only one thing that will kill Walmart and Target: Walmart and Target. Like just about every other corporation, they're going to find every way to trim costs to make more profit. And those ways are going to make people shop elsewhere. Walmart wasn't always known for hosting the dregs of society, at one point people liked shopping there because of all of the people they had working there, answering questions, helping out, keeping the place tidy & clean. Now they're often shitholes. It's like they're taking pages out of the K-Mart playbook.
