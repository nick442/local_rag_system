Welll put. IMO, the best way to dump the Fed is to nationalize it, turning it into a new credit bank. The best recent model for what we need is the Reconstruction Finance Corporation of FDR, which lent $50 billion dollars during the depression in the thirties. Credit has to be directed into real physical wealth, like a new high speed rail system. These kind of investments pay off the associated debt by increasing real wealth, not by what you site correctly, is money for money's sake.
