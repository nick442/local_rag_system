This is a very good plan for our current fiscal situation. The problem as I see it, is that the die-hard Tea Partiers who want to curb gov't spending, bristle whenever you add the DOD to the equation. I also like the idea of giving those federal programs that would be better handled on the State level back to the States (ie HUD, Dept of Ed, ect..). You can still keep the cabinet level positions but allow them to sponsor and provide grants for research and advancements in those areas without attempting to micromanage them from Washington.
