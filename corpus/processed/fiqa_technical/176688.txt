These services are immensely popular in big cities where grocery shopping time is scarce and a lot of younger people are foregoing car ownership. The price is a little high (base package is $60/week for 3 meals for 2 people) but provides good value if you're willing to cook the food. I think their biggest hurdle though is retention. These services are fun for the first few months until they start to feel like a chore. And if you don't end up cooking the food you throw out a ton compared getting takeout on your way home from work.
