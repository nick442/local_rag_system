I agree. But I'm wondering why Japan is in such a unique position compared to most (all?) other counties. They print money yet suffer from deflation for three decades. And the quality of life is amazing even in the simplest towns. They have their Japanese made air-condition, playing their Japanese made console, eating a cheap and amazingly good nutritious meal at home or at a cheap isakaya/diner. And every year their money buys them more than last year.
