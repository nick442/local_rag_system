"It is measured in US dollars. The US cannot just print the money because that would cause inflation. Remember that money is really just a convenient placeholder for the barter system. Creating more money regardless of whether there is more value in the economy (work, resources, etc.) is a very bad idea, and doing so has collapsed the economies of many countries. Debt increasing means that the US owes other countries more money. So yes, they are receiving more money from other countries, but the US has to pay it all back with interest eventually. The US government spends more money than it receives in taxes. To decrease the debt, spending needs to decrease and/or taxes need to increase. Many countries lend to the US. One of the biggest is China. These countries do so because of interest -- the US pays back more money than it gets lent, so the lending countries make a profit. If China suddenly called in all its debt to the US, this would severely damage the world economy. China's biggest trading partner is the US, so it has no interest in harming the US this way; it would harm itself. Additionally, the US would probably refuse to pay it (not to mention that it can't), and then China would lose all the money it ""invested"" in the US. It would benefit no one."
