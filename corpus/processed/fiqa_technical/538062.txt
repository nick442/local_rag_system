"I'm a ""new"" (last 2 years) homeowner. For me, at least, benefits of owning far outweigh renting. $8000 tax credit for the first time homebuyer, a massive deduction every year for your tax return, the option to rent out rooms to offset the large majority of my mortgage payment, and the real estate trend indicating that the value of my house *should* increase over time. I think that if one has the means to buy in the current environment rather than renting, they certainly should. You get no return on your money if you rent."
