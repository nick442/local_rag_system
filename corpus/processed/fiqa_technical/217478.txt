"The loan is the loan, the down payment is not part of the loan. The principle amount owed on the loan at the beginning of the loan is the amount of the loan. If your loan amount is $390,000 then that's below the ""jumbo"" classification. Your down payment is irrelevant. Lenders may want or require 20% (or any other amount) down so the loan will meet certain ""loan to value"" ratio requirements. In the case of real estate the lenders in general want a 20% down side cushion before you're ""upside down"" (owe more than the home is worth). This is not unique to homes and is common in many secured lending instruments; like cars for example."
