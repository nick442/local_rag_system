"There are a number of companies that will issue pre-paid chip and pin Mastercards this is probably the easiest way to deal with the issue. Most of them are limited to UK residents but with a very quick google I found this one http://public.neteller.com/content/en_US/cards_index.htm which seems to be open to US residents. I have no experience of using this company but when I googled ""chip and pin usa pre paid credit card"" they came up."
