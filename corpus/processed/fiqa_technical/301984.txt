"My study times were as follows: * L1: Started studying for the December test in mid-September; spent approximately 110 hours total studying Schwesser materials. * L2: Failed the first time w/120 hrs of studying from Schwesser. 2nd time around started in February (of the year of the test), spent about 130 hours studying straight from CFAI. * L3: Started in February of the test year again, approximately 130 hours of studying CFAI material. I almost never studied more than 2 hours straight at a time, but it was consistently 2 hrs a day - that matters. How much you study is up to you. You need to study until you can confidently do the problems they're going to ask (they actually telegraph these questions directly to you if you study the CFAI materials). The number of hours spent studying, outside of the construct of ""do you understand this and can you replicate it,"" is irrelevant. Good luck - PS I had approximately 8 years of front-office experience as a sell-side market maker and buy-side execution trader before starting L1. I had absolutely no understanding of corporate finance, financial reporting/analysis, and very little understanding of equity valuation before embarking on the coursework."
