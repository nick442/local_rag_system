"I'm a SVP at a wealth management firm - I pay my admins extremely well (between $90k and $100k base + benefits + bonuses) and I expect a lot in return. Certain traits that I find critical include (but are not limited to): -punctuality -organizational abilities -time management -multitasking -willingness to learn -ability to take action without explicit directions in some situations -PRIVACY (with clients, internally, etc..) -gregariousness -""thick skin"" (sometimes people say things they don't mean in the heat of the moment) -written and oral communication skills -strong work ethic -too many others to list For example, I have 2 admins in their late 50s and are essentially superannuated employees - 1 of them resents the fact that I'm 37, and believes since she has been here longer than me she doesn't have to follow my directions. The other has never mentioned anything about age, etc..when it was announced that I would assume the role of CEO in the next 2-3 years, who do you think got nervous? My point is, be professional and treat everyone with respect. I would have to imagine it's difficult to climb the corporate ladder while being insubordinate or condescending. When I talk to prospective clients (or current clients) I refer to them as ""team members"" and tell people that THEY are the ones that make everything happen. Neither one of them came from a financial background, but ""hard work respects hard work"". If you have any questions, please feel free to ask me. Good luck!"
