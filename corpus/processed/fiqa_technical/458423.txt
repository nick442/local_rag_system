"It makes little sense from that perspective. The owners are the ""very large"" consumers of public goods such as National defense, not the legal entity that the owners make in order to create wealth. And you can't tax dividends any more than any other capital gains made within the corporation, otherwise the corporation would be stupid to ever disperse dividends instead of buying back shares. Tax the rich their due share on the profits they made after investing, or just set up a progressive consumption tax that taxes the rich for what they spend. I don't care. Just don't over-tax people for doing things you actually want them to do, like re-invest."
