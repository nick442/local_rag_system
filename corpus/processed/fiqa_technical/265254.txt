KB served lends itself to optimization in a bad way (serving content as large as one can get away with). Personally I think models that work well for monetization without ads are those that start with free content and later donations (e.g. Patreon, reddit gold) or those that start with free content and ask for payment for more similar content later (e.g. first album is free but later albums by the same artist cost money). They keep the supplier honest because people can tell if the content is crap before they pay. Of course those who want to sell crappy content will resist any such model.
