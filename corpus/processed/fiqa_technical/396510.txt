">entitled Your entire comment, dude. what? It's getting what the market dictates you're worth, not ""entitlement."" An extremely talented developer who can find work for any firm on earth is going to have a lot of power in the employer-employee negotiations because of his or her extremely hard work and exemplary performance throughout life. What does being physically uncomfortable have to do with literally anything anyone is talking about? It's like you're trying to say twenty different things, and none of them make any sense or are related to the discussion at all."
