$12/hr is just what you pay the employee, it isn't the sole cost of employing someone. There's payroll taxes, insurance, accident coverage, etc. There's also the cost of efficiency due to poor employees, training periods, personal issues, and the costs of business due to employee mistakes. There's liability in the event of injury, discrimination, sexual harassment, etc, and the simple fact that employees can be a real pain in the ass. If you can take a machine that is the size of a McDonald's kitchen or smaller, feed it raw or minimally processed ingredients, and have it deliver a product which is comparable or better than their current shitty product, and have it replace just two $12/hr shifts at a location open for 18 hrs a day, we're talking well over $157k in labor savings a year, replaced by repair and cleaning costs. Give it a couple years to pay down the machine, and that's a major potential equipment budget. What part of that doesn't make economic sense?
