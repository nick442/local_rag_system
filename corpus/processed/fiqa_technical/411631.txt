"Upvote for sense. We've all seen our fair share of ""devoted"" colleagues who put in a ton of hours - but we're not assembling widgets. You cannot create more, process better, or troubleshoot faster by working extra hours. The study of creative work especially is showing that the mindset of the baby boomers - the manufacturing generation - doesn't apply at all to the creative work done now. So that colleague working 70 hours a week; that might be 30 hours of shit work. It's unlikely they were working at their best capacity. They're not only shooting themselves in the foot, but also their colleagues and the products they're working on."
