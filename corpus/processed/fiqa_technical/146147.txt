I agree to an extent. You make good points. I'm still not at a state where I would trust our incompetent government to efficiency allocate and run a healthcare system sponsored by taxpayers or users. I assume each European nation has its own plan or system. To extrapolate such over a country with a population and sprawl of the U.S. seems much more difficult. To be honest, I'm at a loss of how to solve the problem. Fighting the population bubble, global sluggishness, corruption, government waste, and populace inequality has really forced me out of politics. Sorry for the demoralized response, but I cannot say you are right or wrong at this point. And frankly, I'm starting to realize it doesn't matter.
