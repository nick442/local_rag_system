When I said that unbundling is a good thing for consumers, I was implicitly assuming that the market is competitive. For example, consider how the unbundling of various services in the airline industry has made air travel much more affordable. I think that the same can happen in the telecom industry. I agree with you that if the telecom industry is oligopolistic then the customer can get screwed, but this can happen whether services are bundled or unbundled. Oligopolies are bad for the customer in general.
