Thanks for the suggestion guys, but it won't make sense to only give the money to D. Cuz, if I don't give the money to B, why would he give me any further work. It was all cuz of him that I got work in the first place. The job level and difficulty was pretty easy, I asked D and he was happy to do the work for $500.
