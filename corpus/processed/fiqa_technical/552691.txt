">Make sense, those willing to pay a large price premium on a lap top would probably be willing to spend more on a hotel. And just as likely they would not be WANTING to reserve a room at the Motel 6, much less Ma & Pa Kettle's ""rooms 4 rent"" fleabag motel. If you're a ""brand name & image"" consumer when it comes to consumers (the days when the Mac OS/GUI was pragmatically/functionally ""better"" than other products is long past), then you are probably into buying brand names and ""image"" in other products/services as well."
