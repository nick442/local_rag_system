Just came back from the IBM Smarter Computing forum in Ryebrook, and this was one of the more interesting parts of the presentations. The steps that have been made are already enormous, and yet there is a long way to go. Watson is one side of the equation - the software approach to cognitive function. I think the far more interesting side is the hardware approach. A system that does not function in a linear manner, that uses no little or no power to maintain states, just spiking when reacting to stimuli. They demonstrated a 256 neuron network that could change states bases on optical input that was quite interesting, not because of its sophistication, but rather the exact opposite - extremely low power compared to conventional processing (although still more than 40 times the draw of human neurons) and lots of fuzziness in terms of its reactions to change. Watson is very cool, but I think ultimately, linear programmed systems will fall behind the parallel approach.
