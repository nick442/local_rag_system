For local retailers you will need to visit the store. For national retail chains you will need to get in contact with their purchasing departments. Either way, have a solid product with a good presentation. A lot of cold calls and sales presentations are ahead of you so master your elevator pitch as well as your 10-15 minute presentation. Best of luck to you!
