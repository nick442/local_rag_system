"I think it's very reasonable to expect a person to back up a claim they've made. Telling someone to ""go to Google"" seems rather lazy to me, or at least promoting extremely poor conversation skills. Or do you not agree that someone should support their own claims? Your suggestion doesn't even make sense, to be honest. You're telling someone to check someone else's claim using a website that both confirms and contradicts the claim. >Reading usernames would definitely be a valuable skill for you to practice going forward. Thanks for repeating what I said, I guess?"
