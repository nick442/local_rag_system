"> . A us ceo will pay more in income taxes than a 1000 factory workers. From quick google searches, average auto worker make about $35-40 an hour, meaning they pay about $20,000 a year in taxes. $20,000 * 1,000 = $20million Ford CEO reportedly gets about that in gross compensation, which he probably pays closer to the capital gains tax rate for (~20%). Though I'm not sure why you are trying to start an argument here. You said you were considering ""buying a car from a foreign manufacturer"" and I simply pointed out that the car in question was manufactured here in America."
