People were predicting a big market crash last year. The fact is no one knows when it will happen, its really just speculation. Yes, there will be a crash but when? Idk, people say every 8 years from past history but who knows with all the technological advancements. Plus the last real crash was 9 years ago (2008) when Congress rejected a bank bail out plan which caused mass panic.
