If you are going to complain about US debt at least look at the budget. We spent roughly half the budget on defense+wars+intelligence and another half on Medical problems. Welfare, SS are no where near as significant. How the hell do these idiots expect to fix the budget if they ignore what constitutes more than 80% of it?
