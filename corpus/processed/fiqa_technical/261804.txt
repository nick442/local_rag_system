"Investing is balancing the desire for return against the various risks that your money is faced with. There's also a recognition that an investment will be in place for some extended period of time. Speculation is seeking short-term maximum return, without protecting yourself against risk. ""Speculation"" or ""Speculators"" is often thrown out as a pejorative, but you need speculation to have a healthy market."
