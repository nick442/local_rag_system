This is what happens when you privatize the costs of maternity leave. The law is that maternity leave exists and it covers all employment. Why then ,is it not paid by the state with taxes on the employer, but instead paid by the employer on a case by case basis. This means that it's possible for one employer to have more expenses on maternity leave than another employer thus incentivizing not hiring potential mothers. Edit: We know how much maternity leave costs businesses each year. So just add that extra sum to the taxes paid by employers and release them from having to pay people on maternity leave.
