A bunch of places in no particular order and not any real regularity, often what I get links to on twitter etc. The Economist, Telegraph, Guardian, the odd bit from the NYT and FT or the New Statesman/Spectator. I usually browse the BBC website and I follow a bunch of colmunists/bloggers. I really recommend Tim Harford the FT's Undercover Economist (all of his columns are also published on his personal site so you can get around the paywall easily). However my best understanding of the euro crisis actually comes from radio/podcasts. Particularly the BBC Radio 4/World Service More or Less: Behind the Stats (which is hosted by Tim Harford and about economics and stats and numbers in the news) and NPR's Planet Money who are both covering the situation excellently. Also Today (and sometimes PM) on Radio 4 usually by the short best of podcasts and other podcasts now and then. I particularly like More or Less because 1.it has a very irreverent tone and 2. as well as just being regularly interesting and brilliant it regularly holds politicians factual claims or commonly quoted to scrutiny explaining what they are saying means, if it is correct and they can say it or if it is wrong or misleading etc etc.
