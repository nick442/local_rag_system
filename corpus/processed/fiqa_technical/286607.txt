Saying the government bailed out the entire financial system is just completely foolish and ignorant. The list of institutions (with the amount) that got bailed out is public. I will let you do the research because along the way you might gain some well needed knowledge on that matter. I'll two example of financial institution that didn't get bailed out, Berkshire Hathaway and Lehman Brothers. Writing a letter is not my style. To show my gratitude I rather try educate people like you who do not understand the bailout program and why it was such an important decision. PS: I'm still waiting on your answer for my two questions I asked in my previous post. ''Intelligence is real but for some, it's just a fantasy'' =Winston Churchill
