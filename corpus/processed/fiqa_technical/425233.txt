"Why not badger the person who actually wrote that phrase in the article's title? [Here you go](https://qz.com/author/akshatqz/) there is everything you need to contact the person who wrote this article, and it's title: ""A simple way the rest of the world could punish Trump for quitting the Paris climate agreement"" It's quite likely OP's title for this post was meant to be a shorter, simpler version of the articles actual title, so why bother them about it? They just rephrased the title of the article in a way that still accurately describes the article, even if the article itself is based on false assumptions. If you want to badger anyone, go badger the person who said it first."
