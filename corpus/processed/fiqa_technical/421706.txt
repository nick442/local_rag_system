I work in corporate credit specializing in financial fraud in Asia/CIS. Had one project where the team went full Wolf of Wall Street on the client's payroll. Lots of corruption. It's probably more widespread and open here compared to the US due to weaker legal system. It looks very professional for most, but once you get very close to people who make the decisions, you start seeing and hearing things.
