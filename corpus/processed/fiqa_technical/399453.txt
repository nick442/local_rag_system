"I was never much of a customer but I legitimately had someone feel insulted that I would stop into a market basket to buy cigarettes during the boycott and threaten to stop speaking with me because I was being ""ignorant about the situation."" Small town pride is no joke around here and word travels fast. I grew up shopping at market basket and slowly stopped because there isn't any closer than Walmart. So trust me after this display of integrity, I have no quarrels with contributing 30 more minutes to my grocery shopping commute."
