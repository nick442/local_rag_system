Investments are always a safe bet after they've proven themselves. If you (or anyone else) would have been so sure about Tesla's success, you'd mortgaged your house, emptied your 401k and maxed out your cards in order to buy stock. But throughout its life, Tesla has looked like a coin flip, and therefore regretting not having invested in it is useless. For the record I got in at $24, sold at $92, got in at $150 again, sold at $192, got in again at $210, sold at $290 and now am short through puts at $375. I was fairly confident it would do well, but I never put more than 5% of my portfolio on a single stock because being confident is not being certain.
