Bitcoin exhibits the network effect so you would have to expect that it's price will mimic an S-curve. Of course for equity and debt investors it looks like a bubble within their asset classes. The only way you could say if bitcoin is becoming frothy is if you had a very large pool of people answering surveys with why they are buying bitcoin and how much they own and plan to invest.
