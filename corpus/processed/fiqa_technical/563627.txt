This sounds like it makes no difference if you behave in the same manner (i.e. take the same vacation time). For example, say you work 1 hour and take 1 hour of vacation and the current hourly rate is $1/hour. You would make $2. Using your formula, new rate = 1* (1+1)/1 = 1*2 = $2. So they would pay you $2 for the hour you worked and then you would take the 1 hour of vacation with no pay. If you plan on taking LESS vacation than used in the formula, you make more money. If you plan on taking MORE vacation, you make less money.
