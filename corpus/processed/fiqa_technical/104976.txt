"> those of us who showed the good judgement If you call going $80,000 into debt for a ""professional certification"" (4-year degree) that verifies that you've read Kant or Marx from front to back ""good judgement"" then I guess so. Lost in this whole thing is the fact that our college educated jobless want factory jobs in the first place. These guys are looking for veterains because they have been vetted by the military, they've proven some ability adhere to a heirarchy/follow orders, and have shown an ability to work in a dangerous environment. If you can do that, I am sure they would love to hire you."
