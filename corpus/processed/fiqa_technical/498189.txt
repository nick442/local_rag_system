>It shouldn't have had to go to court. The plaintiff brought the case to court to end the ongoing extortion for others, not because he needed to fight the claim. It is obviously in the public domain and the judgement even said so, but it is still cheaper for small time authors to pay the licensing fee than to defend from a false claim which is why the Doyle estate kept trying this stunt.
