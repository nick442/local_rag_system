"McDonalds has some more expensive items, but their ""Dollar Menu"" is ridiculously popular and supposedly a huge draw. They've been trying to get rid of it for years because it's really hard to get anything decent for $1, but it's just too popular to cut. (According to the random articles I've read about it.) Other places don't really have anything like it. At McDonalds you can get two $1.xx cheeseburgers and fill up pretty good for the cost of going to a vending machine. While I very rarely go to any of these places, I do not agree that food is bad. Tastes are subjective and what you get used to eating tastes good to you. I remember that I used to absolutely love Taco Bell. Then - after a few years of not going there - I went there and found everything to be absolutely disgusting. But for a time, I thought it was the best stuff out there and there are a lot of people who like so called ""fast food"". I do think the overarching point is true; customer tastes are fluid. In the past 10-ish years, we've come to see a lot of ""gourmet"" burger places spreading like wildfire, for example. But as long as fast food is cheap, they will continue to fill the market for cheap food."
