Those surveys suck. I've seen them jump all over the place. Not too long ago the northeast one was way up. Real live recessions don't usually happen unless the yield curve is inverted. This muddling along crap is pretty characteristic of a recovery from a financial panic. Lots of slow deleveraging fed by easy money. I'd be really surprised to see a real recession. I do think corporate earnings are going to start missing estimates. But that is more about some mean reversion than anything else.
