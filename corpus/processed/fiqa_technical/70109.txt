"Without divulging too many specifics. Net income is 73k. Total income is 136k. Filed as an S-Corp. Using Quickbooks to classify expenses etc. I know its not much information but I don't know what to look out for, like ""whoa, net income is 73k, you gotta spend that!"" I have a CPA but isn't offering much in the terms of ""help"" and ""explanation"". Thanks for your time!"
