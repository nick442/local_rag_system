I was unemployed for 9 months (have been gainfully employed again for 2 months now). I'm in digital marketing so I did some social media volunteer work for a high profile non-profit and put it in my resume. While there were a number of factors that helped me get a job, this did in part contribute to it as I demonstrated that I'm actually interested in my career path and staying current. In addition, my work was tangible and public, which was a huge plus as I had a portfolio. So I would highly recommend volunteering for a local organization within your area of expertise to show that your skills are current. In speaking with HR people, skills atrophy is one of the main reasons why longer term unemployed people are not as attractive.
