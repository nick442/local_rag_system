"George Washington doesn't support your right to brew whiskey in your own still. Washington raised a militia, and personally led the army to steal money from hard-working American farmers. He says, ""You didn't brew that..The Continental Army fought for your independence and now you have to pay it back."" George Washington. Tax and spend liberalism at its worst. [This message paid for by Americans for a Democratic Republic.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whiskey_Rebellion)"
