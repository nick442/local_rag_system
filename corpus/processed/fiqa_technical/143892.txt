Very odd site, it seems extremely useful but then there are douchey users with superiority complexes that may or may not be real, lmao. Good point the manager made, cost of living in NY is damn expensive and unless you get aggressive with all the other schmucks there and move up you're not doing yourself a huge favor. I'd take the guaranteed cash, regular hours, and strong possibility of moving high up in the smaller company. Although both options aren't want I'd want to be doing for the rest of my life.
