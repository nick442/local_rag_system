No way. The CFA is comprehensive, but finance as subject matter isn't very difficult. I am an econ/econometric major in the CFA program with zero finance/accounting background. I started the program without know assets = liabilities + equity. Takes more time, and is a larger commitment, but unless you are working 12 hours a day, if you are diligent, you should have no major issues.
