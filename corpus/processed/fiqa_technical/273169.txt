All the mirrored departments ( Marketing, Sales, HR, Facilities, etc.) between banks and tech companies will have a similar layout in terms of roles; the major differences between them would be operations. Operations in a bank is populated by finance/econ/accounting majors. Operations in a tech startup are populated by STEM. You wouldn't expect them to be identical, and the differences between them will affect the overall demographics of a company. It's a far cry to say wall street is intentionally hiring women and silicon valley is intentionally not when there's a disparity in the availability of women for those roles coming from the education system.
