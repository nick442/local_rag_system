I just opened and received my first credit card - Discover IT - I'm a student. How do I do my best with this card? I plan to only use it for gas and groceries and to pay it off every month by the due date. Is this all I need to know to be successful? Also I got a report with it that said my current credit score is 665. I don't know how I have a credit score, all I've ever paid with is cash and my debit card. Can anyone enlighten me? Thanks!
