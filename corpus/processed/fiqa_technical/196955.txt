Literally only bought Motorola for the patents. Sold to Lenovo without them. Also, they're only buying the HTC smartphone manufacturing devision - not the brand. Probably want to be able to manufacture next year's pixels in house, and this is easier than building up an entire manufacturing devision yourself. The acquisition is getting my hopes up that they're coming out with their own SoC that's been rumored forever within the next year or two.
