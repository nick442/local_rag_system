As I understand it, the correct price is any point between the minimum the seller is willing to accept and the maximum the buyer is willing to pay. These values are influenced by a number of factors, including market conditions, cost of production and immediate need. There's also a sense of fairness and expectation that influences these numbers. People don't want to pay a much higher price or accept a much lower price than they think the other party *should* agree to. For example, in the event of a sudden actual or anticipated shortage in some commodity consumer good, say.. gasoline, it would make sense for sellers to raise the price significantly. In the short term, consumers of gasoline are very price-insensitive and most will pay more than double the usual price to obtain it. This behavior is commonly seen as unfair on the part of the seller - to the point that certain variations of it are illegal in some jurisdictions. Economists would describe it as rational. Oddly, people don't seem to be as upset about buyers offering low prices in the event of a sudden increase in highly motivated sellers. When people do tend to get upset is if the buyers have a profit motive; they know the price decrease is temporary and are willing to buy and hold the asset to make a profit later. Even so, it seems to me that it's much rarer for such behavior to be illegal. The underlying objection, as far as I can tell is to what is perceived as greed.
