I understand what you're saying, but to me the circumstances are different. No scientist was or is predicting overnight calamity due to climate change. Predictions are for long-term change. Various economics 'experts' on reddit, however, have been predicting imminent collapse for a long time. Krugman is also not saying to run a deficit forever; he follow Keynes, who said spend when times are tough and save when times are good.
