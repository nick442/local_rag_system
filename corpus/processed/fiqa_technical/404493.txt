"Are these people making min wage dying en mass? No? Then they are supported. I don't want to sound crude, but there really isn't a profession on earth where you don't have to rough it out for a few years. Life's tough. The ""abundance"" of min wage jobs you speak of are either not as abundant as you think relative to the demand or the minimum wage is already too high relative to the demand. Either way my scenario in my previous comment holds true- do things the right way and you will be all set to make more money. Staff and wage bloating are all a result of garunteed loans given to optimistic, short-sighted youths. Without the steady flow of these kids who can suddenly afford college there would be no bloating. I agree on the rest, and the answer is accountability. we should start with holding people accountable to the high-interest loan they took out 4 years before they hand any income."
