I'm quite aware of your point and it doesn't hold water for me, for the reasons I already explained. If someone came in saying Amazon is a company that sells dogs, and I say no they don't, I don't feel the need to cite a source, even if one is available, because it's a known truth and if they want to argue, they can look it up and find out they're wrong. It's not incumbent upon me to hold your hand.
