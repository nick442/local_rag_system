This was during undergrad. If you are in undergrad, get a high GPA and study finance and accounting. Try going the investment banking or fortune 500 internal finance/M&A route. Or if you like the broker idea, interview for private wealth management at legit firms (merrill, goldman, citi, etc). If you absolutely want to be more of a broker, try interviewing for merrill lynch, wells fargo advisers, edward jones, etc. to see if you can handle it. Even at merrill you are basically cold calling, but you have a legit firm at your back with the opportunity to build a legitimate business. In general though, these cold calling broker jobs are hard to stay with. If you aren't cut out of it, you wont last more than a few months.
