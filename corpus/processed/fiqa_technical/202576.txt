I think the biggest issue you'll have is getting a loan larger than the price of the car. The lenders calculate the rate they'll be charging based on the risk of the loan. If you were to default on a car, they can repo your car and recover the approximate value of the collateral. With a loan to essentially purchase securities, they would likely charge much more.
