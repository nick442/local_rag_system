Are mortgages always sold for less than the remaining principal? No, they're almost always sold for more than that. The buyer will take a loss if the homeowner pays off the loan immediately, but that's very unlikely. The buyer is hoping that the owner will payoff the loan as scheduled and they'll make a tidy profit from the interest charged. The originator now makes their profit immediately and has their capital back so they can make more loans.
