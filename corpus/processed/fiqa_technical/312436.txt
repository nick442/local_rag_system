You said all public employees should be required to fly coach. I never claimed more than that in my response. I simply pointed out why this was a silly thing to get worked up over. You didn't explain what you did. Nor does it matter. Again, tax dollars and union dues are two very different things. Just like private company profit is different. You can have an opinion on tax dollars. Union practices are none of your business unless you're paying dues.
