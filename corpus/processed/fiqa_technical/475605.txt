For the truck, start out with getting magnetic signs made. One for the front upper/ sides of the box and doors and potentially for the back door. You can do this relatively cheap compared to a full out custom paint job. Another option is just company and contact info in electrical tape. The guy that commented saying give 5 business cards to every client is correct; I generate a lot of leads this way and get a lot of work. I just freelance about doing whatever with a few main gigs but it's working for me so far. Craigslist and simple door to door flyers are also a decent option.
