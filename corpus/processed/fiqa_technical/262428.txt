> Do u find issue with a person having a beer or a couple glasses of wine every other day? To some extent, yes. Because they are using it as an escape rather than actually getting help. If you can't unwind naturally, theres an issue that needs to be worked on. With that said, its not a huge deal either as long as it doesn't affect others. Like you don't drive drunk or become annoying to others. > Same applies to mj most users arent getting completely blasted everyday and i have sources to prove it if youre interested. The issue become they think its okay to drink and drive, smoke in your face, act stupid when they get high, etc.. There are zero rules and restrictions. > Not trying to be rude but you havent even done your research on mj laws in your own state. Prop 64 is almost identical to drinking laws so you're absolutely incorrect here I don't see the cops doing anything about people smoking on the street, etc.. Sure they say you can't drive impaired, but I don't see people getting in trouble for it > Youre right but my point was alcohol is perfectly legal and offers no medicinal value isn't that a bit ridiculous? Sure, but I didn't make that rule. > You'd greatly benefit from educating yourself on the matter of mj. There's a reason why many conservatives also support mj legalzation including myself. Id be willing to send u some credible information if you're interested. I appreciate the offer and I don't think you're wrong about anything you said, but in a place like Los Angeles, you see a ton of troublemakers and trash smoking and causing trouble or being loud and stupid. Much more so than with alcohol from what I have seen. I think a lot of it is the actual people, but if it wasn't so available, it wouldn't be so bad. That's the issue I have with it.
