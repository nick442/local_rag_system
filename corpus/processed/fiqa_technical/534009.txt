Well, the reason its that way is that Americans have been deprived of large chunks of the information they would need to figure the situation out and fix it. For example, right wing speaking points mix facts in with lies with the intent of creating a desired result, disgust in government which discourages people from taking any nterest in or of getting involved in fixing it. Democratic speaking points are slightly better because the Democratic rank and file is often better informed in certain areas than Republicans so some unscrupulous Democrats demonize Republicans. Behind the scenes, I suspect they are to some extent pretending to disagree more than actually disagreeing. The fact is, both parties are neoliberal as heck and neither at this point has the country's best interests at heart. Which is what you're seeing. Its a side effect of the concentration of wealth caused by accelerating technological growth. It will get worse as more and more jobs succumb to automation.
