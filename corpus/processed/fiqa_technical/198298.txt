"> Lets say Bob was spending 60k in Indy, saving 20k/yr. > Total San Jose / mid-valley COL: 15k + 15k + 11k + 65k + 42k = 130k. **You've just demonstrated my point, and then some.** That's even factoring in the reduce QOL you've given ""Bob"". > I'm sorry if I upset you The brazen ignorance is annoying, not upsetting. You're spreading misinformation because apparently you've forgotten how to read. The poster threw out a number of 120k in San Fran. I said this was like 60k somewhere else. You called that bullshit, and now you just showed that 60k living costs in ""Indy"" are equal to 130k in San Fran with a lower quality of life. QED."
