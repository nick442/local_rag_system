I've spent a lot of time in Sweden. Hard-working and educated are among the top words I would use to describe my Swedish friends. Spent some time in Denmark and Finland too and it appears to be the same there. I don't think you can say that about many counties. Next country over, Russia, one of the top words is cynical. You won't find more cynical people about taking and giving to those who claim greater need after the horrendously failed experiment. Also I don't think Sweden is as socialist as people make them out to be, although I have to admit I haven't researched it much. I've just spent a few months there.
