I've worked on numerous restructurings in the o&g space. I assure you that bankruptcy is not a magical process of wiping away debt. It's been extremely common over the last 3 years in the energy industry. It'd be far more aggressive to say that a business is valued at $5 billion when in reality they have $5 billion in debt that traded at pennies on the dollar.
