You're saying that medallions aren't profitable but that they're selling for $1 Million because they're *liquid*!? OK you might need to go read about discounted cash flows or something because you do not know what drives the value of a business Because that's what Medallions are - they aren't a cost of doing business, they're the price of buying a business. Which is high because the business is profitable If you're not seeing the profits then you have the city to blame for that: they're going to the medallion owners
