Thanks AMC for looking out for me and trying to keep me from being disappointed in the future! It looks like AMC's threat is to withdraw from the Moviepass program thinking that people will continue to patronize AMC and forego Moviepass. I cant speak for anyone else but if that is the case then I would tell AMC to go fuck themselves and just use Moviepass at other theaters. This reeks of desperation by AMC at it's stinkiest.
