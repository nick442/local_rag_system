Plus healthcare/dental/vision That's an additional $6,000/year (bringing her wage to $17.13/hour) for one individual. I'm not sure if Walmart covers family plans though but if they do, that's $14,400/year for a family plan (bringin her wage to $21.50/hour). You always need to account for the benefits of a job. Taking a position that pays $14/hour with a full family plan is better than taking a $20/hour job with no health insurance.
