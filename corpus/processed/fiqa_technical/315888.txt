It could also be that Rovio already had a couple of investors, and if they're failing to make any returns, they could be holding an IPO to return some money to the shareholders. Similar to SNAP. Wouldn't surprise me either, Angry Birds seemed like it had a ton of potential as a brand at its apex and went nowhere.
