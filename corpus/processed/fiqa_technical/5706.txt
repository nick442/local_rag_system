You're exactly right and I agree with you completely. Just to add, another important fact is that autos simply don't represent as large or sticky of an asset on peoples' personal balance sheets. A house often represents a significant leverage on income, but cars are a fraction of the price, significantly more liquid, and purchased with the expectation of depreciation so there's much less incentive to over leverage (as opposed to buying a house and reselling when the market rises). All of these aspects naturally limit the amount of damage that a broad auto loan default could have and limits the autocorrelation of the default of one loan to another. I think people just liked the movie too much and are searching for the next *big short*.
