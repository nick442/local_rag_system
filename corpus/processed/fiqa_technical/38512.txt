"0% is too low, 100% is too high. There is some optimal number between the two where we get good economic growth without being overly punishing to billionaires (unless you want to just take everything from them and are pro-dictatorship and are ok with both Obama and Trump deciding what to do with 100% of your money). If we're under that optimal number and want to move it up, people will say you're stealing from the rich even though you're actually moving to a more optimal number. If we're over that number and want to move it down, people will sarcastically say ""Yeah, won't somebody think of the billionaires?!"" even though you're actually moving to a more optimal number. It's economists, not politicians or talking heads who are best qualified to choose what that number should be. We can at least narrow it down then to between 50%-80% for high income earners: https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/4263739/mankiw_optimaltaxationtheory.pdf?sequence=2"
