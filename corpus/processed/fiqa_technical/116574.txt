Not to be an asshole but the fact you are even asking the above tells me any form of financial service may not be for you. How the fuck can you be licensed and not have a basic understanding of what it means? And even further, that rules for doing/not doing are much more determined by individual jobs and firm rules than by some industry exam. You have confirmed my belief that our industry licensing is equivalent to a food handler's card, thank you.
