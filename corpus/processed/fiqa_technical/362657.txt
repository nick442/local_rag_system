There was an [article](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/01/making-it-in-america/8844/) a couple of months back. One of the major take-aways from the article was that, for the auto parts factory, their line for whether to buy a robot or use humans for a task came at 2 years. If the robot could replace enough workers to pay for itself in 2 years, the robot won. If you're talking about a factory operating 24 hours a day, a robot costing less than 6 man years of salary and capable of operating 24 hours a day for 2 years would win and 3 workers would lose. Personally, it seems like there's always more work that could be done, and people should be looking for ways to move higher up the value tree - either into tasks that are hard to automate, or into roles that accelerate the automation. If, as a society, we're able to free people up from the basic tasks needed for survival, we can progress faster on other things. It's not like this is the first time that there's been a revolution in how labor is allocated. It used to be everybody farmed their own land for survival, then techniques in farming got better and some farmed land while others started making other things to trade for food. Then crops started producing things like cotton and people would work to turn the cotton into things to trade for food or housing or whatever, and people specialized, then machines started farming and more people were in factories, and then more people in factories with machines, etc. If you asked someone from a time when everybody worked their own land for survival to look what modern people have, they might look and wonder how you eat when you don't have enough land to grow food on.
