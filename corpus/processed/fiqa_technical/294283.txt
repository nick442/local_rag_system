"It's like the lady said, ""It's not the size that counts, honey -- it's the wiggle behind it."" Or to be more precise in application of metaphor, it's not the amount of money but *where it goes* that matters. Currency is like blood: It's supposed to circulate, but when it pools into large pockets, well, that's a good sign you're dead."
