"Well the only 2 times I've been scammed were Chinese. A smartphone scam on swappa and these smart LED bulbs on Indiegogo. I'll never trust a store front once one of their sellers can get away with that. With Swappa, items are publicly visible before they're verified and with Indiegogo they say you're investing in an ""idea."" When the merchant says there is a tangible product and that it will be shipped, it's not an idea. There is no reason for them to produce anything because the cost is so low to take legal action and there's at least 3 other parties involved in the sell."
