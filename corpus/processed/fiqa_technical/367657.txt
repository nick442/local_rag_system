If it became a choice of reading books versus finding internships in the industry I would choose the latter. If it is supplemental material to the internship I think that the ones you have listed are fine. Reading a book about an ever changing industry really isn't going to get you ahead. Experience is. That being said topics related to liquidity, repo transactions, and risk management to be key if you are entering the financial industry. For prop trading there aren't going to be too many people writing about a how to manual on the industry because then they have more competition with their experience. IMO That is why you need to work with these people and acquire the knowledge firsthand. Trading is not something you can read about you need to do it. Especially when you are competing with people who have done it their whole lives.
