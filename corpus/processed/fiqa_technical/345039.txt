What? YOUR reasoning is exactly what you are projecting on me! You want to give the few people with all the money control over anything they can buy! >At the very least, the private sector is policed by the government according to the rule of law. Who polices the government when the people no longer have any authority or power over it? You JUST told me you can’t trust the government to police properly! Now you want to rely on them policing others? Doesn’t that logic sound ridiculous? What I said was: The government’s job is policing. If they are doing their job wrong, you replace them. What you are saying is: I don’t trust the government to police anyone. So let’s give more power to the financial sector which we already know is immoral and greedy, because the government is policing them. WTF?!
