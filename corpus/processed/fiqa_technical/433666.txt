> (1) The value of the MBA is in the network Really? That's the value? No, it's the letters behind your name that people look at when you submit an application / resume. If it's not there they pass you by. Furthermore, an MBA isn't the only way to build a network. Also, congrats on finding some great entry level jobs. When this kid is thinking about his 1st promotion and his peers already have an MBA, he's screwed. Great for the kids at your school.. they're not eligible for anything other than entry level jobs without one. You're behind the trend. Sorry, you're giving the kid bad advice. It will not do him any harm to get it right away.
