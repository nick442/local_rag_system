Because Amazon is not even close to being a monopoly. Look at Wal-Mart revenue to Amazon revenue (even with AWS and everything else). Not even close to being the largest retailer. They are just the largest e commerce retailer. Even there, they still aren't a monopoly. Add in the fact that a lot of amazon sales are marketplace sales (other online vendors selling through amazon), and you see that Amazon isn't even close to being a monopoly. Amazon is just really good at retail. Being so good at something that you gain market share is not covered under anti trust law.
