"Sign up with credit karma. It will give you two scores for free and will show you credit cards you have a good chance in being approved for. Plus it will evaluate your score showing you the 6 items that effect your score and give you steps to improve them or tell you how long you have to wait until they roll off. Plus I would look at a credit union and see if they have any ""fresh start"" programs. You should be well on your way. the thing that is probably hurting your credit is your utilization. If you can just use 10% of your available credit."
