There are things that we can do to make business even better. We could throw out the EPA, we could dissolve OSHA, we can shut down the FTC. Hell, let's get rid of taxes. Let's sell off all federal land, no more low income housing. Why should the government zone land, let's get rid of that. Let's let fracking occur anywhere and any form of power plant built wherever businesses want. No more minimum wage, no more unions, no more child labor laws, no more ACA or medicare or social security. Business is better right? Is any one going to ask at what cost?
