As a European we would wholeheartedly welcome a voluntary reduction in US geopolitical influence. The ability of the United States to dictate terms to Europe on strategic and political matters is an anomaly that has been allowed to persist for far too long. Luckily for the rest of the world the US public are at large grossly uninformed in matters of foreign affairs and don't realise the exceptional strategic positioning they were granted in the wake of the second world war. And they're in the process of ceding that power.
