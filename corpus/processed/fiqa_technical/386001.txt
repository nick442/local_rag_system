Dude honestly your comment is still pissing me off. Your comment history is literally just you going around berating and trying to shit on people with esoteric one or two sentence responses. Literally nothing you write up is ever technical, is focused on modelling, or any pitchdeck/CIM insight that bankers actually do. Like there's no way you're in banking. you're just a sad kid going around on reddit trying to one up people (literally telling some nice dude they sounded deluded and just left it at that)
