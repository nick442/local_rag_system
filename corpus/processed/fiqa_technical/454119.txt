"I'm finishing up a finance & accounting internship at the corporate office of a transportation company (it's a subsidiary of a gigantic UK parent). I've enjoyed it for the most part and my 2 ""bosses"" are extremely nice (corporate accounting manager and her 2nd). I'm going into my junior year at BC Carroll (finance major) and want to end up in corporate finance, IB, or wealth management ideally. What should be my next course of action for the upcoming recruitment season this fall before/after I finish this internship? Thanks for any advice, this sub is very insightful."
