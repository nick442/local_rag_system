"That has not been disproved. What the quote means is ""when [workers as a collective] earn more, [businesses as a collective] get more customers"". It's impossible to disprove this, because it's like a kind of economic tautology. It's like, if I give you five one dollar bills, how many five dollars will you have. What you mean to argue is that that's spacious, because the real world is more complicated."
