> And just out of curiosity what do you do to unwind? Run, go to the gym, come on the computer, go out with friends, watch a movie, etc.. You don't need a drug to unwind, if you need a drug, see a psychologist. > You don't drink or use tobacco or anything of the like? I drink like once a month socially. I have an issue with daily users who complain they can't get a job or don't want to take responsibility for their actions. > But judging other people for wanting a beer or a cigarette or a joint is no way to go through life Why not if they cost me and everyone else money and cause tons of other problems. They cost insurance rates to go higher, they cause accidents, they kill people, the smoke drifts in my face, etc.. If they weren't losers and were actually responsible, it would be a different situation. A big difference I see between alcohol and weed is that there are actually restrictions on when, where, and how you can have alcohol.
