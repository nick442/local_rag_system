I've had Prime for about ten years now and honestly the free shipping component isn't what is keeping me. When I buy things on Amazon I do often click the option to only see prime options, but Prime Video is where I see most of the value. The video service is great and the original programs are pretty good. Not quite Netflix quality or quantity yet. For kids it's great to be able to download videos that are free with prime to watch offline on a plane or in the car. They keep adding more and more prime benefit so I haven't even considered not renewing in several years
