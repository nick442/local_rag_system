A lot wrong with this statement. Services which is 90% of their income is not exclusive to tourism. If you read the entire thing properly you'd know 80% of their income from services is not from the US 80% of its tourism is from the US. You're also changing the argument now you're attacking the economic policies of these countries and claiming it is reflective of their tax policy when in reality that's not true. Do you know what the Bahamian fiscal policies are? EDIT: 50% of Bahamas income is tourism
