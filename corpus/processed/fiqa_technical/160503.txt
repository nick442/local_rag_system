"Who said I'm a workaholic? Since college I've cut down to 40 hours a week, plus another 12 volunteering with rescued dogs and horses, but that's just fun for me. I spend the rest of my time with my family. My entire argument is that *what success I have had* is due primarily to my hard work. I never claimed to be a rich wall street banker or harvard law graduate. Those people I know who are more successful have worked harder than I have, including those who were presented with far less privilege growing up. What's pathetic is that your sense of self worth is so low that you can't take responsibility for your own life and feel more comfortable ascribing the success of others to ""luck"" and random chance. Ask me where I'm at financially in ten years, I'm two years out of college now. I'm willing to bet my ""luck"" just keeps getting better and you're in the same place spinning your wheels. My point in this conversation was perhaps to shock a few of you into seizing the reins of your own destiny. Hopefully my message got through to at least one person."
