If you are a small business, you're likely not doing said business at razor thin margins and making your profits on volume like walmart does. Even minor increases in wages have a sweeping affect on their margins because they are a a huge company. It's the same principle of why McDonalds started limiting and/or charging for ketchup packets. At scale, there are massive costs.
