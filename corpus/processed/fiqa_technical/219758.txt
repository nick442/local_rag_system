I agree. Small investors got screwed worse with manually traded shares. Electronic trading was a big part of why fees for trades have come down so much over the years. HFT acts as a tax on small traders, but it is fairly insignificant. This isn't to say that HFT isn't a problem. Systems that cause flash crashes with no one understanding why, isn't good for the market. A small fee is a small change that could provide a solution to the problem.
