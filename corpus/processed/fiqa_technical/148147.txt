Not everything is about marginal utility and trying to define people by their marginal utility is almost sociopathic. Guess what? Labor isn't that interchangeable and markets are far from perfect. What is the other option other than government help? Let these people starve and live on the street because they can't afford anything else? That is a great way to ruin a society.
