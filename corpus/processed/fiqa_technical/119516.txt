"they make their money by serving weight loss ads and selling virtual coins so people can ""win"" at farmville. their business model is virtually absolutely dependent on the grace and prosperity of Facebook. its a bubble, and it shouldn't surprise anyone. the fact that society considers what zynga does as valuable is almost in and of itself an argument that modern capitalism is rotten. i don't consider them industrialists, this overvalued IPO is a scam based on a fad supporting lowest common denominator advertising."
