Fed Reserve is not responsible for devaluing the dollar, but it is run by secrecy. Should be nationalized and in control of by government. A nation has to have the power over its money printing, it can't let some private large bankers control all its central bank stock shares and the money policies of a nation. the dollar goes down during boom times, but goes up during crisis and recession. the devaluing was more due to too much debt in circulation acting as money supply. when that debt exploded in 2008 US dollar shot to the moon. M2 increased not in relations to M1 before the 2008 crisis. That proves debt/money lent out by commercial private banks was the cause for inflation, not FED base money printing. on youtube you should watch some bill still videos, ellen brown, steve keen, harry s dent, richard wolff. Do not fall for any retarded mises asstrian von hoodwink libertarian gold bug videos telling you how great gold standard or gold exchange program is. That's just plain slavery.
