courthouse news simply summarizes the depositions and complaints issued by plaintiffs. that's all. everything they report can be found in the legal documents that they provide links to at the end of every article. every quote they provide is taken from either plaintiff complaints, police reports, or the depositions of litigants. its audience is not the general public; its audience comprises attorneys and other news media, as the website plainly states on its [about us page](http://www.courthousenews.com/aboutus.html).
