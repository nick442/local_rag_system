For some reason i always thought there were more women then men in this world. Turns out I was wrong so technically they are a minority : The value for the entire world population is 1.01 males/female, with 1.07 at birth, 1.06 for those under 15, 1.02 for those between 15 and 64, and 0.78 for those over 65.
