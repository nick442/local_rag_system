I applied to a travel credit card after my local branch of Bank of America told me I should look into it due to my constant traveling. I've been with them for 3 years and have never had an issue and I was declined on my travel credit card even though I have a decent credit score of 730. I'm also a 22 year old and have my senior year of school to finish but have always been good with Bank of America. Is it because I'm young?
