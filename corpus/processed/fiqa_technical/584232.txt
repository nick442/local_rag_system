"The muni bond business . Are you really too dumb to understand that's how he's referencing it in the article? He's not talking about a specific company or companies numbnuts he's talking about ""The business of muni bonds..i.e the total outstanding municipal bond market."". Try some reading comprehension on for size. To walk you through it there are multiple uses of the word 'business'. Among them are the two you're having a real problem with in your reading comprehension. 1. Business = Company: I run a dry cleaning business. 2. Business = Industry: I am in the dry cleaning business. What he is (clearly) referring to when he says ""a business worth $3.7 trillion"" is ""business = industry"" in the second manner listed above. You're interpreting it as if he's claiming the first manner. That's incorrect. Factually and grammatically incorrect. Yours is the type of ignorance that morons on Reddit rely on to make their arguments work. I'm done here with you since you don't seem to be able to parse out rudimentary information from an article."
