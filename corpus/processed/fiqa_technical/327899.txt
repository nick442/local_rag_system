"I live in Chicago and while I think the city could do a fine job at supporting the vacancies amazon has to offer, it's not on my radar as a place to work if Chicago wins the bid. For every ""my friend didn't hate working at Amazon"", there are a million horror stories. Life's too short to hate your job. Not saying you have to love it, but why spend half of your waking life (oftentimes more at places like this) at a place designed to chew you up and spit you out. I've worked at those places. Never again. It's not worth the money (but will probably be worth the experience for a lot of people, unfortunately)"
