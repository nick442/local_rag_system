The US has been the most trusted since WWII. I'll be happy to take my chances with the US stock market over any other. Yea, there are definitely bubbles in the US economy, where else would you put your money then? Bitcoin, gold, in the euro, Chinese stock market (LOL), land in the US or German bunds? how about oil or Japanese stock market? I'll take US land and US equity any day of the week over any of the other. Maybe some gold sprinkled in. You can invest in the Chinese stock market and the European stock exchanges
