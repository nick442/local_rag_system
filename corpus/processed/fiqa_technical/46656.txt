"So if you know what's inside a DB plan, you'll agree with me that the poor results of DB plans from the likes of Ford, GM, and others like state plans are the result of *poor management*, as opposed to the idea that these plans were a bad idea from the start. I have to disagree a bit with your lottery analogy; winning the lottery is a one-time event that is almost always beneficial - in almost every way - to the winner. It's an additive source of income above and beyond what was anticipated. On the other hand, taking one set of financial outcomes that the recipient had planned on for possibly decades, and replacing it with ""good luck with this"" is *rarely* beneficial to the recipient, regardless of their ""personal discount rate"" (if they even know what such a thing is)."
