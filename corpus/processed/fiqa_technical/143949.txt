This entire situation is extremely far from the revenue generating aspects of the company. If they can contain this issue within a year and a half and within many dozens of millions of dollars, I don't see it affecting them. They've already endured plenty of bad PR seemingly unscathed and have large cash reserves. Everybody still wants their shares too, it's not like they're tanking. Regulations, driver unionization, and slow CEO turnover are much bigger threats.
