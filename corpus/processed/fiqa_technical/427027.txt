I'm not an intolerant person. I'm starting from a position of Lactose Ambivalence. It just doesn't occur to me to buy dairy most of the time. I don't drink milk or eat cereal, I can't have ice cream because of the sugar. But man, I effin' HATE cheese. The smell alone is nauseating! The only exception is cream chesse, which not actually cheese, it's just fat butter.
