"The comment I was originally replying to said successful entrepreneurs are only successful because of luck. My comment said they also put in hard work, but that luck was also a factor. I never said anything about anyone not working hard. If you said ""people from memphis like peanut butter"" and I said ""people from memphis also like jelly"", it would be ridiculous for a third party to jump in and say ""people in nashville also like jelly, and you are a dick for not saying other people like jelly!"". Right now, you are being that third party. You've assumed I was being exclusive, when there is absolutely no mention of exclusivity in my comment. Please interpret this post to say what it says, not what it does not say."
