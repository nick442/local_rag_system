I follow bitcoin more than you think. I suspect I understand it better than you do. So, back to our conversation. Let's stipulate for a moment that you *can* track things in the fashion that you have suggested. That then says to me that it would be relatively easy to ban bitcoin - you can just track down addresses, link them with people, and follow those addresses around. This would stand in stark contrast to the repeated denials by the hodlers that bitcoin can't be regulated - it's too decentralized, anonymous, etc. To many it has been held out as the perfect way to escape the state (i.e. a libertarian's wet dream). What say you to this? It's either very difficult to track and regulate, or it's very easy to track and regulate.
