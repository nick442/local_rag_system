Yes you can. Buy to let mortgages are typically lent on a combination of expected rental income, plus a part of the applicants other income. They also (at the moment) usually require a fairly hefty deposit. The exact requirements are likely to have changed by the time you apply, but in basic, yes. There is another option. You can increase your mortgage on your currently property, and buy the BTL with cash. This gives some more flexibility, as you can move faster, so is great for an auction purchase. It is also often cheaper to mortgage your main property, and you will get a lower rate. Of course, to do this you will need sufficient equity in your main property, and income to cover the mortgage repayments, so the practicality of this depends on your main property value and the amount you need.
