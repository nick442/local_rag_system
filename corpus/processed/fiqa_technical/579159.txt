Russia is ruled by a tyrannical psychopath. Putin, being KGB/FSB just does a good job of hiding the author of his terrorist acts, mostly against other Russians. As well, the government has alliances with organized crime so that *favors* are repaid in less obvious ways, like not arresting someone known guilty or pressuring (on pain of death) journalists not to reveal certain facts and alliances. Putin has allied himself with anyone who will further his agenda. Currently he is allying with US fundamentalist, evangelist Christians and homophobes. He allows police to stand by as gays are terrorized and abducted and tortured through his *patriotic* Putin Youth. These idiots come from the depths of the human soul after everything decent and humane has been sold off for hard cash.
