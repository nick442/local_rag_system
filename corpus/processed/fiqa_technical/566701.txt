>I distinctly remember in dot-com crash it was only Internet stocks that were clearly overvalued. You remember someone had this opinion. Did you ever check the facts? The [S&P 500](http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=%5EGSPC+Basic+Chart&t=my) is the average of the 500 largest corporations of the USA, and it grew steadily through the 1990s, falling after 2000. Now look at [Apple](http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=AAPL+Basic+Chart&t=my) for an example of a tech stock that didn't follow that trend.
