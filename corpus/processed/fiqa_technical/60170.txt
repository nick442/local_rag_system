Foot Locker is getting squeezed in two directions. They're getting pinched on price by online sales while losing the top end of the athletic market to boutique sporting goods stores. Foot Locker let's you try shoes on, that's the only thing their in store experience ads. There are several specialty stores in my area that have a well trained staff that offer good advice and fitting services that I'm more likely to buy athletic shoes from than Foot Locker.
