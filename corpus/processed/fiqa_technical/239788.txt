Dunno. A realist? Unique? :) I think really it depends on whether you consider it worth providing socialist care if the benefit was high for the cost of it. Would be in favour of charging working people an average of around 20% of the wages in order to pay for health care for everyone **assuming** that the maximum benefit could be gained for that money? Libertarians would usually say no. That taxes (aka extracting money under threat of violence) for such a thing are immorral, no matter the benefit. How can you violently force someone to provide care to another person?, they would ask
