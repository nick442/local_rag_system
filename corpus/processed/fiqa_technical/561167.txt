Very difficult situation, I've had similar ones. One option I've resorted to (didn't really work, but may work for you?) was this: say the guy asks for $250, you give him $100 and explain in detail why it's the best you can do at the moment - times are tough, you're saving for XYZ yourself, blah blah blah. Message being sent: Another thing I did once (that worked well) was just drive over, yell at the guy, submit his resume to 20 different places, and watch him get a job within weeks (the guy sat on a couch for months not even looking around). In your case this may translate into taking the friend out to a bar, pouring a couple of beers into him and telling him to grow TF up for baby's sake. Use your judgement re how well that's going to go across :)
