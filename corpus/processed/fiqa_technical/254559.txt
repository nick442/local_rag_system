"Not that they're necessarily lacking, although I wouldn't be surprised if they are relative to the developed world (I'm not going to get into a country by country analysis as there are 40+ in Africa and all with different laws), but more that the governments/institutions (like the courts for example) there are so corrupt and terrible at what they do that nobody respects them and therefore property rights exist in name only. Contrast that with the US (and Canada, Europe, Singapore, Hong Kong, etc.) where property rights have a bastion of strong institutions defending them and there is a large part of the difference. Look at Zimbabwe, where Mugabe literally stole land from the ""white"" farmers and how they're doing versus SA, where the government generally respects/upholds property rights (although the ANC has had some huge issues recently) and how relatively well SA is doing. better yet take it a step further out and look at what happened when Chavez nationalized the oil industry in VZ..it's no surprise that foreign companies don't want to invest there (and investors don't want to buy their debt leading to higher interest premiums) when the government is literally stealing property from ppl/entities via nationalization"
