The problem around here is while the crowd sourced nature of reddit can be great for discussions, when it comes to topics that require specialized analysis or understanding beyond headlines most of the participants are young and have very little direct experience or knowledge on what they're commenting on. So as a business owner with actual experience that you live with and have dealt with for decades you might end up with negative comment votes, while a 15 year old who plays call of duty all day says something popular with the hivemind has hundreds of positive upvotes. At least r/business has more people willing to consider both sides of the argument.. whereas r/politics is pretty much a lost cause. Nevermind I have a top 20 university degree in political science. For even suggesting people consider alternatives or that Obama is anything but a saint I often receive negative comment votes. I don't support Romney OR Obama, but thats as good as evil for most of these people.
