"Even though the article doesn't actually use the word ""discount"", I think the corresponding word you are looking for is ""premium"". The words are used quite frequently even outside of the context of negative rates. In general, bonds are issued with coupons close to the prevailing level of interest rates, i.e. their price is close to par (100 dollar price). Suppose yields go up the next day, then the price moves inversely to yields, and that bond will now trade at a ""discount to par"" (less than 100 dollar price). And vice versa, if yields went down, prices go up, and the bond is now at a ""premium to par"" (greater than 100 dollar price)"
