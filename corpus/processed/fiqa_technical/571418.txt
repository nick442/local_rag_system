"I, too, have worked in both small and large companies; I started with the small ones and am currently at a big one. I agree with all of your points about the upside of working for small companies. Some of the upsides I find at the big company where I work are: - there are people around you that know more than you do. There is a huge opportunity to learn from them, which is a lot harder when you're the lone expert at a 5-person company (you rely on whatever you can scrape up from the internet, etc.). Most people learn faster with good mentoring. - there is money to spend on things that you need. No raised eyebrows from the CEO when you say that you need a $20 lamp for your desk, or even more serious issues like adequate hardware for what you need to do, getting tools you need, etc. (Less of an issue at a VC-funded startup, until the money starts running low.) - there are entire teams that help with things like documentation, customer support, sales, tools, and other things, which frees me up to do what I'm good at, which is making software. I remember reading some advice a while ago that still rings true to me, which is that there isn't a single ""right"" place to work (small/large, etc.); the right thing to do is get experience with a variety of different environments - in the end you'll be stronger for it."
