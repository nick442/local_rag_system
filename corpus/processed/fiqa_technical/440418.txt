Yah, I haven't played in this space very much. My only exposure was visiting a weather insurance company who wanted the fund I was at to take the other side of their bets - paying us a fixed amount and having us cover them whenever their losses were over a certain amount for the month. It looked like a pretty bad deal, but apparently some multi-strat hedge-fund eventually went with it for the uncorrelated beta.
