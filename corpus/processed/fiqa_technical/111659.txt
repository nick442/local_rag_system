"As a BC alum all I can say is..enjoy it! It's an amazing school and the alumni network is incredibly helpful. Make friends, go to Hockey games, have a good time, and take interesting classes outside of CSOM. It's great that you're already so far ahead of the curve in terms of thinking about your future. Just remember: Everyone thinks they will get a 4.0 their first year, but nobody actually does. BC is a semi-target and a lot of my friends got FO summer analyst roles through OCR and were then hired full time. Typically they had 3.6-3.8 GPAs and some extra curriculars. Nobody expects anything freshman year. Even if you ""only"" get a summer internship at some small company helping with the accounting, you will be way ahead. I did a cold calling summer job at a 10 person company and ended up doing Finance anyway. Feel free to PM me if you have any questions about BC or the internship search. Go Eagles!"
