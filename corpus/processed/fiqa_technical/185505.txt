None of the insurance cost increases will change regardless of Obama getting re-elected. They're tied into the ACA, and that won't be repealed, even if Obama loses the election. They're not going to be able to get a repeal through the new senate, regardless of how this election turns out. And most definitely there's zero chance of a new law going through before January 1st regardless of the election.
