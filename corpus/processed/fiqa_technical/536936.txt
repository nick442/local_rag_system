I've found the same thing - Sears tends to be at least 10% more expensive than any other store here in Canada. In a day where you can sit on your sofa and compare prices, Sears just isn't competitive on any level. I've only ever bought one item from Sears in the last three years, and it was because it was a cashmere jacket that was 70% off.
