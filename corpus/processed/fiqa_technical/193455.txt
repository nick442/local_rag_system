> When an EVP comes to your desk and needs something done and you're lower level, that's A Priority, but if you have other priorities that are on deadline from your more immediate boss, then you're scrambling. it gets old. That's your issue, it's not a priority. The thing to remember about this is he's taking about communication, not orders. No one in another division is going to be setting my priorities, I will, or my supervisor will. If you've made a VIP's request a priority, it's your fault. It's maybe different for me coming from an IT background, but I prioritize agnostic of requester. The issue decides the priority, not the user. For the most part, no matter how far up a company you go, explaining to someone that their request is noted, but you have X do get done before you can start is enough. If they insist, let them know they can speak to your supervisor if they feel priorities should be changed. Communication should be open, orders should not.
