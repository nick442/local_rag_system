I was asking myself the exact same thing. And i have come to the conclusion that most of your money should be invested, In index etfs and maybe some bond etfs too. If Inflation is about 2% and the interest you make in a savings account is less than 1%. Your actually loosing money in a savings account. Keep a few thousand bucks in your savings account and the majority invested and working for you.
