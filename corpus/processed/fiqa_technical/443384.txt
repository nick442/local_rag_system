I'm not familiar with it. However you might be interested in [Lords of Finance](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Lords-Finance-Great-Depression-Bankers/dp/009949308X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1323967392&sr=8-1). That's a history book about the economics and the central bankers of the Great Depression. It wasn't written with the current crisis in mind, but it covers what happened last time a similar situation arose, and the consequences of the decisions the central banks made. My guess is that after reading that, you're going to be as well informed as most economists. Also it's a very good read!
