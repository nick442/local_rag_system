"But what's the point of even saying that? You could get killed in a car accident tomorrow. Should I just follow you around and post that any time you have some victory or good news? ""Yeah, you got a promotion, but you could get killed in a car accident tomorrow."" ""Hey, glad she accepted your proposal; but you could get killed in a car accident tomorrow."" I could mix it up - ""You could have a *c. dificile* infection festering in your intestine right now - your days are numbered."" ""Heading to your kid's graduation? Plane could fall out of the sky on the way."" I started all this by saying that the OP was a complete waste of time. It gives no advice, passes on no wisdom. There's nothing about it that anyone could act on to change their life. It offers zero value. Hell - the time I spent reading it (and arguing about it) I could've spent masturbating and been better off. In closing - your success is *affected* by random chance. Also, the sky is often blue and more often than not water is wet at room temperature. Have a nice day."
