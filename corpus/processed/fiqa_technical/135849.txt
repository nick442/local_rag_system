> Cheaper energy is equivalent to a pay raise No it isn't. A pay raise can be distributed as the payee feels fit, cheaper energy only serves one area of expenditure, which as I stated, isn't the major area that somebody who is struggling financially needs help. We don't need more competitive pricing in products, we need business in America to stop focusing on profits for their shareholders over providing decent wages to their employees. America is one of the most (if not the most) competitively priced marketplace in the world. The average person doesn't give a shit that flowerpots cost $3.40 each instead of $3.60, they care that they have shitty healthcare, cannot afford to buy a house, cannot afford rent, cannot afford decent food, have no job security. Corporate profits have skyrocketed, the super-rich keep getting richer, bankers make decisions based on their bonuses rather than the sustainability of their decisions. Cheaper energy isn't going to solve one of those problems. Corp. profits vs wages: http://www.zerohedge.com/news/trade-record-corporate-profits-your-miserable-salary
