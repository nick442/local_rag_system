Have you been involved in any iot or technology company. Even as a customer. Think of how well iot works in fridges and your home (Nest) and then think of having that technology implanted into your body. Think about charging cables on your phone. Is there one kind? No. No one can agree on the standard. If you are ok with 1 chip, why not 3? Why not 5? Do some of them track your location? Maybe?
