"Ultimately, it's a race to the bottom. People don't want to admit this, but the US is on its way out. We had a solid thing going for us but our government went for sale/got bought out by CEOs/lobbyist who had ties to other CEOs who just wanted to maximize profits. This started a trend of always needing to make more money every year. That's unsustainable, and it affects every common person. Anyone from poor to upper middle class. That's a lot of the US's population. This has created a class gap and it's all snowballing. This country runs on a system that exists to only benefit the rich. We need heavier taxes and heavier/extreme fines on the people who manipulate the system and legislate laws that negatively impact the population. I.e: Wall Street executives who caused the 2008 crisis. Heavy penalties like having all their assets forfeited or maybe even taking away their citizenship and banning them from the US. Speaking of the 2008 crisis, people took advantage of that as well. They used that crisis to minimize employees and maximize work at the smallest cost, making the population feel ""lucky to have a job"". We haven't recovered from that, and another more catastrophic recession is on the way. The US is a hollow shell of what it used to be."
