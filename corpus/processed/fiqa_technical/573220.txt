*The Economist* is one of the most virulently Russophobic magazines in the world. Edward Lucas, who heads up their Eastern Europe dept, is pure flake. Schulz spoke at a public conference in Europe. No doubt there is a transcript posted somewhere online. No doubt the Russians published this first because their interests are most directly affected. No doubt more will be written on it but I only saw once that the EU admitted they messed up on the Ukraine Association Agreement by not dealing with Russian business interests in the work. They have since set about remedying that fault with Russia and Ukraine. It is no secret Europe is hurting from the Russia response to western sanctions and it is no secret that Russians are prepared to pay the price because they want it known that just like John J Mearsheimer writes, [**the Ukraine Crisis Is the Westâ€™s Fault.**](http://www.foreignaffairs.com/)
