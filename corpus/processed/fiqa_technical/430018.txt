I don't know about this. Craftsman started selling lots of Chinese made garbage a couple of decades ago if I remember the time frame correctly. Somewhere in that same time frame I recall that their lifetime warranty was only being applied to US made tools and those were getting scarce. I stopped buying Craftsman, so I could be in error here. But I stopped thinking of Craftsman as a top tier non-pro tool maker years ago. Hell, lots of that Mexican Stanley stuff seems better made these days than Craftsman. If Craftsman went out of business and I didn't read it on reddit, I might never know.
