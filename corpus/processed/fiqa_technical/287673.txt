That's not at all what I said. I said regulation is inevitable. The question is, in whose favour we regulate? Employers, owners of capital, or workers. Deregulation usually favours owners of capital and employers, and ends up concentrating wealth in the hands of the few. Because surprise surprise people would rather invest their money in something that just goes up in value rather than put all the effort into creating jobs or paying workers more. Since there are no laws to encourage them to do so.
