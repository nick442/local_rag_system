Because we don't let people with any kind of chronic disorder into the military, especially one that requires constant medication. So no asthma, diabetes, etc. It's an unacceptable risk if that person is cut off from the supply lines or captured and unable to get medication. In the army you might be expected to survive in the field for extended durations. It's a good idea to exclude people for the sake of combat readiness. That's why we have an army in the first place. To be combat ready. But again, I'm sure you would circlejerk about how evil a decision it is, because you no longer think critically about things and you have fully internalized the propaganda. To the point where you don't even think it's necessary to justify or explain it, you seem to think that it speaks for itself.
