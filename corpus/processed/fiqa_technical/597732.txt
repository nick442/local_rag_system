sure sounded like it. I'm going to guess Hillary is tight with Janet and October's debt ceiling juncture is going herald the start ball buster season (I'm thinking the repubs rubber stamp an increase while the Fed puts all 2+ trillion of roll overs on hold until midterms). The resulting bond auction failures should be fun to watch. Remind me how much of the treasury's debt auctions are dedicated to paying just the interest? First the interest payments stop (technical default), then the principal disappears (actual default). Could be a bad time to be in bonds, period.
