"> why else move there? I understand your point, and not arguing buut.imo NW AR seems near close to perfect. Depending on your lifestyle, wants, needs etc personally it would be top 5 places I'd move if I had a well paying job lined up. Unlimited hiking, hunting, boating, mild winters, lush green, laid back, out of the packed crowds of other cities, clean, natural, very affordable property and good soil for a garden, chickens, few heads of cattle etc etc. the Ozarks are magical. I know a lot of people that haven't been to that part of the country who would absolutely love it. It's just sort of unknown/off the beaten path and lumped in with ""the south"".plus it's close the lovely Branson! ;)"
