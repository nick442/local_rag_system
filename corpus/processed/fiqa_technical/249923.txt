>I know very well how my local government works >Presidential and statewide elections have no bearing on employment contracts for city workers. You seem to think Port Authority employees work for the city. This is obviously untrue. If you are unable to understand this simple fact, you clearly overestimate your understanding of the local government. The governor for the last 5 years has been a democrat. David Paterson appointed the current executive director of the Port Authority. How can you possibly agree with OP blaming this on republicans? How am I being disingenuous? I have simply stated hard facts while you have misled with your insinuation that this was a republican's fault, which it is not.
