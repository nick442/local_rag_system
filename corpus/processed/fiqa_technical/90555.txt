"If you're a good candidate in terms of all the usual metrics then it will really come down to selling yourself to any potential advisers. Remember that in PhD admissions individual professors are really making the admissions decisions. Also, as you said you're from an econ background.. Unsurprisingly, mathematical finance is going to be pretty ""mathy."" If you haven't had courses in real analysis, differential equations, Fourier analysis, and statistics you may want to brush up on those subjects. I say this because I am doing a PhD minor operations research (coming from a mechanical engineering background) and I have been overwhelmed at times by the level of technical rigor that they take in these courses relative to my ""normal"" engineering math courses. I would have been well served studying some real analysis before taking stochastic calculus, for instance."
