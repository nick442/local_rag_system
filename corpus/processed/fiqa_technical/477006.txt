Ok Quick reply then im off this topic. same rights for everyone not for a specific groups. She said Muslims ( which implies ALL of them). You didn't get my example at all so please read again. I compared a personal attack to an attack of a whole group which is more damaging but most people are strangely ok with that. I was in Sweden recently.. turns out no one is shitting in the streets or burning cars its actually very clean with extremly low crime rates ðŸ¤”.. very strange maybe this is a stereotype? Sweden is often under attack from dubious sources although they are a pretty good country which in many ways is even superior to Germany. Oh and hate helps no one! You missed the point here again ! Hate is never productive. criticism is a civil form of communication and the germans do it very often, believe me. Why are you hating so much groups? Even if you disagree and argue with someone there is still a long way to go to say you hate someone. Also hating groups is generally problematic. I know people you can only describe as Nazis, but i don't hate them. I think they are idiots and i want nothing to do with them... but thats it. And so my final words on this topic: I don't think everybody hates. I can't think of one i hate. A lot of my friends hate nobody i'm pretty sure about that. In love not hate the German guy ( wow we went way off topic or is anyone still thinking about Facebook.
