I had an interview with blockbuster head office, United Kingdom in 2011. It was for a senior management type role. In the interview I asked one of the managers who was on the Board what the company was doing about the like of Netflix and LoveFilm. His answer stunned me. He said nothing really. The industry will always need us to distribute films by DVD rental. They need DVD sales. Etc. The model works. I was absolutely stunned by the whole firms naivety. Declined the job. Not surprised to see the company fold. Edit: got date wrong - was sometime around March 2011.
