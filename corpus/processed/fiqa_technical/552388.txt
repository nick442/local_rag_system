>So now you have to go hunting for things to be offended by? New level of desperation there. Lolwut? You make a smug comment and someone wants to prove you wrong -- on reddit?! How dare they! How desperate to hold someone to their words! Libcucks just don't get it do they? >Let's discuss a timely topic, which I'm sure you have an opinion on: >Do you feel transgender people, with over 40% suicide rate, should be allowed in the military? Well, considering that anyone with diagnosed depression or history of suicidal behaviors is already barred from joining the US military whether or not theyre transgender is irrelevant to the topic. Yes, they ahould be allowed in assuming they meet the criteria already set in place for physical and psychological tests. Additionally, we know that discriminating against transgender people at work is correlated with a significantly higher rate of suicide (Haas, Rodgers, Herman, 2014) so actively doing so is not only ineffective, but counterproductive. There is no reason transgender people who meet all physical and psychological tests should not be allowed in the military. I look forward to your intelligent discourse.
