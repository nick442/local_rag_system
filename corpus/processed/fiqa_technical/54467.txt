I definitely see the advantages of globalism. And from an economical point of view the takeovers make sense. But from a political strategic point of view, I think we Europeans should be careful. They are state-owned, we'd literally be selling to the Chinese government. I'm Belgian, and one of our distribution system operators almost got taken over by a Chinese state owned company. That's a bit too strategic to my liking.
