To take a higher level view of this, consider the warranty as buying insurance. They want to sell you the warranty because there's profit in it for them over the aggregate of all the warranties they sell. So ask yourself, would having to replace this item out of your own pocket cause you a significant financial burden? Items like houses we insure because we can't afford to lose the investment. Items like cars we get liability insurance because we can't afford to pay for another person's medical costs if we're liable for their injury. On the other hand, if you're talking about a $1000 piece of equipment in your house, this won't break you. That means you can self-insure, and if you do that for all the items you purchase, over the long haul, then you will save money (equal to the profit that the company expects on the warranties). So I say, no, don't buy extended warranties. The more they're trying to sell it to you, the less you should be willing to buy it (because the higher their profit margin is if they can convince you to buy it).
