I think his conclusions apply only to sole proprietorships that provide cheap, commoditized services. My story is a little different. I've been a sole proprietor, writing software and providing services related to that software, for 15 years. Over that time, I closed two IP sales to large competitors. One of those was an 8-figure deal. I never provided commodity services, saved as much of my consulting income as possible, toughed out the fallow periods, invested years of unpaid time inventing new ideas and writing new software, treated my customers very well, and always negotiated hard for value.
