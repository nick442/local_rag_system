From what you have typed Up, this is very impressive I would not be surprised if you could squeeze another 50,000-100,000 out of this car. Honda has a good reputation for making reliable cars. Also from your post you mentioned that your are not too car savvy. Dealership repair are usually unnecessary after the car is off warranty reason being that most if not all repairs will be 2-3x more than a good reputable local shop. Also many aftermarket parts are just As good if not better than dealership car parts and not to mention that with Hondas the options are Endless..parts are easy to come by. Buying a new car has some benefits but usually it ends up being more expensive to go new vs maintaining an older car. At this point in time, you can save the most money by finding a local reputable shop to do your repairs, there is no point in going with the dealer, also if you are using regular motor oil ( not synthetic) you don't need to change it every 3,000 miles like the dealer says, oil technology has improved so much that you can go 5,000 miles with no problem, just make sure your oil level it topped off. I will say this though anything electrical that is an issue is a good reason to get rid of the car.
