The problem with this is that the guys that actually use this shit for work (djs that actually still make music) can't get their shit pressed anymore because big guys (Sony etc) are completely maxing out the presses and there is simply not enough capacity anymore.

At the same time it will kill why it became hip in the first place .. same old
