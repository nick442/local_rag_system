Except the survey didn't have that result and your new title is just as incorrect. Not everyone got a pay raise. That doesn't even begin to pass the smell test. http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2011/dec/14/executive-pay-increase-america-ceos > The Russell 3000 measure of US stock prices was up by 16.93% in 2010, but CEO pay went up by 27.19% overall. For S&P 500 CEOs, the largest companies in the sample, total realised compensation – including perks and pensions and stock awards – increased by a median of 36.47%. Total pay at midcap companies, which are slightly smaller than the top firms, rose 40.2%. The average increase was between 27-40% depending on who you count, but that doesn't mean there were across the board increases.
