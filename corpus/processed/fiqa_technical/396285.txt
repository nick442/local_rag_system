The most relevant aspect of Islamic banking that distinguishes it from non-Islamic banking is the prohibition of charging interest. There is no prohibition on the utilization of technology. Since banks that comply with Sharia make direct investments (sharing of profit/loss), and leasing, many banks that are sharia-compliant are very modern, sophisticated, and behave very much like private equity or even in some cases hedge funds. There is a prohibition in Sharia to avoid excessive risk, so many modern Islamic financial institutions deploy and trade financial derivatives to provide the means to risk management. This is done on a very technological level with expertise. London has become a hub of Islamic banking and there have been efforts by the financial sector to push to make London the center of Islamic banking. These institutions are as advanced as any non-Islamic banks.
