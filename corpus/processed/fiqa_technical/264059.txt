Yes, that is a problem. When you have ex-Goldman Sach's CEO's become Treasury Secretaries or Governors of NJ, they are bound to have influence that favors their older company. Hence we need agencies like Elizabeth Warren's CPFB that audits and checks the govt. However, my main point is that you cannot expect exchanges to self regulate so the min. HFT hold time of 5 secs imposed by exchange will likely not happen by the exchange on its own volition. You will need govt. law to impose it.
