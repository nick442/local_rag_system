"I remember I saw a study that said minimum wage increases have minimum affects on how ""expensive"" everything gets. It has an affect on inflation in that sense but not to the dramatic levels conservatives put it at. Ontario will be putting it's min wage to $15 in two years, $14 in the coming January. It's almost $13 now. It's chugging a long nicely and inflation has been lower than it should be."
