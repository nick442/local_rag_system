People will never stop being items they need. Clothes,Computers, Phones, Cars, Furniture etc. The problem the way I see it is that we lost mainstream culture. In general, we define our identify via the goods we purchase. Are we iOS or Android, Bike or Car, Vegetarian or Meat, Democrat or Rebublican. Nothing matters anymore. Today you can be anything you want and you will find a community that supports your worldviews. Grunge is not dead, as Punk or Goth is not dead, even Juggalos or fist pumping guido's have their space. Retail is fragmented obliterating the need for large Department stores.
