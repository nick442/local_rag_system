It's not projection. I was born less than a serf. I grew up between trailer parks and sleeping in cars. The manner by which I climbed out provided me the skills that make me qualified for the situation described above. The military and a decade of conflict does wonders. Status quo remains? I prosper. Technology makes jobs obsolete? I prosper even more. Society collapses? I'm nobility.
