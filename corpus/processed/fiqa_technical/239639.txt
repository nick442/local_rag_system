I'm not saying it means it will keep going up. But I think we can say that every person so far that has said bitcoin is done/over/dead whatever. Has been wrong. Eventually they might be right. Probably even. But the people saying when it's going to crash for the last time know as much as the people saying it's going to climb forever.
