The reason your scheme fails is because you're attempting to make all bonds trade at their face value plus interest, regardless of the credit of the issuer. In all of your examples, you're suggesting I can pay my bill to the electric company using bonds from XYZ corp. Does my electric company have a right to refuse XYZ Corp bonds as payment and demand other payment? If they do have a right to refuse payment, it is almost a certainty my electric company will have no interest in poring over the books of XYZ Corp or MomAndPop's Country Diner in order to decide whether they accept or reject the payment. They will simply reject it and demand cash. If they can NOT refuse to accept the payment, then you will immediately have all sorts of shell corps who's only purpose is to accumulate debt and act as a free money printing press for some other shadowy entity. In both cases, your plan fails.
