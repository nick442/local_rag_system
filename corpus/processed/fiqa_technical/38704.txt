How is adding loss leaders going to crush wall mart or Kroger? Okay people come in and buy the new marked down items. Then what? They are going to quickly realize how expensive everything else is and never shop there or just shop there for the loss leaders. To me this hardly seems like a plan that will crush other grocery stores.
