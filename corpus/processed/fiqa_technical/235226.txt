I think India and Africa are going to center of the economic growth market in the next two decades. Probably more India, since they have the means to develop and a culture that wants it. I think the growth rates are all relative, but you obviously know the standard growth rate of the Sp500. I just can't see it falling because we are still in the middle of a complete globalization and I really think it won't be over before I retire. It will probably yake Africa 50 years before they reach a first world living standards we enjoy now. God only knows what we will have as the definition of first world by then. The medical industry alone will drive a large portion of growth. Cyber security is going to be the next frontier in tech as the internet of things explode into our daily life. I am not as weary about long term growth. We are always innovating and creating new markets. The beauty of the Sp500 is that it doesn't even have to be in the US to make money off it.
