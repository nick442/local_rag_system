"lol he's been called out on /r/borrow by /u/FoxK56 plenty of times yet still keeps on going. Goddamn energizer bunny with wasted energy. /u/iceman1800 - go become a gigolo with your ""supremely good looks"" so that you can stop asking/scamming for money and stop thinking about idiotic business ideas.
