Seems pretty nice. My only real complaint with my current MacBook Pro is its heft. I opted for the solid state drive, and it has a thing or two that i'll never need (the CD drive) but, unfortunately, I've got to get my money's worth out of this one before I even consider an upgrade. I've also already got the developer preview of Yosemite and while I genuinely dislike the new iOS 7 look that they're trying to push on to all of their devices, the hardware itself is still top notch. With just a handful of tweaks (like restoring the icons from OS X 10.9) its regained a portion of the professionalism that I've come to expect. OS X is still an incredible OS; I just hope they keep it that way.
