US centric view here, and keeping in mind that we're talking about the Federal budget: I'd start off by cutting the military budget to equal what the next three biggest spenders (China, Russia, UK) devote to their military. This would be more than enough for actual defensive needs vs. being the world's policeman. Close up foreign military bases and come home. Then cut all other discretionary spending so that it's dwarfed by defense. Adjust Social Security, government pensions, and military benefits down to a sustainable level. Why? Because we're going broke and can't keep the promises we've already made. Moving forward, let the states handle social programs. That way we can try 50 different things to see what works instead of waging a winner-take-all battle at the Federal level.
