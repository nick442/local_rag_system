"The question for each business will have to be ""does automation make sense""? There is a cost associated with switching, but is that greater for the business than keeping employees at a higher wage? Also, we've seen little enough of automation at the customer service level, that we don't know if the customer base will respond well to it.. Is this going to be another lesson learned like offshoring? This is still just a shock. I have a gut feeling that outside of limited applications in the fast food industry, automation of service jobs will be more similar to grocery store implementations of self service registers than anything else."
