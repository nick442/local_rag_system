Hey, to be a bit more personal, I'm in a similar situation (albeit houses near me are all like $300k for a shack). Don't rush into a house that will make you miserable, either because it's crap, or because it'll cost you an arm and a leg and your firstborn. It's perfectly fine to rent another year or two and build up your downpayment, credit history, and credit score.
