Well..yea. We knew that from the beginning. No one is questioning the ability of a top tier school to get OCR. The point I am trying to make is that a fundamental tenacity will see you through with all else acting as support. So if you have OCR, that's great! You just took a huge leap forward. If you don't, well its just another tough challenge to tackle.
