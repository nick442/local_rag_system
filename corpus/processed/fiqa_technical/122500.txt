Ah, my bad! You are refering to the study's methodology, right? In the introduction of the study, they mentioned that several countries have repealed their wealth tax, so I got the understanding that they used those instances as exogenous events from which they could draw conclusion. Upon reading more carefully, it does indeed seem like this study did a cross sectional study over time instead.
