"You're a libertarian, aren't you. But I keep hearing this ""get out the way"" govt. a lot from Libertarians without really qualifying what it means. Govt. already is quite out of the way. All it is doing is setting new rules when needed. Like in this case, HFT's are operating willy nilly and the govt. is now trying to say - Hang on a min, we need to ensure fairness. And reviewing HFT's. It never prevented HFT's from starting up and operating. Only if it is a problem it is stepping in. Govt. supports free market but diff is it wants a refereed and regulated free market. Not unregulated or self-regulated. Re. the consumer electronics, last I checked FCC stickers are on most of them. Govt is sanctioning the devices so it doesn't contain radiation that'll kill us etc. (just kidding but you get the idea). Not sure who/what the u/w labs does."
