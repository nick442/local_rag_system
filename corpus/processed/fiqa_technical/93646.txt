Spectrum-wise, Sprint is actually in the best position of all four major carriers. They have enough nationwide 800 MHz spectrum for good voice and LTE coverage and penetration, and they have enough 2.5 GHz spectrum to outdo every other carrier in capacity. They are the one carrier that really doesn't need any more spectrum right now. The argument about tower count is largely irrelevant with today's mobile data demand. You will find that Verizon and AT&T have built out at least as densely (and usually much moreso) as Sprint and T-Mobile, even with having 10-20 MHz of 700 MHz spectrum each, precisely because of capacity demands. All four major carriers are rolling out microwave spectrum for capacity (AWS and PCS for Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile, and BRS/EBS for Sprint), and dense site placement is going to be a necessity. The argument about accuracy is also ridiculous considering the performance at the edge-of-cell and in the sector nulls; you're going to need multiple sites regardless if you want acceptable coverage for everyone. The company hurting the most spectrum-wise is T-Mobile since they only own a few 700 MHz licenses and can't even use them in most places until after the FCC incentive auction next year. AT&T could use a little more microwave, but they do have 20 MHz of WCS nationwide that they're about to start deploying.
