Can't both things be right.? They're still losing a **SUBSTANTIAL** amount by offering tickets at $99, yet saving a **LOT** by not losing planes.. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Oe8T3AvydU So. again. I reiterate, can't both things be right..? Edit: I'll summarize the math shown in the video: Assumes using an A380 with 154 seats, flying from NY to Washington DC *All dollar amounts assume PER PERSON* $2.50 - in fuel costs. $1.50 - in crew costs. $13.50 - in takeoff/landing fees in JKF and Dulles. $6.00 - Domestic passenger tax. $4.00 - Domestic Flight Segment Tax. $5.50 - 9/11 Security Fee. $11.50 - in Flight Cycle payment. $14.00 - Airplane maintenance. $10.00 - Overall operations overhead (conservative estimate) $0.25 - Insurance. **Our very rough grand total is!!**.. $68.75 Lets just round up to $70. for other small things not covered. And again, this is assuming we fly a very short distance, using very conservative estimates..
