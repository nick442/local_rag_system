Funny how stealing becomes OK after you hit a certain limit of how much you steal and who you steal it from, isn't it? People seem more and more to have some sense of entitlement and selfishness. I read the article and got the sense that it said the corporations should not be allowed to go bankrupt so easily, where a lot of people here read it that common people should be allowed to be as dishonest as the corporations. Hopefully, there are more people like you and me in the world, and less like the greedy ones.
