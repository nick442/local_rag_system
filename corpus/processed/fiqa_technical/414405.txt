"Most people are aware of the existence of merchant processing fees. If this really bothers anyone: * Get a rewards credit card * Pay the bill off in full every month * Redeem your points for cash back You've now recovered a good portion of the fees back and have still had the convenience of not carrying cash and all of the other random ""benefits"" (extended warranty, travel protection, etc) cards carry these days. Some of the programs with 5% cash back will put more back in your pocket than what the fees are since they generally run around 2-4%."
