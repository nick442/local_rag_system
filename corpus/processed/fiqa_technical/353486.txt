To be fair, I am sure the label will be the one paying for it. If any of these artists have a new album (or whatever we call them now) it will be worth the dollars. How much did U2 pay for their commercial and free download on iTunes last year? The NFL is a business and should be driving as much revenue from as many sources as possible, just like any other business.
