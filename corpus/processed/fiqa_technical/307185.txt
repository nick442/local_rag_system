Canada is like that guy who is legally an adult, but hasn't ever really had to fend for themselves. When the fridge is constantly stocked and the lights and heat are always on, it's easy to point out other people's problems. But they never stopped to think about what mom and dad had to do to make everything work like a well oiled machine. And now that mom and dad are starting to tighten the purse strings and jr has to go out in the world by themselves, they start to see that they share a lot of the same problems as all the people they've been pointing fingers at.
