Our Website http://www.ohiotheatre.net/ The Ohio Theatre lobby typically opens 1 hour prior to curtain, but, presenters may open the auditorium doors at their discretion. However, all guests must have a ticket regardless of age, and all children must be seated with an adult. The theater reserves the right to remove any person disrupting a performance or inhibiting the enjoyment of an event for guests without refund.
