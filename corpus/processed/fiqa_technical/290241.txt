"Individual liberty and freedom are inalienable rights and that is what conservatism was built on. Conservative principles will always stand true. My time and how I choose to spend it is my natural born right. Using my time the way I want is my liberty so long as I am not obstructing another person's same natural born rights. This is not an opinion. Again, these are what conservatives - not the Mitch McConnell, or Paul Ryan, or other slimy GOP party member types in Congress - believe in. Those crumbs want big government, too. You don't get the hypocrisy with conservative thinking that you get with the progressive (and current day democrat) thinking. Progressives and democrats believe in something called pro-choice. You probably already knew that. You know the ""my body, my choice"" slogan that baby terminators believe in? Well, tell me why that same slogan doesn't hold true when it comes to health care? ""My body, my choice"", am i right? I think I am done here."
