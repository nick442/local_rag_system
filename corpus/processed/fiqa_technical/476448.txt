I would look at it as more of a balance in general assuming you have the ability to contribute pre or post tax money and you expect your retirement tax rate to be about the same. Pre-tax money gives you flexibility of withdrawal during retirement. Say one year you have unusually high expenses you can pull money from your taxed accounts until you hit the top of your target tax bracket and then pull the rest out of already taxed accounts. Note that if you have the same tax rate today as when you retire. The traditional account will net you slightly more money, but not a huge amount.
