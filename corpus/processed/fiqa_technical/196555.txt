I ignored nothing. Click the Wikipedia link I provided, sort by UN R/P 10%, in descending order. Now look at the top 30. Overlap with the top 30 on the [HDI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_Human_Development_Index)? Zero. As for your anecdote.. the fact that you try to justify a sweeping statement about *international economics throughout history* - and one that happens to contradict just about every piece of data in existence - by talking about your own, personal experiences gives me the distinct impression that talking economics with you might just be a waste of time.
