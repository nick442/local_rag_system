"It is called context. You want to drop context to make your comment seem less silly. You could just say ""oh hey man, thats not what I meant"" but instead you want to play semantics and try your best to be technically correct in your head. Ok so you win, if we drop the context of this discussion and leave your comment in a void it says one thing. In the context of this discussion it says another. To some readers in this context some will see you as correct contextually because they agree with you, some will see you as correct technically because this is reddit and we have a hard-on for technicalities and then others like myself will look at the context and expect some sort of continuity with the context here. You could try to clarify your comments understanding that we perhaps are not all best selling writers or you could get your parts in a knot and start an argument on the internet. what you do from here is up to you. EDIT: Also you never did answer my question about high school/GEDs being good enough in your world are we dodging or are you just that fired up that I want to apply context to your statements?"
