You won't get taxed twice because it's different money going into each account type. In the Roth you've put after tax earnings and those will continue to grow tax free (assuming you wait til 59.5 to start your withdraws). The traditional IRA is going to be funded with your old 401k, which was funded with pre-tax dollars they took from your paycheck. So you'll still pay taxes on the back end for the traditional IRA (money you've never been taxed on) but your Roth has money where tax has already been taken out so no extra tax there. You can have both types of accounts, it's pretty common considering most 401k plans are pre tax but many people see the benefit of a Roth as greater than the tax write off you get from the 401k, but if your company matches you're not gonna leave free money on the table. Hope that helps.
