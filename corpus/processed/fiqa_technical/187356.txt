> To get a well paying job requires a degree these days. Not if you're willing to do some manual labor. The skilled trades are experiencing a shortage of young workers. They pay pretty well. Well enough to save for college. > Not everyone has the money to pay for college without a loan. Does that mean they shouldn't be able to get a well paying job? The unfortunate reality of the world is that life, sometimes, isn't fair. To be fair, I needed student loans to get through school. I didn't choose to major in art history or underwater basket weaving though. After a year of majoring in mathematics, I realized the dire economic decision I was making and chose to pursue engineering instead.
