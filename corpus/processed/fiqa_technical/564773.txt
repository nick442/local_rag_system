Yeah, I mean the real issue is that for probably 30% of users (conservatively) it's and IM system and how they get market data. Anyone that uses BDHs or backtesting does not have a reliable alternative. The analytical tools FS offers for those functions cost almost as much. Also, index level data is very expensive, separated and priced by the index managers themselves. The degree to which this 'debate' has been dumbed down is remarkable.
