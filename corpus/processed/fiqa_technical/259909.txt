Up until the last couple of years, working at Sears was a fairly decent job - nothing to write home about but had benefits and would put food on the table. What do you think is going to happen to the people who are laid off? Do you think they're going to get a better job? I believe it's unlikely - I think the people who lose their jobs are going to suffer, and badly. I suppose a collapse is coming and I should be hoping it happens as soon as possible. But it's hard for me not to think about all these people suffering in the meantime.
