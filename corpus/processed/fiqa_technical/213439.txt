It isn't a false prediction. It is just totally meaningless. Economies move in cycles so of course we are going to have another recession. This guy gets the benefit of the doubt by not having a specific date while also getting to boast that he is right when an inevitable recession finally strikes. He can't possibly be wrong, which makes his insights worthless.
