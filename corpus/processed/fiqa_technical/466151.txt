"My ass. Government regulations are VERY necessary to ensure health and safety. The free market can't decide everything. What you are failing to realize is that sure, it's bad for business for a company to fuck over their customers, however that doesn't mean that people should have to get hurt, poisoned, or killed by ""bad"" businesses that haven't went under yet. You sound like one of those ridiculously paranoid conservatives who think that Obama is an evil socialist."
