"Well you're clearly misinformed. Read ""When the music stopped"" - so many factors went into the crisis. JPM did NOT need the bailout money. Regarding all banks failing, I think the financial system as a whole would've taken a massive hit with letting Lehman fail and not stepping in but to say that ""all banks"" would've failed is inaccurate. No one really knows how extreme the fallout would've been without the cash surge."
