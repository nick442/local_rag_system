Sure. So how do domestic interests get protected if the US pulls the nuclear option, aka trade war? These things do tend towards MAD if escalated, hence lose/lose. The only winning move is not to play. In that respect, this is not only a dick move (US has at least as much to lose from global climate change as EU) it is a *stupid* dick move. Because it backfires, and ruins things for everybody. Including the US.
