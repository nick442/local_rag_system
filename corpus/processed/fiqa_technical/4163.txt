"As long as it's optional and the drivers are paid as part of the fair I don't think a tip option is a big deal. Again, it has to be optional as a reward for extraordinary service not the ""tip"" in a restaurant which is actually payment for services rendered because the cost of food doesn't cover labor for waitstaff. Any service oriented job should have the ability to accept a tip for exceptional service in the same form of currency as the primary form of payment. Ideally, no one would need to live off of tips."
