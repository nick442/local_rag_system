I am not sure how they do it in the Nordic countries, but here in the US a lot of company owners like myself are taxed through the corporation. So in effect, raising taxes on corporations is the same as raising taxes on the business owner. That being said, I kind of agree with the sentiment of the article. If you lower taxes on me and my company, that money is going into savings. That money isn't going to be reinvested. Our budget is where our reinvestment comes from, not extra cash at the end of the year.
