I would like to open an art studio. Not necessarily a gallery, but a place where I can do animation, digital art, branding/logos, and freelance stuff. Also, do some filming there. So an art-production studio. It's what I enjoy but I live in an area that is too rural for that kijnd of thing. But idk, it might work.
