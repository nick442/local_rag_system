Computers and digital cameras are great candidates for handing down because they can still be useful long after they have started looking dated to the initial buyer. Buying DVDs is unfortunately more convenient than renting in my hometown, but we make up for this by a liberal borrowing policy. And, perhaps most unusually, coupons -- the special discounts that mail-order retailers like to send when it's convenient for them to make a sale (or just arbitrarily, really). Those often have complicated terms so that they are only really interesting if exactly two articles are ordered, or the amount of the order exactly 80 EUR. A couple of persons in the family are the specialists of these discounts, and others can just tell them to watch for an interesting item. They'll place the order at the best time.
