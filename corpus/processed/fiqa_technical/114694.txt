What if patents were kept a secret for, say, the first year or more? Then, if anyone was able to duplicate the patent once seen in the wild without the recipe within that timeframe the patent becomes void. The whole purpose of the patent system was to bring difficult ideas out of being trade secrets and into the public's hands for their benefit with the offer of exclusivity for some time to keep the exchange fair. If anyone can duplicate one-click without any hand-holding just by using Amazon.com once or twice, there was nothing to be gained from the patent in the first place. It should have remained a trade secret.
