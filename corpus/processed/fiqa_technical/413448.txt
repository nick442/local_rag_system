We do need to reduce the influence of private money in politics, but we do not need the government to get involved in income redistribution. This is not just. A just society embraces proportionality. It is, in other words, a meritocracy. Not only, is it morally right, it's also sensible. If everyone receives the same regardless of effort and contribution, that creates an incentive to work as little as possible. If you punish legitimate success, you harm everyone and perpetuate poverty. Inequality doesn't matter; poverty matters, and these are not interchangeable issues.
