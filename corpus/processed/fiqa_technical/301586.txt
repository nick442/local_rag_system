To put it another way: If we overturn elections to go to whoever didn't get helped by a foreign powers, then all foreign powers have to do is help the candidate they want to lose. Also, while there seems to be evidence that Russia did stuff, when you look at the numbers and demographics, it looks like a very ordinary election. Republicans and Democrats got similar amounts and kinds of voters. So, it's hard to quantify how much of an impact it actually had if any. A lot of the people who bought into the Clinton scandals and fake news that are claimed to have swayed this election are people who had already decided they weren't voting for Clinton before the scandals came out.
