Truthfully, I don't know, but in actuality, a 4-5 billion dollar loss even isn't the big deal, it's more important that they lost almost 40B of market cap. Now realistically it's relatively oversold in my opinion and they will make it back eventually, but that has more of an impact on them in the here and now. As far as the offset you are asking about, I'm not sure, personally I don't trust any accounting practices of banks, in reality, it's entirely possible that not even the c-suite understands their exact financial position at any given time. The reports of this loss actually came out about a month before they were even able to make an educated guess as to how much their losses would be. In any case, there are much more qualified/knowledgeable people on here that could likely answer your question a bit better.
