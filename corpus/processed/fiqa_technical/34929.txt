Child care - will a parent stay home? Bring Child to daycare? Nanny? This can range from $4k+ to nearly $15K for daycare outside the house. For a nanny (of course, we found a gal with a masters degree in early childhood development) it can run to a full salary, $30K in her case. The extra mouth to feed, the diapers, clothes, etc. Education - Will you plan to pay for the child's college? Some people can't or feel they shouldn't. If you will, it can run about $180K in today's dollars for a private 4 year college. Ours is now 12, so I'm sure my aging brain has forgotten some of the obvious expenses.
