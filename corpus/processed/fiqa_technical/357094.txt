"It will count as income, and you can deduct as much of your moving expenses as allowed by tax laws. If you also count it as a reimbursement, then you're double-taxed - once for the income and again by reducing your moving deduction. The ""reimbursement"" amount is designed for when you get literally reimbursed for exact expenses directly, bypassing the tax on that compensation. The only difference will be that you (and your employer) pay FICA and medicare on the ""relocation bonus"" that you wouldn't if you were reimbursed. Also, with a reimbursement you are not incentivized to minimize the cost of your relocation (since it's not your money you're spending). With a bonus, since you get to keep whatever is left over, you have a vested interest in keeping your expenses down."
