"Good plan. I would vote for someone that ran on this platform. There is simply no rational political party in the US. I honestly believe that most ""undecideds"" or "" independents"" would support something like this but there is simply no large consensus of people throwing ideas out like this. Its either Tea Party economics or Liberal entitlements. Also, who the hell is Phillip Greenspun? Thanks for the link, good stuff."
