"We need to fix this sub. Bots and spam are ruining it. Why are there no mods doing anything? Between /u/PostNationalism and /u/PhocionPubliusHam they have over half of all of the posts on the front page of this sub. This is straight propaganda. /u/PhocionPubliusHam is a freaking bot that keeps posting anti-trump threads. Regardless of what you think about the president, this isn't what this sub is about. Take a look, the ""user"" /u/PhocionPubliusHam (It) has over 7,000 karma and 0 comment karma. They don't even try to hide that is a bot just spamming! It has posted over 500 different threads in the 2 months it has been active, without making a single comment. Take a look at what all the threads are about, I'm sure you will be shocked. its probably a bot for /u/postnationalism as he is another anti-trump spammer. What are the other moderators going to do about this? I'm getting really sick and tired of this and it is becoming more and more blatant every day by MANY USERS."
