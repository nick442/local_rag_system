"Generally speaking, most banks do like having you as a customer, and will refund ""provably"" fraudulent charges without regard as to the actual how it happened. The problem with ATM skimming is that while they are investigating, you don't have the money, vs credit card numbers being stolen, you don't have to pay that charge. So, even if it is actually fraudulent, you're still out the money until the investigation completes."
