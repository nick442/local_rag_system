"As far as I know, it's not barred by the primary anti-discrimination statute, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. There are some state and local protections against being fired or discriminated against based on this, but the long and short of it is that it's pretty few and far between. If the CEO in question fired people who were all affiliated with the Democratic Party, and didn't fire people who weren't affiliated with said party, those who were terminated may have a case at that point. This is from a [linkedin discussion](http://www.linkedin.com/answers/law-legal/employment-labor-law/LAW_ELW/449714-9356514): > For private situations, there is also a Federal statute, 42 USC 1985(3), that prohibits conspiracies to deprive persons of equal rights and privileges that has been raised in various contexts. The statute, which is a Reconstruction era law, is broadly drafted to correct some of the abuses that arose after the Civil War for blacks trying to exercise their rights. However, it addresses ""any person or class of persons of the equal protection of the laws"" which could include party affiliation, or a particular political viewpoint. The ""class"" must be one that is sufficiently defined, so it is more likely to apply to party affiliation, such as Democrat, rather than an amorphous group, such as liberal. There are a number of nuances to this statute, so if you have a belief that it may apply to your situation, seek competent legal advice."
