"Thanks for sharing. I think it's a great idea to allow everyone to speak freely and share their thoughts in an open format for critiquing. I've watched [similar TED talks](http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_ariely_what_makes_us_feel_good_about_our_work?language=en#t-66168) that have shown this practice gives more value to an employee's self worth, which also leads to more overall productivity. However, I'm a little puzzled by Mr. Dalio's merit weighting/""believability"" index, and feel like I need more information to understand how they attribute those weights. Here's an excellent and relevant excerpt from one of my favorite reads – 2 Second Lean by Paul Akers: *Besides having a 100% emotional commitment, a Lean leader must be humble. What does that look like? Let me give you a tangible goal. Commit yourself to validating, complimenting and/ or recognizing the work of your employees at least ten times a day. Your people should be accustomed to hearing you say things like, “That’s a great idea, Bob,” or “Mary, I appreciate how hard you’ve worked on this project,” or “Actually, John, I like your idea better than mine.” When humility becomes a central attribute of the Lean leadership a vortex of creativity and buy-in will follow. When there is a culture where people know there is not an egomaniac in charge they can begin to grow and thrive. They know that leadership is singular in their focus to give others credit above themselves. There are no politics, no jealousies or rivalries because everybody knows they’ll be acknowledged for their contribution and more importantly, they understand their job is to acknowledge others’ contributions. A Lean culture is a generous environment. It’s generous in giving credit to others, generous in respect, generous in offering ideas, support and help.* *The Lean leader has an ego strong enough to solicit and welcome ideas from absolutely every person involved and will recognize everybody’s contribution as valuable. In fact, a Lean leader gets excited by the prospect of unleashing all that untapped creativity and problem-solving genius that lies dormant in most organizations.* *While many people will be shy and not so forthcoming at first, it is a universal human desire to be validated and respected.*"
