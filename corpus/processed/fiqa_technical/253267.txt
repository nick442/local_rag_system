I mean..Sure, tomatoes are fairly constant, but there is always innovation in supply chain, farming technology, etc. I'm not an expert in the grocery industry, but I would bet that there are many innovations to be made in organic, sustainable farming. These are all reliant on a thriving grocery market. If there was a total monopoly there would be no incentive to improve how our groceries are produced or delivered.
