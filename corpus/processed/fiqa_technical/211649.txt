I grant your point about Lyft and Uber possibly cutting rates once everyone begins tipping. However, [research shows](http://therideshareguy.com/rsg-2017-survey-results-driver-earnings-satisfaction-and-demographics/) that Lyft drivers earn more and are more satisfied with their jobs. That's the kind of company I want to be supporting.
