I see, I want to make it clear that I respect your reply so you don't misinterpret my response but on the other hand, I feel that finance is filled with people who don't know what the heck they're doing. I think half these people were lucky enough to get into the finance world, if that's the case, then grooming at an early age isn't really necessary. Just that you have a nice smile, handsome mug, and are a natural charmer. I think those assets go a long way in talking yourself into a job.. what do you think?
