"Hi Amy, thank you for your article. Got to say however that I tend to disagree. I've been through the venture rabbit hole a number of times. Each one was an experience I'll never forget and wouldn't trade for anything. I learned so much more about how the business world actually works (or..doesn't) than I would have at some more established company. That said, I am also quite sour on the whole VC thing and at my most recent startup we've foregone outside investors and bootstrapped things from the get go. It was probably the best decision we made because it allowed us to be flexible in our strategy and not always beholden to the ""quick exit"" that VC money always drives. However, I realize that not all businesses can be like ours. We started off as a consulting company and moved into build products as our cash reserve grew. If we had wanted to do something big, or fast, or perhaps manufacture something, we would never have had the capital to get it going. Those types of business *need* outside funding, and generally it's only VCs who are willing to take the 1 in 20 bet that startups usually entail. For that, I'm glad that VCs are there, and think they provide a very valuable service and part of our economy. I just don't ever want to have to deal with them again.."
