Yeah, it's a weird way to run a business, and a weird way to evangelize too. But if he doesn't share their views, neither the employer nor employee would have been happy with the situation. I think owners of small businesses should be able to hire based on any criteria they want, even if that means they only want to hire punk rockers, atheists, Amish people, whatever. If it's a company of 10 people who all have to deal with each other everyday, they should be able to form a group of whatever kind of people they want. In reality, small businesses do hire based on whatever kinds of people they want to have around. It's just that most of them are smart enough to be subtle about it.
