"One topic that I've been trying to learn more about is the affects of the low interest rates on businesses and the economy from quantitative easing. Due to the amount of ""free money"" corporations have received over the last 5 years there has been a few interesting consequences. There are several corporations that have borrowed money at little to no interest with the feds intentions of seeing it go back into the economy however instead corporations have used it to buy back stock which was not necessarily the plan in the first place. You could definitely have a unique thesis written about something within that flow of funds. If that makes no sense apologies stupid undergrad here."
