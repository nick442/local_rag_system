There's absolutely nothing wrong with unskilled labor. But Walmart is such a large part of the US economy that an increase in their wage base would definitely have an impact on inflation, so that any broad based increase they gave would likely have a marginal impact on quality of life. It would also make their items more expensive two times over, one, because it would cause inflation that other employers have been resisting raising wages to keep pace with, and the more direct route of increased costs. Whatever you pay unskilled labor, the market will simply raise prices to a level where unskilled labor still have a tough time affording a comfortable lifestyle. Look at Australia as an example of what happens when you raise the minimum wage too high.
