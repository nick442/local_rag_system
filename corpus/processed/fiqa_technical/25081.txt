Part of the behavior is shaped by the environment, most isnt for something that people's been doing for millenniums. People even compare things that's boxed/bagged beautifully. Not bearish on the news because this is long expected. But the brick-and-murder of grocers has been ongoing for a long time due to their deflationary environment and the action today is quite an knee jerk reaction. Amazon taking over the world? Maybe, sure a lot higher chances compare to Tesla taking over the auto market.
