Assuming you don't plan on continuing to use the card frequently, the best advice I've heard is to leave them open unless they have an annual fee. Also, leaving it open with a zero balance doesn't help your credit score as much as using it a few times a year (even for small amounts) because it will eventually shift to an inactive state that is less positive for your credit score.
