Yeah, that's what I hear. I was mostly just screwing around today. I'm an options trader which allows me to make a bit higher returns. I really don't like the setup interface this thing uses, and I ended up just trading market orders for the hell of it all day. I made about 3% today. Still learning the interface and how to maximize use.
