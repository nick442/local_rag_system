Yes. Have been a Product Manager. Key difference is: CEO has responsibility for Capital Allocation. Product Manager doesn't do that. Product Manager has a boss, who is an FTE of the same company, reviewing their expenses. Has to ask permission for a day off. All sort of other things. Not the same. It's a stupid metaphor, designed to inflate the ego of the target. And the targets love it.
