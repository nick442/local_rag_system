No it wouldn't. You'd have to change the law to make **both** settlements and damages non-deductible. In another comment on this thread I wrote about what's deductible and what's not. The **fine** paid to the government is not deductible. The **damages** or **restitution** paid to another party are. Since a settlement is essentially damages and/or restitution paid to someone who's not the US Government, then it's deductible. I haven't read the case law, but I'm sure that the argument is that since they got money that they shouldn't have in the first place, then they shouldn't have to pay taxes on it. Otherwise, what's to stop the IRS from making them pay taxes on phantom income all over the place? The fine paid to the Govt is the punishment, and I'm sure that the prosecutors aren't complete morons and do take the tax consequences into consideration.
