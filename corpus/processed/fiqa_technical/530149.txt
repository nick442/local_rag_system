I lost my job and sold just about everything I own on ebay and craigslist. The folks that bought my stuff made out like bandits.......I took a serious bath! I was lucky to get half the value on electronics, maybe 25% on collectibles and 10% of the value on furniture. The hungrier you are the lower you'll go! Sad but true. I also had some problems with ebay's customer service or customer run-around. Try craigslist first and don't take the first offer, hold out as long as you can to get your price.
