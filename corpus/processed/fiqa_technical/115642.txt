It sucks for them, but it sounds like they brought it on themselves. They didn't hire an attorney to correct their entirely misguided non-response to the problem, then proceeded to make every mistake in the noob book. I 'kinda' feel sorry for them, even though they seemed to run their business in a completely unprofessional manner. If there's any truth in that rambling story, it sounds like they've managed to work themselves into an 'impossible to win' position.
