This is no surprise whatsoever.. 1. Cisco Products we bought 2 years ago are broken in new internet browsers (not a problem on TPLink or DLink). If it was price competitive, it would be ok, but Cisco aren't! 2. We needed 35 large switches for a job. Cisco's pricing was DOUBLE the pricing of TPLink. Cisco was not willing to match (and must be incredibly arrogant to believe that their products are that amazing) 3. Easy-To-Deal-With Distributors here never got Cisco stock when we need it. 4. Cisco's website is HORRIBLE for information. If you need Cisco info, you let Google find it on Cisco's website. Sorry, but we ALL knew this was coming. You pay for the brand name these days. NONE of those 35 TPLINK switches have failed in the past year, even in the middle of summer, where those hallways we installed them don't have AC and can reach >40deg C, despite costing half the price. Cisco needs to stop treating their products as an exclusive/premium club (that's the same reason why Android was able to cut into iOS's marketshare so quickly too).
