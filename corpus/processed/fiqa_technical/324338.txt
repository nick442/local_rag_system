"No, Trump did not say that because, simply, he's not under investigation. The Investigation is about ""Russia influencing the elections."" **Use common sense: if Trump won the nomination of the GOP only in July 2016, against 13 other career GOP politicians that were predicted to win against him, how can it be possible that Russia colluded with Trump to get him win by November?** Did Russia made Hillary, DNC and all the other corrupt, evil Democrats do what they did, so American will hate them? Simple logical question, and please give me simple logical explanation. Stop listening to fake news from CNN, ABC, CBS, NBC, NYT and other MSM ""news""."
