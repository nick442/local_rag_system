Whatever. Go live in an an airplane like I have and you'll quickly realize that the TSA is the least of your problems. Note that I am not particularly fond of the TSA. I think the airlines should run their own security and not be required to use the government's Full Employment For Idiots department, but it's just not that big a deal.
