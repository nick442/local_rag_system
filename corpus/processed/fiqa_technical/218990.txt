> Any ideas on how to execute this? I don't have any licenses or degrees in business, but I think that there are government resources that can help you. The best one I see, so far, is [information](http://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/0,,id=99336,00.html) from the IRS, about federal taxes and business. It is a good starting point. And, I would recommend finding, and talking with businesspeople who have done things like this, before. It is apparent that you are doing that, and I wish you luck. I do hope that you'll keep us in the loop about this, and ask any additional questions. :)
