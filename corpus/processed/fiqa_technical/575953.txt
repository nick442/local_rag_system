I read the “ad” they had. I’m afraid EVERY economic system and our market style are all fantasy methods that don’t conform to reality. Hence our current breakdown and division among classes. So that is a poor argument. The better idea is to figure out what WOULD work, would quell the Real Issues each side observed, and would leave us all stronger in the end. It is BERY easy to criticize anything you disagree with. It is much more difficult to come up with a solution. So let’s come up with a solution. You state your grievances with the system, I’ll then state mine, and we can see if we can find a solution that will handle all the issues brought up.
