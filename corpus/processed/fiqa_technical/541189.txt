WTF - she worked as a Temp and still they were trying to stop her going anywhere else? These agreements are very one sided and demonstrate disproportionate market power. If someone is THAT valuable, they should be working harder to keep them and paying them properly, rather than forcing them to not work competitively. And seriously, and I don't mean to demean the skills of your friend, but a Dental Hygienist? How much damage to a business can she do if she goes to work for another dentist?
