Also a good point. I think that happens, but given the amount of work available here (bay area) it would still be easier to find another job after layoffs. Also considering the increase in average CEO /executive age in the last 40 years, and the increasing retirement age -higher leveled inside promotions are becoming less frequent. But as to the original comment, years ago he did the cost benefit analysis and chose to stay - seems as valid for me to be doing the same (albeit different conclusion).
