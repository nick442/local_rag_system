>Stock down more than a percent What an absolutely nonsensical sentence. Typical daily swings up and down are well within that range. To attribute a 1.2% (at the time of my comment) decline to a crappy NYT article is completely baseless correlation. Also, Starbucks is regularly rated one of the best companies to work for at that income bracket. Part-timers get reimbursements towards education, health benefits and retirement contributions - benefits that many companies don't even provide to their full-time staff. What an absolutely bs submission.
