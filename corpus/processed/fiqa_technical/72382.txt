If you read the entire proposal it's a very long term plan. This would basically equal or potentially surpass Seattle. To surpass Seattle you'd need a major metro area larger than Seattle, there are only a few of those. I don't think they would pick an area smaller than Seattle unless they had plans to literally grow a metro area from themselves (which is entirely possible). The total infrastructure of a major metro area means x # of local people at the educational, experience and income income levels. Real estate should be equal or favorable. LA has everything besides a favorable tax envionment. Public metro could also be a problem. Everything else is unique confluences of all of the requirements. It really depends on what industries will be their focus. Amazon fresh obviously with Whole foods like AWS and their ecom being the largest customer of AWS allowing them to earn large customers like the CIA. I think it would be wise to think in terms of driverless vehicles, drones and 3d printed or fabricated automatic manufacturing and energy in addition to grocery and pharmaceutical. Being near to customers has been one of their primary vectors since forever. Major metro area heat maps would be a good place to start.
