Yes and no. They can not do things related to work for periods of time, often long periods, but not if something big goes on or anything important goes on. They are responsible if anything, anything at all, that happens if shit hits the fan. The CEO is more responsible for strategy than anything else, not day-to-day, so yes, they can just leave..unless something happens. Sure, 99.9+% of the time the COO or regional/segment managers at various levels are dealing with anything that comes up instead of them, just sending them updates, but CEOs are ultimately responsible for this. CEOs travel, get breakfast with customers/suppliers/investors and don't look at their phone for hours at a time. But someone knows where/how to find them or they are in contact soon enough. They can't go AWOL and be out of contact for long.
