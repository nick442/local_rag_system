Yes, start from scratch there, and keep this link open: https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/controlflow.html This is where codingbat starts you off at. As long as you keep that tutorial open, you can always jump back to simpler concepts if you get stuck. The first codingbat problem, http://codingbat.com/prob/p173401, wants you to finish the function `sleep_in()`. It takes two parameters, and returns either `True` or `False`. For starters, try writing: def sleep_in(weekday, vacation): return True This is obviously not correct, but it'll show you the various inputs it used for `weekday` and `vacation`, and how your function definition either passed or failed the tests. This is a surprisingly realistic way to learn programming, as far as how the professionals do it.
