Exactly. People don't seem to realize that a lot of the things they take for granted as being provided by the government were more than adequately provided by private charities until the government stepped in and 'fixed' things..or else they do get it but sweep it under the rug and mumble something about 'its more efficient this way' to justify intruding on the private affairs of others. This is why the founding fathers hated democracy -- the Athenians had no concept of rei publicae.
