"Taken from a website that believes ""CO2 is a product of human breath and is plant food, NOT a pollutant."" (literally the subtitle to the entire website). Oh, look! There goes all its credibility. [Their justifications](https://defyccc.com/debate-about-brief-sos/#more-2768) to that logic are even worse. They are logic-resistant. EDIT: Please no more posts from that looney bin. For a moment, I thought I was visiting a satire website, turns out they're just that crazy."
