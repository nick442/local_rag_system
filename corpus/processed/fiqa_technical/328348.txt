is this supremely tongue in cheek or is this candid i honestly can't tell. I've never known david brooks to be funny so I think he's being candid but that doesn't seem possible. He 'took' a hypothetical high school graduate to lunch and she started quaking at the thought of 'exotic' meats and spreads? He suggests a factor that segregate the upper and upper-middle class from the rest of society includes coded language about david foster wallace? That the surging costs of food (he specifically mentions whole foods), housing, healthcare, childcare, and education aren't what are sapping the purchasing power of a stagnant median income when factoring inflation, but it's the 'cultural codes'? Is this guy sitting in a fucking high speed centrifuge carnival ride waiting for the blood to leave his head so he can type out a troll op-ed in the NYT? I can't imagine any other scenario where someone could dream up this nonsense lol.
