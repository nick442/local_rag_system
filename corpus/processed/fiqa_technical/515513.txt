Yeah because paying millions a year in taxes is somehow less than than paying the nothing the poor pay. This constant belief that services should cost a percentage instead of a fixed rate that everyone pays is a joke. There is nothing equal about going into a McDonalds lining everyone up based on income then making one guy pay for everyone else because he was more successful. Then calling it equal or fair, which it isn't.
