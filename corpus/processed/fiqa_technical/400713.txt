"I actually tend to disagree. This was one of the most watched IPOs in history. Facebook would have benefited greatly from a pop. People would have thought ""wow, they really can do no wrong"". Instead there are endless negative articles about how this is a horrible failure. Sure, financially savvy people look at this and think FB did a beautiful job. They maximized their take from the IPO. But the price of the bad press can't be accurately measured. The benefit in terms of publicity of being seen as a stock/company on the move UP is hard to measure too. Suppose they had priced it at $25 and limited the number of shares they would have gotten less money but they'd also be looking at a massively successful pop on their share price. The halo effect on their business of THAT reality seems to me to have had the potential to be significant. So I'm not so sure, in the long term, whether it would have made more sense for them to get less money up front and get a successful IPO rather than go for the max dollars and have a PR disaster. I think the way things turned out made FB go from an unstoppable juggernaut into a company that can fail just like any other."
