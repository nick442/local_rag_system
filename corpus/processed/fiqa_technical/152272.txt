One of the main purposes of government is to take on risk the private sector can't shoulder (e.g. A bridge, not necessarily a money maker), and sponsor innovation. Regulation of things like fuel standards force industry to invest and adapt - this keeps the economy vibrant, stops complicity in business and promotes growth. People view regulation as an all or nothing thing stifling innovation - not the case. Many regs are good. Look at clean water standards or even the Department of Labor Fiduciary Rule. POTUS numb nut over here just neutered the DOL fiduciary rule which would force investment advisor (brokers) to put a clients needs above their own, when investing in retirement accounts. GREAT for the average citizen- but coopted by the trumpers as government over regulating the economy. Sick. Good example of supporting innovation here. http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2013/01/japans-stimulus-propels-science-spending-new-heights Info on fiduciary rule here (first bullet point). http://www.dolfiduciaryrule.com/
