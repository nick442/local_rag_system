"In economics, there is a notion called the Sunk Cost Fallacy. In a nutshell, the sunk cost fallacy says that human beings tend to prefer to ""throw good money after bad"" because of a strong loss aversion. That, coupled with how we frame an issue, makes it very tempting to say, ""if I just add these funds, I'll recoup my loss plus.."" In reality, the best best is to ignore sunk costs. (I know, far easier said than done, but bear with me a second.) How much you've invested is really irrelevant. The only question worth asking is this: ""Would I invest this money in the asset today?"" Put it this way - any money you spend on ""rescuing"" this upside mortgage is an investment that trades ready funds for a little more equity. Knowing that the mortgage is $100K in excess of the value, why buy that asset? If you could do a HARP, different story - but as you say, you can't. As such, buying into that investment is not the best use of your funds. You are throwing good money after bad. Invest your money where it will earn the best rate of return - not where your heart lead you."
