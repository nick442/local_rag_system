Be careful about your hard and fast rules. I'm flying first class in November because it was $1000 cheaper than flying coach, as bizarre as that sounds. I don't really know why the airline was pricing tickets the way they were (though the time I booked was when a hurricane was about to hammer florida + puerto rico and airlines were gouging people) because the tickets were for the exact same flight and there were very few seats reserved. At best I would suggest you say that public employees / union reps should fly the most inexpensive option (though I'm sure the scenario I encountered doesn't happen often).
