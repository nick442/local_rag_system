I'm not sure how I feel about this. On one hand, the decrease of home prices is very appealing, especially living in a high cost of living area. On the other hand, no tax right offs for charities does not seem like a good idea. If people are going to contribute less to charitable organizations, that will directly hurt the people they are trying to help such as the poor, homeless, and disadvantaged. And these aren't small donations like the average person. These are thousands or even tens of thousands of dollars. I understand most of the money doesn't necessarily reach the ones they claim to help due to salaries, overhead, and marketing, but there are some good charities that try to give as much of the donated money to their cause. I just don't trust our local and state government to put the money into these kinds of programs.
