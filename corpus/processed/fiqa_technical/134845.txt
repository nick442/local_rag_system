He's supposed to be grading him as a board member. I dont think that a board member's vote should be seen as a positive or negative when it comes time for their job review. Edit: Guys, a board member is under no obligation to cast votes in public elections that are in the best interest of the company on which he boards. In fact, I would prefer board members who are autonomous citizens and have lives, values, and interests beyond the companies they board. For example, I would not discriminate against a board member of a bank who also supported Bernie Sanders. Edit 2: People should not be discriminated against in the work place because of their politics, religion, gender, race, sexual orientation, etc. Frankly, Im alarmed that this tenant of democracy is being disputed. I dont want to live in a democracy where people have to have two sets of political beliefs. One they put forth to appease their employer and the other they keep secret.
