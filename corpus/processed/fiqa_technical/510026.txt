UtR had legal permits to have a rally. Antifa showed up with the intentions of causing a huge disruption. The police and mayor have a role in this fabricated counter rally also. There were no American flags, so I highly doubt the people there were the true representatives of the Trump movement. But the media will use it anyway to make us look bad, even when 99% of real supporters do not advocate hate, racism and bigotry. Where is all the outrage when Antifa, BLM or islamic extremists harm people? Is it silenced by the media because it doesnt perfectly frame the lefts narrative, like what happened recently? Trump disavowed all violence. It truly doesnt matter because whatever he said, it was going to be used against him. Obama never disavowed BLM for their henious actions. Its what politicians do, I guess.
