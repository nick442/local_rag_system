>They’re using it as a way to manage their money better. It’s a question not necessarily of spending less but of learning how to spend smarter. And >From a strictly financial perspective, layaway looks foolish. As critics point out, if you were to put the purchase on a credit card instead and pay off the amount in full by the time that the layaway period would have elapsed, you could well pay less in interest than the five-dollar service fee that most stores charge. Alternatively, if you don’t have a credit card, you could put the money you’re going to spend on the product into a savings account or under your mattress. That would save you the service fee and eliminate the risk that you’ll have to pay a cancellation fee if you end up not making all the layaway payments. Basically this. Layaways do not make financial sense. You are better off putting the money into a bank account. Why do people have such little financial control?
