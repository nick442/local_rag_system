Very important. Returning again to the example of the farmer, efficient, liquid markets that fairly reflect the price of a given asset allow that farmer to run his business as cost effectively as he can. That (in theory) lowers the price of his goods for the consumer. If he wasn't able to efficiently hedge, he would have to charge a premium to reflect the price risk he takes on between planting and harvesting his corn. Being pedantic here but single stock futures markets are extremely quiet. If you were the owner of a company and you traded *options* on your company stock (a hilariously common form of insider trading) yes, that would be illegal and the SEC would certainly come after you.
