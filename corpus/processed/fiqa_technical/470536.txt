"I use Old Spice body wash because of their commercials. It is the one time I did it. I watched their first couple commercials and said, ""That was awesome. I'm going to go out and buy their product because of these commercials."" That's the only time, ever. And I'm glad I did, because it inspired them to make more. The Terry Crews ones are the best!"
