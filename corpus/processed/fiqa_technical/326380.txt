It looks good. Only thing that I see as lacking is funding and then how you would recover those costs (cause let's be real, if you give things away, that isn't sustainable) other than selling to the government. Is that a feasible method? Per kilowatt-hour to the customer maybe? Regarding the education, I would look at some of the electrical installations they have (the bundles of wires hanging off the pole) and see if your solution would help that problem. Jobs - great. Sustainability - good. As long as you have microgrids. I thought the benefit to a microgrid was, well, less excess energy. I like expansion also.
