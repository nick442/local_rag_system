The basic fundamental flaw in our reasoning is this: The Afghan will always see us as an invader and they fucking hate us, through and through. If we can get this through our head we will understand why after we train them and arm them, they still shoot us. Trying to bring India into Afghanistan, is simply ideologically idiotic, the Taliban will never give into Hindu Idol worshipers no matter what, Muslims count their pedigree from the Arab conquerors who destroyed Hindu temples and Idols, not look at them as benevolent saviors and India's Israeli connection is simply a no go with the neighbors, no matter how much sun shine we blow up India's ass. Yeah and did I mention the main thing They fucking Hate us
