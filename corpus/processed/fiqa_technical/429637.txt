"Mixing concept does not help to have a realistic mental model of how the world is. There are big problems with MSM, but it's not a conspiracy. To explain the problems with MSM you don't have to mention 1% or secret jeewtings (jew meetings). Furthermore, these groups (G8, Bilderberg, Davos, and so on) are not ""in control"" of the world. They are groups of important people/organizations, but every member is in turn controlled by their constituents/shareholders/voters/members. Are there problems with corporate accountability? Sort of (too short term focus, and other problems with shareholders/management - just like the agent-principal problem in governments). Are there problems with democracy (gerrymandering, first past the post voting, and [propaganda](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/04/how-the-media-became-putins-most-powerful-weapon/391062/), Russian cyber war influence operations, single issue voters)? [Yes](https://medium.com/@thegrugq/the-russian-way-of-cyberwar-edb9d52b4876). Are there some ethnicities overrepresented? [Yes](http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/05/26/the-atomic-bomb-considered-as-hungarian-high-school-science-fair-project/). Does this mean these problems are somehow extremely coupled and have the same ultimate or proximate cause? No."
