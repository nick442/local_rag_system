"Couple other things if you are doing a quick flight to ""get to a meeting"".... First to board so you can continue to work while everyone else gets on the plane.. free internet, newspapers, coffee etc. so you don't have to log in, sign up, pay with a credit card etc. .. first to leave so you can get to your meeting.. as well as bigger seats so you aren't cramped, your suit doesn't get wrinkled.. and you don't have some mouth breather looking at your phone / laptop while you work."
