Like the old Perrier-San Pelegrino case study? Market Basket offers a much much better experience then the local Shaws, A&Ps, Stop and Shops and other crap. I think product differentiation should help them out to gain back customers. Also, people want to be part of the story, which in this case involves a triumphant return of the CEO.
