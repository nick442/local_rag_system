> The solution now? That is difficult. I would say that the solution now would be to raise revenues through corporate taxes and similarly increase government spending on investments aimed at stimulating the economy. Use this time to invest in the much needed infrastructure maintenance and upgrades that the USA needs. These need to be fast-tracked into action and I would therefore consider fixing infrastructure as more important than installing new infrastructure. Thats fine and dandy, but it would never ever pass congress. Im canadian myself, but i know Australia as a strong economy, and at least you dont count on USA for 70+% of your exports like us ><
