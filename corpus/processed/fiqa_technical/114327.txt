> corporate strategy vs. corporate finance vs business development? Broadly speaking there are different functional roles (regardless of title) that are involved in: - Financial Planning and Analysis (FPA). Forecasting, variance analysis (demand, supply etc.), pricing strategy, etc. Depending on your skill set, they can be viewed as basic excel work or more complex optimization problems. - Strategic planning, M&A. Build or buy analysis. Market analysis, etc. This area is more on the capital allocation side in terms of whether or not a company should buy a competitor or build their own product line/service in a given area, geography, etc. Investment banking backgrounds are helpful here. - Communication. There is a side of the business involved in presenting the company's business strategy to outside parties whether that be creditors or investors (stock holders). The 'marcom / IR' (marketing communications, investor relations) side of the business involves presenting the company's strategy, forecast and results to outside parties. This could also include the board of directors or senior management. If you have a strong quantitative background at the engineering level, your ability to take differential equations and translate that to forecasting/econometric time series won't be difficult. But for a lot of people that will be overkill and they only want basic Excel skills and understanding of finance/accounting.
