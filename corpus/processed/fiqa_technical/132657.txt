What would you do if you had the check? Probably destroy it. The goal is to render it uncashable. One way to do such is to have it shredded. If you are uncomfortable leaving them to destroy it, then swing by and pick it up. Alternatively offer to send them a self addressed and stamped envelope. I am sure they will accommodate if you ask nicely.
