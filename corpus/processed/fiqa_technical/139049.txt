I suppose you can calculate the rate of return on buying a home in terms of appreciation, expenses, inflation, taxes, etc. Nothing wrong with that. The method justkt came up with is accurate, but when you get the number out I wouldn't worry if the return is negative. Why? Because you've lived there and enjoyed the house the whole time (I'm assuming anyway that this is your residence you're purchasing). If you come out even the slightest bit ahead, congratulations! You had a free place to live the whole time, plus you made a little money on the deal. If you lost money, then oh well. You still had a place to live.
