Updating this question with a report from Clark Howard: http://www.clarkhoward.com/news/clark-howard/homes-real-estate/home-warranties-not-worth-paper-theyre-written/nDYMR/ Of course everybody is right so far.. Home warranties aren't worth the paper they're written on, but that hasn't stopped homeowners from buying them by the millions. Nor does it negate their effectiveness as a tool you can use to sweeten the pot if you have to sell your home in a tough market. The Chicago Tribune reports that 3 million homeowners bought home warranties last year. Yet at the same time, for six years running, home warranty companies have led a list of the most complained about companies in America out of 500 different categories tracked by AngiesList.com. Basically the point he is trying to make is that home warranties aren't worth it (by and large) for the average home owner. However, if you are selling a home, offering to pay for a warranty for one year for the new home buyer is a sweet incentive for selling your house. At first, there seems to be a contradiction, but not in actuality. If you expect a home warranty to serve you, statistically it probably won't. There are success stories; there are just more horror stories. But just like any sort of advertising cost or other sunk cost when selling your house, having a warranty to give to your new buyer will perhaps help you sell the home faster and for more money. It doesn't mean you believe in the quality of the warranty, but for your buyer, if they never use it; meh. If the use it and it works; hooray! If they use it and it doesn't work; oh well, at least it didn't cost them anything. Offering it to your buyer is akin to offering them a free piece of art. Maybe they like it, maybe they don't, but it was free!
