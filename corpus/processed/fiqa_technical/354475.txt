Should be able to do so. I'm also toying around with the idea of buying the winner 3 months of Reddit Gold, as a prize. Will have to confirm with the banker (wife) first. Also if this does well we might change it up for the next game. $5,000 and enable penny stocks, or something similar. The previous winner would have Reddit Gold until the next game is up. Seems like a fitting prize.
