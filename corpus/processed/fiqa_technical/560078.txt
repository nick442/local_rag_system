Hmm .. let me think about that .. perhaps they will then have less money? Reddit really isn't just a tiny niche website anymore, we get like 20 million unique hits per day or something. If those 20 million finally get it through their heads that they should stop giving cash to the MAFIAA, they will suffer. It's the only way.
