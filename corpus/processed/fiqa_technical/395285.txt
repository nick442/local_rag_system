"Oh I know, just answering the guy's question. Hospitals in Quebec are run as an integral part of the Health Ministry; they are neither for-profit or non-profit, they outright belong to the government (though many have foundations that help them raise private funding as well). Not saying it's necessarily a better system, but I can understand the initial surprise at the concept of ""hospital companies""."
