"I am very tired of the age-old conservative argument for inherent ""dignity in work"". Go fuck yourself. Me not wanting to bust my ass for shitty pay that serves only those individuals that are of a higher class than me does not make me a lazy person. To me, it is more dignified to work for something greater, i.e., a type of system that works for all. Fuck anyone that thinks otherwise."
