no that's not what i'm saying. I've been making the reports, running the stress tests and Movar for the past 2 risk managers. I have a BS in Economics and Business Administration so i'm not really a hard core finance guy. like our first RM was one of the people in the 70s that basically created futures for oil. our last guy was a french dude from EDF. I just feel that i lack their experience and i really don't wanna fuck up so im asking people with more experience perhaps to point the way for me. books, programs, classes etc. Also i think you mistaken my comment about having no idea was on the Crystal Ball sofware. Im mainly a VBA and SQL guy, but i guess to run monte carlo sims i need to learn crystal ball
