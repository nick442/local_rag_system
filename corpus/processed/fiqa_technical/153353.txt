I work in finance and I think the biggest mistake you are making at 15 years old is saying that you specifically want to be a financial advisor. I'm not trying to say the job is awful..but most people who are interested in finance would not at all want this job. You will spend 90% of your time trying to find clients. Most of the time it will be through cold-calling people on the phone through some leads you either get through your agency or you paid for online. Or, you have to start annoying friends and family (never do this). For most people, the job is not about finance and it sucks. Once you finally get a client, now you have a conflict of interest in that you want to sell them the high-commission products so that you get paid, but its often not the best product for them. Its actually very easy to become a financial planner, extremely hard to become a successful one. Instead, what I would do, is consider the wider field of finance. There is so much more to finance than being a financial planner. Do you want to become an expert on stocks? Consider equity research. Do you want to help companies fix strategic problems and make a ton of money? Consider consulting. Do you want to help companies raise money by going public? Consider investment banking. You can google the different types of careers online.
