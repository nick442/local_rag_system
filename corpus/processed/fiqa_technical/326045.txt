Interesting article. I know that this might not be a popular opinion here but here goes.. It can be argued that retarding the economy was a major goal of the Fed in the first place. To prevent the unrestrained runs that 1913-1929 saw which resulted in thousands of investors losing everything. Its true that JP saved the day before the Fed existed but having a government institution do so is an attempt to prevent favoritism from occurring in times of crisis. Yes it could be argued that even in this last crisis favoritism existed as firms like Lehman and Bear were left to die while others were backstopped but I think that has more to do with the interrelationships of those in politics with those in banking. Our global banking system relies on the assumption that not every depositor will want to want to withdraw their funds at the same time. Having a depositor of last resort (the Fed) ensures that even when the population at large panics and withdraws funds the loans that those deposits funded will continue to exist and the broader funding of the businesses that drive the economy will continue. Yes the governance is not always perfect and I would agree that on some level the Fed's policies are capable of handicapping the economy but by and large I think the institution has been a success as evidenced by the continued functioning of our banking system despite a large swath of the population losing wealth in the housing market.
