22 June 2016 would have been the time to do this. Nobody on here can tell you what GBP/EUR will do in the next few months and years now. Brexit is going to happen, which implies lower UK growth and consequently a lower path for GBP interest rates, but this is all already priced in. If you believe the UK economy will underperform current forecasts and/or the euro-area economy will outperform current forecasts, that may imply there's scope for further GBP depreciation. If you believe the probability of a further political shock from a 'no deal' Brexit is materially higher than the market thinks, the same is true. But the opposite of these things could happen also. I would worry less about playing the currency markets as a retail investor and more about what currency your outgoings are denominated in. You live in Spain. Do you have significant GBP expenses or liabilities, or do you expect to have them in the future? If not, why are you taking currency risk by holding GBP balances? Whereas if you do - e.g. if you plan to move (back?) to the UK in the near future - then it makes more sense.
