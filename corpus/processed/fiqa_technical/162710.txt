What somebody is paid is directly tied to the worth they generate for their employer. Management consultants, investment bankers, etc actually generate significant value for their employer. The supply of people that can do these types of jobs is fairly small. Supply and demand sets salaries. The largely government-sector jobs that Reich mentions require the theft of wealth from the private economy in order to staff. Jobs that have true value to society, such as teachers, hospital staff, etc, can and do find private funding without government coercion. The best teachers make hundreds of thousands, if not millions of dollars, in private educational institutions.
