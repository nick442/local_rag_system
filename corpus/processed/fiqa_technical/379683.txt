"**NOWHERE**. You're using an extremely restrictive definition of ""rather"" that precludes the glaringly obvious *correct* interpretation of what I said. Free hint - If someone you're conversing with makes ""no sense"" only under an extremely specific definition of one key word they used (with mutliple other possible meanings that make them basically correct).. *You're* probably the one torturing the language to fit your meaning."
