So you are saying down the road the FED might cancel out the amount of T-Bills and MBS they hold with the Treasury? If you think that you are in that group of left leaning economists who don't believe in American exceptionalism on anything but for some reason carve out an exception for economics. Has anything close to that level of debt cancelation ever happened before? It would permanently damage America's reputation and if it went really bad it would be a disaster unlike this country has ever experienced.
