I'm surprised that [Theranos](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/05/theranos-board-response-deposition-court-documents) isn't at or near the top. It went from $9 billion valuation to more or less worthless, all based on technological claims that never lived up to their claims, and with an all-star Board of Advisors. It's pretty much the definition of a hype bubble with an epic collapse. I suppose it's not as immediate a catastrophic failure as some of the ones on the list, but the size of the failure and collapse dwarfs most of them.
