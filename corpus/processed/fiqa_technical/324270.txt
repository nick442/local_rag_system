I understand what you're saying and I don't disagree. It depends on the case I guess. I don't think it's so egregious in this case because CEOs in the plural usually refers to prominence rather than the majority, at least as the default definition people fall back on when one is not provided. I just don't think people think of the average CEO of One Shop Mom & Pop corp or companies that aren't multimillion or multimillion dollar enterprises. But then again why are my assumptions any better than anyone else's? Maybe my perception of what a CEO is by default isn't as common as I think and by whose criteria is it right?
