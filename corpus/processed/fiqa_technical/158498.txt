Wow, the unnecessary sarcasm is telling of your level of social development. First, please tell me exactly where I said that we have not improved productivity, because, I'm fairly certain I didn't say that productivity hadn't grown at all. In fact, if you're looking for the exact figure, it's about 6x what it was when the industrial revolution started. See.. if you were paying attention you would have realized the conversation wasn't dealing with this issue and you might have been better keeping your nose out. Second, please tell me at least one or two articles you've read about the theoretical limit to productivity improvements. I'm sure you can list at least one, right? I mean, clearly you wouldn't be so stupid that you would just toss out a sarcastic comment without knowing something about productivity growth, or what its theoretical limits are, right?
