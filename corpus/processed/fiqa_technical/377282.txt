Unfortunately 100% of these issues are directly related to private industry’s willingness to use any tool to get the upper hand. It is unwise to hand the keys to thieves just because the cops are corrupt. It is equally unwise to hand power to private corporations just because the government is corrupt. However, as I have often noted before, when you find you are stuck between two disagreeable options, it means you are failing to observe all the variation and subtlety you can manipulate in between and around those options. You are failing to see the middle ground AND your surroundings as opportunities. There must be a measure that will satisfy both our views. We must simply observe more nuances in our subject matter. A quote I have heard from engineers: “The hardest problem is framing the issue in such a way that it can be solved.” a.k.a. our choice of perspective most often defines our limitations, and a change of perspective changes those limitations.
