A wing is a tremendously complicated part. Its aerodynamic properties affect the whole system, plus there are structural issues and fuel management systems. Wings also support the engines. In the 787's case, Boeing outsourced the wing's design. This can make sense: if Boeing specifies the interfaces between the wing and body and engines (physical, electronic, fluids), then all designers should be able to work to these interface specs. However, in this case, that was too difficult a challenge.
