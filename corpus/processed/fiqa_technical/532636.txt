Co-Pays. I know, with good medical, that's just $10-$20. Acupuncture, Chiropractic Care (if not paid by your plan) Eye Exam, often not covered so well. Eye Glasses. Often far higher than the plan pays. Over the counter drugs (update - starting 2011 these can only be reimbursed if they are prescribed, probably more trouble than it's worth), cold medicine, band-aids, ace bandages, heating pad. Birth control (condoms, foam, sponges, if you are worthy) Any of those work for you? Note, regulations permit the FSA administrator to allow up to $500 to rollover to the next year, check if your plan permits this.
