"If it were a friend of mine, I'd do it without having any real qualms about it. If it were simply ""someone I knew"", probably not. Of course, if I trust them them enough to do that, I'd probably just give them the cash and let them pay me back in a day or two. (I'm imagining a scenario where I'm out with a few friends, for example bar hopping or at an event where most vendors require cash and we're talking an amount less than say $50. Any more than that, and I almost certainly would not agree)."
