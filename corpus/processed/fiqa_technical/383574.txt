"yeah, and *I* wish colleges would stop accepting freshman who *don't* know what they want to do with their life. College at $30k-45k a year on loans or your parent's dime isn't the time or place to figure yourself out. Go do that working a part-time job for a few years and then go to school when you have a clue. BTW, excellent advice on ""let the jobs come later"". Sure it'll work out great for everyone. (you're not that special)"
