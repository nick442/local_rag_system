"It's what modern advertising is based on. They're not selling you a product. They're selling you a ""new you."" Modern advertising is based on the erroneous assumption that by buying the product your personality and lifestyle will improve and the customer believes he/she is entitled to the lifestyle they see people in the commercial enjoying by buying the product, at least subconsciously they think that. It's not logical but look at how many commercials barely feature the product or its benefits at all but instead focus on the customers of the product looking cool and popular and successful. Having the logo of the brand of clothing that you bought, prominently displayed on the clothing lets everyone else know how you see yourself and what lifestyle you want for yourself. That's why so many people are eager to pay to advertise a corporation's brand."
