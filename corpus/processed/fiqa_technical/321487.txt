Humans also coped fine before the advent of computers. Does that mean we should revert back to how things were before they came about? Anyway you haven't said why HFT is inherently bad. Well, you did make one point at the start but I think it's a weak one. You said that HFT screws those without access to HFT? HFT system aren't free you know. I could say that me having instant access to stock markets through a computer screws over those who still rely in calling their broker to place an order. Does that mean that trading through computers should be banned? I know you'll probably argue the difference in the magnitude of the capital requirements and that almost everybody has access to a computer but not an HFT system, but where do you draw the line? Should bloomberg terminals be banned? They're out of reach for a lot of investors due to the cost.
