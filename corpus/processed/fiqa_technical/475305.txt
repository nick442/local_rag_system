"says the [Congressional Budget Office](http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/96xx/doc9688/MainText.3.1.shtml#1089499): > CBO estimated the Army’s total costs at $88 million to maintain 1.2 units at home station and $110 million to have 2.0 units at home station for each deployed unit (see the table above). Those costs bracket Blackwater’s total cost of $99 million to perform the same security function. This was directly comparing contractors to military. The contractors are, long-term, cheaper because we do not intend (or at least should not intend) to maintain military presence indefinitely. Police forces or waste removal are not things that will go away, to replace those would make little difference. Please read the entire section of the linked *evidence* before your respond with any more grey lady propaganda. > “Part of the problem with doing studies like this is the lack of data about what the government pays contractors,” he said. we don't have enough evidence to make any valid conclusions, but that's not gonna stop us from doing it anyway. edit: Steven Shooner on May 19, 2005: There's a number of episodic studies since, but there has not been a compelling case made that government outsourcing, particularly this type of outsourcing, saves money."" CBO on August 2008:This paper, which covers the period from 2003 through 2007, provides an overview of the federal costs of employing contractors in Iraq and in nearby countries, the type of products and services they provide, the number of personnel working on those contracts, comparisons of past and present use of contractors during U.S. military operations, and the use of contractors to provide security. He may have been right at the time, but the CBO has now done a comprehensive study of contracting in that situation. read the paper. Contractors aren't a cure all and the implementation lacked effective oversite (included in the paper) but it is cost effective"
