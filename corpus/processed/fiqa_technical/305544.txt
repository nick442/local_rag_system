"The SEC requires a certain format when submitting filings, which generally does not line up with how documents are typeset for printing. Rather than typeset the entire document again, it's just sort of accepted that the format in EDGAR will suck. Typesetters actually call the process ""EDGARizing."" (I'm not making this up, I used to work in the department at a mutual fund company that put together the financial reports for the funds.) My guess is it's a relic from legacy systems at the SEC that can't handle newer formats like PDF."
