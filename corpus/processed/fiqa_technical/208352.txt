>They have somewhat of an idea of what to do, they just can't seem to get it done. I've seen this first-hand, the car's driving off the cliff and you have the entire executive team at the wheel. They all see it coming, but with all the hands pulling at the wheel the car just goes straight ahead. The problem isn't that they don't know what to do, it's the questioning and second-guessing of all the decisions being made. There should be a flow of debate-decision-execution in the boardrooms but instead it's debate-decision-debate-decision.. until there's no more time and the executive team bails out of the car to save their own skin.
