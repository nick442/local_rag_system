When I was about your age I had the same kind of situation. I asked my bank about possible options and one of them was a guaranteed reserve. You lock the money away for a certain amount of years and you get a guaranteed amount of interest on it. I don't know what the current rate is at the moment so you'll have to ask your bank. The good thing about premium bonds is that you can access the money quickly at any time so you could always get premium bonds until you decide what to do with it. If I were you though, I'd make sure my parents didn't have control over my money. Whatever option you choose, keep your money in your name.
