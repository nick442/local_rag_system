I think it's a stupid and unfair practice too. But the above justification is the one that comes closest to making sense. It's not meant to test whether you abuse drugs, it's meant to test your judgment and motivation. If you can't stop smoking pot while looking for a job, either you don't really want the job, or you lack the ability to make intelligent decisions. Either one indicates you're probably not a good job candidate. Also, if it *does* catch someone with cocaine or other drugs in their system, then it's likely they have a real drug problem, since the candidate usually has at least a few days' notice that they will be tested, and they apparently found it difficult to stop for even that long.
