"I was in a similar situation, and used FX trading to hedge against currency fluctuations. I bought the ""new"" currency when the PPP implied valuation of my ""old"" currency was high, and was able to protect quite a bit of purchasing power that I would have lost without the hedge. Unfortunately you get taxed for the ""gain"" you made, but still helpful. In terms of housing market, you could look into a Ireland REIT index, but it may not correlate well with the actual house prices you are looking for."
