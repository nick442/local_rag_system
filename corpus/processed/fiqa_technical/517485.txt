You lack of perspective shows you haven't educated your self on the topic either (see, I can ad hominem too). Have you ever run a business? The fact that on average 34 year olds are on min wage and not young kids says alot about our economy. Instead of punishing employers for their employees' bad life decisions to lead them to want a min wage job at 34, how about we create more jobs and stop outsourcing then to 3rd worlders over seas?
