I think that journalism is going to have to shift to a more scientific based reporting standard to regain credibility. Data driven reporting, with explained methodology for collection and vetting the data; adversarial review of methods and conclusions; greater emphasis on accuracy rather than speed of delivery. I would happily pay for that service. I think the days of good faith trust in journalism as an institution and best practices are gone.
