I know, right? What a joke. If they were a real car company, they would never acknowledge a problem and put in a repair and warrantee program that benefits the customer. When will Tesla learn to cover-up problems, and then do calculations to see if the legal costs they will pay due to the problem are more than the cost of fixing the problem? What a joke of a company.
