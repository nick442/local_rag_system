I've gone through and read your posts. At this point, you're married. With this in mind, when do you just settle on the fact that your wedding didn't meet your expectations? I mean, seriously? You've basically spammed /r/wedding with your complaints, and now you want to use a bad Yelp review to get more money out of this venue? They offered you a reasonable amount, and your coordinator had a damn good excuse for not being at the wedding. Give it up already. You're not going to get a free wedding.
