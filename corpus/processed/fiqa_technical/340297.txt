What we're used to? Who is used to? When I was a MW earner back in the early 90's I lived in a 2BR apartment with three other people and ate lots of those variety 100pack boxes of ramen noodles. The average MW adjusted for 2013 dollars from 1938 to 2013 is $7.30 per hour. Of those 75 years, 36 was below the current MW. Only two years (68,69) it was over $10. But ya gotta have $15 now. Need that cellphone, in-app purchases, netflix and fidget spinners.
