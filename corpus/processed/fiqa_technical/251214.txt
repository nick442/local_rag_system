This may be a controversial opinion, but I think this makes great business sense. They found that the cost of running two battery production lines (60 & 75) exceeded the cost of providing the slightly more expensive battery for every S60 customer. They also gain the benefit of enriching the resale market and providing customer choice. I don't think that most people here realize that 'software locking' functionality is a very common practice across manufacturers and industries to reduce manufacturing costs and provide customer options. What is rare is the ability to 'unlock' after purchase. For example, my last VW was a golf and it shared the same MCU with several other VW lines, including more expensive offerings with more premium features. One of these premium features is a package that enables you to roll your windows up and down from your key fob by holding the unlock or lock button, but my car did not come with that option (in fact, no Golf at the time came with it). The package was not *enabled* but the software and hardware was there. You can grab yourself a USB-OBDII cable and VCDS software and go enable it yourself (and a number of other nice features). All of this said, I think we are in the early days of DLC. Remember when you could by a full game for $50 and play it for a year and *then* some dlc would come out and give you reason to play again for $5 or $10? Then companies (cough EA cough) came along and started to make the DLC part of what you needed to have the full experience on day 1? Yea, that is bad. I am in support of what Tesla has done so far, but the second they (or possibly another manufacturer looking to capitalize on the idea of DLC) starts removing standard bits to make them post-facto addons, we may be getting into a bad place.
