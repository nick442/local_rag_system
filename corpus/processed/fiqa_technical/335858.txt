Yes. Companies increase, decrease, start paying and stop paying dividends when they think it appropriate. If a company has been going through some problems and makes a loss, or even a large decrease in profits, they can choose to stop paying dividends until things improve. Many companies did this during the Global Financial Crisis of 2007-08.
