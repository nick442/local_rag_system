Wal-Mart employees aren't unionized. I have no issue with private unions, but in this case, there are plenty of people that will do the job for minimum wage. The Wal-Mart employees really just don't have much of a leg to stand on and I'm okay with that. If they want better pay and better benefits then they should acquire skills that are valued by society.
