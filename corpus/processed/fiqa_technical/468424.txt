Its only high for some areas if you consider rural people to be sub-class citizens who don't deserve access to modern technology or the ability to escape poverty or move to an urban area. They already pay more for goods, services, transport costs, and travel time. Sure housing is cheaper but a house doesn't get any cheaper to maintain just because you didn't have to pay an enormous amount of money for the land it sits on.
