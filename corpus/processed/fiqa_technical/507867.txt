I cringe every time I see Trump bragging about the stock market - the momentum is irrational and it's going to bite him in the ass before the end of his first term. If he's taking credit it for it going up, then the blame is on him for it going down, right? I just don't see any reality where we go another 3+ years without a normal correction without massive PPT intervention when they didn't even let it fully correct a year or two ago.
