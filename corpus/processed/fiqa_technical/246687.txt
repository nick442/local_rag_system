"When will these guys extract their heads out if their asses and actually have a look at the rest of the world? Take 3 ""countries"" and compare: USA, UK, and EU. USA and UK did fiscal austerity and Unconventional Monetary policy (QE). EU did fiscal austerity and stuck to conventional monetary policy (lowered interest rates). The results: US and UK unemployment figures shrinked since to trough, GDP slowly ticking up, so a weak recovery. EU has seen little to no improvement in unemployment, and is on the verge of a triple-dip recession. Now make up your mind on what the FED can or cannot do for unemployment."
