"No no no no!! Do not spend 25k on a damn slab of concrete when you don't even own the land! You are not ""truly"" the owner unless you legally own the land. I don't care what country your talking about. If you like I'll come over to your place, mix and pour some concrete on the floor, and you can pay me 5 euro. Deal? Buy the smallest parcel of land you can find. Own the land. Pour some concrete on it and viola!"
