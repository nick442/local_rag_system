Here's how the police currently operate.. You are forced to fund them with your tax money, but if they fail to protect you or your property, you get NOTHING in return. If you pay a home owner's insurance company, and you get robbed or your house burns down.. they fully reimburse you. What exactly are we getting for our police dollars? They come *after* the crime, and then put the criminal in jail at *our expense*. We lose both ways. It's pretty clear that insurance is preferable to police, and that insurance companies should expand their operations to include active security personnel to patrol their insured properties and people, while the government's police force should be disbanded and give us that portion of our taxes back. I just want to get more people realizing what a con job government's monopoly services are in terms of what we get for our money. Every where the government services interface with us they involve forcing us to stop in some capacity. Their transportation vehicles stop in the middle of the roads (school buses and city buses), and their solution to intersections (stoplights) are pathetic in comparison to roundabouts which don't leave half the cars stopped at any given time. They spend $4-6 Trillion in wars against desert morons because the other branch of govt which was supposed to round up immigrants who overstayed their visas failed. WE pay for their failure. We've been forced to pay over $16 TRILLION over 50 years for welfare checks to people who are more likely stupid than intrinsically needy (i.e. poor due to circumstances rather than basic stupidity). $16,000 BILLION we could have had to fund on the things we want more of, such as space research, roads, better technology.
