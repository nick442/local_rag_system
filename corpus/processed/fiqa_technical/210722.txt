I'll play this game. Pay me to not kick your seat all flight. Game Theory is fun. Edit: More economics- THE AIRLINE owns the property rights of the seat you are leasing, not you. You may only recline at their discretion. If it bothers me, and I notify the attendants and they ask you not to, you comply.
