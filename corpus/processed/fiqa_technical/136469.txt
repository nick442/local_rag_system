Prediction: costs won't go down. The basis for that is the cost of insurance for health has never gone down in the history of that product mainly due to the fixed market. There is competition, but pricing is so rigged as health insurance companies and employers have completely removed pricing from consumers experience. Until everyone has individual/independent insurance away from their jobs, healthcare costs will never be in check. When employers gtfo of your business and stop providing benefits and people have to buy their own insurance, that is the only time there will be any real market or real pricing in healthcare/medical.
