Jesus Christ dude talk about being entitled. Are you seriously that ignorant of the economic climate we live in? College tuition is increasing exponentially, wages are stagnating, and jobs are going away. The jobs now require higher degrees and more experience while paying less than they did in the previous generations. It is seriously baffling how someone could think the tuition bubble and stagnating job market is completely normal but all the problems are caused by lazy millennial's.
