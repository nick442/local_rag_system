"I agree that the education industry has screwed most young people by lying to them about the value of their education and with ""guaranteed"" high paying jobs. However, the students made their informed decisions and now need to deal with it. Will it impact us? Probably but we can't reinforce a behavior that constantly bails people out of situations of their own making and that of their parents. Parents should be providing better guidance to their children but in many cases they have their ego and bragging rights tied up in this as well. The Education marketing arms promote the belief that you are a great parent if your child goes to an expensive university. I can't tell you how many parents I have heard spouting off about the fact their daughter or son are going to this university or that university. Five years later, the daughter got her degree in social work etc. and is working retail. The son never made it through and are in debt up to their eyeballs."
