"So, let's dump the specified way of doing things because it doesn't implement someone's pet project; is that your argument? ""Executive Orders"" are orders *to the Executive Branch*. Executive-branch agencies *aren't making laws*. If you think things ought to work as your fantasy describes, get cracking on a Constitutional amendment to make it so; stop throwing ""war on whites"" and ""don't believe in science"" strawmen in the mix. They aren't arguments."
