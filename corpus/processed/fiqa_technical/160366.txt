Not so much on the relevant experience side but I have been learning as much as I can about the investment/financial world. That's my thoughts. School counselor play a strong part in society, however, the earning potential is low as is the opportunity for career advancement. The MBA-finance program at my university takes students from all undergrad backgrounds. I would need to take the GRE this month and applications are due at the end of the month. I just wonder if trying to either go into finance without school or opting to enter the MBA program if I were accepted would be a good option. Do you see an MBA-finance being marketable and having greater earning potential than a school counselor (which is about a 46k/year salary)?
