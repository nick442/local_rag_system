When coming to that conclusion, you only consider half of the facts. Yes, all money is debt. But what you miss is that there are other values and assets out there, not just money. These actually match each other to some degree. If the value of all these other assets grow at the same pace as the money supply, then there will be a balance. If one grows faster than the other, there will be inflation or deflation. At least there should be, which is the problem not understood.
