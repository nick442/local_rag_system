It's the maturation of the ads market. Ads are utilizing ML to become more targeted. In fantasyland we wouldn't have ads, but this is not how the real world works. Websites and content production cost money, and ads provide money. You don't seem to grasp this fundamental reality of the market. Until you are willing to either pay directly via subscriptions, or indirectly through pimping out your internet bandwidth and data caps (this one isn't going to happen, because websites fundamentally do not work through a fully-decentralized model), you are going to be targeted by ads. Full stop.
