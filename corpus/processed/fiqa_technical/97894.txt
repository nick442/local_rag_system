>why does m2 seem like exponential? how can fractional reserve do something like that? unpossible. You don't understand fractional reserve then. Please explain carefully exactly why fractional reserve cannot do that. Handwaving does not count. As I posted M2 tracks M1 by about a factor of 10, or do you dispute this? If so, why? If not, then you have to ask the question can M1 grow as fast as it has? It clearly has done so. And if it has, then banks have **not** added money beyond the money multiplier, since there is enough M1 to account for M2. What about this do you not understand? All the data is there for you to check. >Steve Keen says otherwise He is wrong. A bank cannot lend money it does not have. I am willing to borrow a quadrillion dollars. Where is the bank that will lend it to me? See, you're wrong.
