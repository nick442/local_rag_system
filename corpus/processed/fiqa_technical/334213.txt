"The COBRA idea is interesting but I am not sure it will be cheaper than Obamacare - health insurance is just insanely expensive; best for him to discreetly ask HR before leaping. The ""good"" news is that in two years, he should be eligible for Medicare, which should be a better option. So as Dave said, go with Obamacare or COBRA depending on cost and other factors (doctors in network, etc.) and wait for Medicare to kick in. Also, given that his income is going to go very low really soon, he will be eligible for Obamacare low-income subsidies, which will reduce the bill even further. Further, if you get a Silver or Bronze Obamacare plan, you can stash away $3,300 in a Health Savings Account (HSA) tax free, which should further help with expenses. I am sorry your dad is having to leave his job of 30+ years because of some new jerk. However, I hope that the advice you get here will help you find good options for your dad."
