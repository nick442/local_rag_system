They don't have branches everywhere, so if you do need to see a person, you may not be able to do so. Likewise, you won't be able to do cash deposits. Before anyone says it's too good to be true, brokerages like Schwab and Fidelity offer this because the hope is that you'll end up establishing or using other services they offer, so they do have ways to profit from this. Still, compared to the joke that is many other banks, it's a good deal provide you're aware of the two downsides listed above this.
