"I dunno why I clicked on this stupid baity bullshit. You know this stuff only gets clicks because it's about millennial killing the ____ industry. I don't do ""casual dining"" because if I wanted a microwaved meal handed to me by a dispassionate waitress I'd just ask my ex roommate to make me a lean cuisine. No one wants to eat at a place that sells $20 burgers that are still somehow worse than the ones at jack in the box. These places only exist to serve families and millennials aren't eating there because we don't have a bunch of shitty kids and if we're eating somewhere it's probably going to be local or home cooked."
