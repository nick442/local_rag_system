"I don't think it is irrelevant. If everyone is better off working together why not work together? I mean, how can you expect to say something like ""sure, you'll be paying more for YOUR roads, but at least you won't be paying for other people's roads."" If you can come up with even some rough estimates that show we'd be better off, but it sounds like you know we won't be better off, but want it anyway, just because you don't want other people to get a better deal than you. I mean, that *really* doesn't sound like a better society than what we have now."
