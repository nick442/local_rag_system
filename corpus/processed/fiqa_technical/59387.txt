That's because the brands haven't been announced, even internally yet. Keep in mind that P&G is a global company and many of the brands that will be cut from the portfolio are regional ones you've likely never heard of. Additionally, many of the brands will likely be sold to other companies rather than just dropped altogether so you won't lose your favorite products.
