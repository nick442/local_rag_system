"Yeah they should have given it to you. I worked at a Best Buy. It was policy but managers were telling employees to not give discounts so much unless customers were getting warranties. It is amazing how much they care about warranties. Every morning they announce what place they are in the country for each section of the store and the sections that did bad, the managers and assistants look at them with hate as if they should have done much better. And the ones that did great by selling the most warranties and especially their most expensive warranties, gets congratulated by everyone with a round of applause. Before all of this too, they do a huddle with a shout ""WHOS BEST BUY!?? MY BEST BUY!"" Craaaazyyyyy.."
