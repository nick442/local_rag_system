At that rate, European schools will soon be overrun by American students. Here in Germany, foreign students pay the same fees as anyone else, which amount to anything between 100 € and 1500 € ($125 - $2000) annually at public universities, and there are already quite a few US students. Combine this low cost with a high availability of English-language courses and a fairly good employment situation (unemployment is currently at about 7% as measured by German measuring standards, which amounts to about 5% as measured in the US, and native English speakers are still rare enough that just about anyone can earn good money as a private English tutor), and coming here looks more attractive by the minute.
