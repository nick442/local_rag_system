A few things, OP. 1. Begging for expertise is self-limiting. Oh, and you want sources? Get bent. 2. I've worked with Dell, in a vendor-based arrangement for the better part of a decade, on everything from workstation to datacenter projects. My billing rate is $290/hour. IM me if you're interested. 3. Here are the buzzwords to drop for your class. 'Cloud-based infrastructure', 'IT as a commodity', 'Consumer-driven IT', 'Utility Computing', etc. 4. Read the news lately? Heard about any technology companies having problems.. maybe.. something weather related?
