If Walmart violated the law then bring the full force of it down on them. On the other hand the usual reason the local businesses went bust is because they were less convenient and more expensive. The people who shopped in that area decided to stop shopping at the local stores and shop at Walmart instead. Unless you believe everyone is irrational, they would have changed their behaviour for good reasons.
