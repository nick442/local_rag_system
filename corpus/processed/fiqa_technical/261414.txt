Agreed. The number of capable people who are either unemployed and/or willing to work for less in the world is a few multiples of the entire USA population. The USA really doesn't need more workers because they cannot compete with the rest of the world. Unfettered world wide trade might be good for the world, but it is not so good for the bottom 50%-30% of the USA. Something about concentrated costs and diffuse benefits.
