"And that is my point: without specific dollar amounts..this is USELESS information. The problem with this crap information is that some crappy operation will find a reason to pay themselves more for being a ""good boss"" thinking that will make up for any raises. I'd take a better boss over a 5-cent an hour raise (and yes, I worked at McDonalds when raises were 0-5-10 cents an hour..and yeah, I would have liked a better boss for 5 cents). However, for an annual job that pays $500/hr I'll gladly work in horrid conditions with a horrible boss doing awful things."
