"Yeah, it unfortunately doesn't make sense to just retard the orders since they're trying to do two things: A) Avoid information asymmetry from their own market systems (ignoring the fact that they've completely cocked this up in relation to the SIP bit above), and B) Avoid information leakage before they, themselves, can move their own managed ""pegged"" orders off a collapsing inside (DPEG). To achieve A both market data and order traffic need to be retarded, and for B, really you need the market data to be retarded."
