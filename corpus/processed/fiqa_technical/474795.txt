Think about how loans work for you personally. When you charge a $50 dinner for two to your Visa card, you did not earn $50 in income. You did not pay income tax on that $50. The money you use to pay back that $50 at the end of the month is not tax deductible. Interest on a loan is a business expense. Repayment of principal is not a business expense, just as receiving the loan in the first place is not business income. Effectively this means the LLC repays the loan with after-tax dollars. Just like you do with your Visa card. When I do corporate accounting, payment of loan interest shows up on the expense side of the Profit/Loss statement, and it makes the Balance Sheet net assets go down. However payment of loan principal is effectively null. It doesn't appear on the Profit/Loss at all -- and it's a wash on the Balance Sheet, as both Assets and Liabilities fall by the same amount.
