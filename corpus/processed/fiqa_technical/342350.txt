"There are people who believe Equifax didn't actually get hacked, and that the $7.5 million security deal they just received is proof of that. It's still a young and uncommon conspiracy theory, but considering that there are folks who like to scream ""false flag"" about damn near everything, I'd be surprised if it didn't become a mainstream one over the coming months, *especially* if *this current push* to eliminate Social Security Numbers (in their current form) is successful or gains traction."
