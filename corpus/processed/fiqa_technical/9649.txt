The Euro is currently at 1.24. It's been lower than that before. Why do you think there is still so much money behind it? I'm not trying to push back, but do you know something that the market doesn't in terms of a collapse? Also, if you are so positive, are you heavily shorting the euro? I by no means am convinced that the euro was a good idea. But I am convinced that they will do whatever they can to keep it alive.
