I think you have to refer to it (i.e. a hedge fund) as more of a legal structure rather than from an investment perspective. Hedge Funds are generally private investment vehicles that require large capital contributions (whether the hedge fund is set up as a 3c(7) or a 3c(1) structure). Doesn't matter what the relative investment strategy is (long only, long/short, levered, distressed debt, model defined, etc.) 3(c)(7) = qualified purchaser status = Min worth of $25,000,000 3(c)(1) = accredited investor status = less than qualified purchaser status, but still requires certain income limits. Just my two cents.
