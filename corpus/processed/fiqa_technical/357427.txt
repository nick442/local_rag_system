What do you mean doesn't allow private entities to attach to the fixtures? Do you mean fixtures like lamp posts etc? This would only be suitable for small cells anyway. Putting a small cell on a rooftop is silly. A roof site would be a full build site with radios, sector antennas, an equipment cabinet or two, and a power/battery cabinet. If you mean attach fixtures to buildings, I don't believe that. Create a business to lease the space. Bob's Rooftop, Inc., etc. Make sure they carry sufficient insurance and that it includes protection for your building against any contractor error (roof damage, accidentally drill something, damage to cosmetic materials, etc), against fire, and basically anything else. I've only seen cell equipment catch fire a couple of times, both of which were the result of lightning strikes. On the other hand, the bank of batteries they use for backup power is pretty big and has more than enough power to do some accidental arc welding. Are they limited to leasing to a single carrier? You need this all spelled out in writing. PM me the name of the vendor if you are allowed to. I don't need the name of the carrier. You don't need to give me too much identifying information, so there is no exposure for you. Are they offering the $350 or are you asking it? I feel like a minimum of $1000 is reasonable. Try to find out what they will be paid by the carrier. You might be able to negotiate something like 65% of the money the carrier pays. Do remember that the vendor does basically nothing other than make the space available. They don't build the site and they don't maintain it.
