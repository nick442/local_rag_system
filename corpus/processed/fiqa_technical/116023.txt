"I'd start by asking yourself why you need a business plan. Is it for you, or for raising funds? If it's for you, I'd distinguish between ""writing a business plan"" and ""business planning."" Not the same thing - there are much more time-efficient ways to do the latter, such as Business Model Generation and Customer Development. If you're fund-raising, the content of your plan will depend on if you're seeking investment or bank loans. Being clear about the purpose of your plan, and the stage of your business, will help people better answer your question."
