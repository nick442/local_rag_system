"Anecdotal: Deploying a Monolith VPC with Aliyun in China (was late 2015) was quite pleasant for a team trained in managing AWS environments. That said, when we moved from monolith environment to make use of more AWS managed services, we found lots of negative space in performance, support & reliability of the Aliyun managed services. The international Aluyun offer & the China Aliyun offer are slightly different. Gaps exist in compute (no intl ephemeral compute / lambda) & data storage products (no true redshift or aurora subs). That said, if you're rolling your own, Aliyun works just fine. As a final note, the article mentions the ""censorship"" issue as a potential turn-off for international firms. While it would normally be a valid concern, Aliyun's intl SLAs cover this in no uncertain terms and it's a bit of a red herring. The real issue (IMO) is deployment of unique tech or proprietary tech. For example, if you're one of the growing AI companies of the world who sees a unique trained-up xNN as core IP or trade secret, I would be hesitant deploying such a thing to Aliyun."
