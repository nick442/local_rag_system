Someone who spends thousands of dollars and years of work getting a sustainable business degree doesn't do so because they are a corporate apologist. I absolutely did not say that the wrongs committed should be dismissed and made no attempts to absolve them for those sins. All I'm saying is that for a subreddit dedicated to the discipline, you would think users would have a more nuanced approach to the topics and not see things in black and white. But that's clearly not the case with the majority of users here. Many people seem to be mistaking this subreddit with /r/greed. As you said, there's no discourse here. And that's my only complaint, not that there's no forgiveness.
