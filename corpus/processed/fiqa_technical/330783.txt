"> ..a marketing guy who as a teenager invented a color cathode ray tube design that almost beat Sony to a patent on the Trinitron display Or so the entirely unsubstantiated urban myth claims. Except it really doesn't hold any water at all.. Sculley was born in 1939. First of all there was a whole host of patents underlying Sony's Trinitron -- the early ones were applied for by Physicist E.O. Lawrence in circa 1960 (when Sculley would have been 21) -- and which Sony then bought from Lawrence in circa 1966 (Sculley aged 27), when Sony really began developing a practical version of what finally became the ""Trinitron"" display, which they then filed multiple other patents on starting in circa 1967 (by which time Sculley would have been 28+ and by which time he was already out of college -- Bachelor's AND an MBA -- and working for Pepsi). And moreover there is no way that Sculley would have known about Sony's patent application until after it was issued (which I believe was in circa 1970, by which time Sculley would have been 30+ years old). -- BTW [Source for Sony history.](http://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/semiconductors/devices/sony_pulls_plug_on_historic_tr) And if you go with the OTHER version of this story -- that it wasn't a ""Trinitron"" but rather the ORIGINAL ""Color TV"" idea.. well, then it becomes even LESS plausible.. since [Baird first had a working CRT based electric/electronic Color television in 1939, patented a refined version in 1941, and public demonstrated it in the fall of 1944](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Logie_Baird#cite_ref-26) (when Sculley would have been aged < 1 year, 2 years old, and 5 years old respectively). And of course [the FCC was already reviewing prototypes of the CBS, RCA and CTI color TV systems in August of 1939](http://www.criticalpast.com/video/65675075009_color-television-broadcast_Columbia-Broadcasting-Systems_Color-Television-Monitor-Tube) (when Sculley would have been age 10). So, about the only semi-plausible color-TV would be the models that were commercially introduced when Sculley *was* actually a teenager -- either the Westingouse H840CK15, or [the more well known RCA CT-100, both of which started *selling* (at retail stores) in the spring of 1954](http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/17m7kyhqjcm7ljpg.jpg) (the year when Sculley would have *just* turned 15 in April) -- but which BOTH had rather obviously been in development (and having patents filed) and preproduction planning for several years prior (according to RCA filing & licensing patents since 1946).. in other words, long before Sculley had reached an age that can plausibly be called a ""teenager"". Pretty much like the rest of Sculley's claims regarding his ""technology ideas"" and inventions -- it's all retconned bullshit that was come up with during/after his time at Apple in order to make him look/sound like someone *other* than a ""carmel-colored sugar-water marketing guy"". At best.. he maybe had a ""crude idea"" for a ""color TV tube"" -- probably after reading some magazine article on how a plain CRT works -- and (maybe) there is even some kernal of truth to the fact that his dad (not a technical guy either) thought it had enough possible merit to warrant visiting a patent attorney.. who probably (wisely) informed dear old dad to put his checkbook away.. and then somehow junior got the idea (and maybe even started telling the tale) that he had ""been beaten to the patent office by XX days"" -- and of course now, as he got older he probably found out how implausible his story was.. so he had to update/revise it, and he has since so thoroughly ""rewritten"" his own memory, that the claim would now be that not only was it a color TV idea.. but it was a BETTER color TV.. why it was the same as the ""Trinitron"". **Alas BULLSHITTING, even in such a blatant form.. is not a crime; even suckering gullible people into repeating said bullshit.. is also not a crime.** >He also did a pretty good job foreseeing the mobile & Internet revolution (in hindsight it doesn't seem impressive He didn't ""foresee"" anything -- he simply repeated (and attempted to claim credit for) things that had been in existence or development by a multitude of others while he was busy pushing carbonated pop."
