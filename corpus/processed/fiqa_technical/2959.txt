>Actually, I would imagine the terms for credit are better post-bankruptcy filing, than immediately pre-filing. From what I see that's true. Pre filing had no options whatsoever or the terms were so bad that it wasn't worth it. Post filing, while the terms were not the best by no means, at least there were decent options there.
