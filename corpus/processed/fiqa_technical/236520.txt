They make what people buy, although I, for one, absolutely loved my Fusion Energi plug-in hybrid. I hope the Taurus goes plug-in in time for my next car, otherwise I'll have to go with the SHO and waste all of that gasoline. Chrysler has some beautiful cars, but you pay for that beauty by sacrificing reliability. And I'm not sure what's wrong at GM. They have some good quality cars these days, but the exterior design guys don't really excite. Some of the Cadillac and Buick offerings are not too bad, though. It's not like the cars are being ignored; you're seeing more trucks and SUV's on the road because that's what so many people want.
