Location is really what's going for me I believe. The neighboring city doesn't have any hotels or motel but the town I live in have about 6 motels and hotels combined but all family owned. The location that I feel would be perfect for a chain hotel because it'd bring comfort to people who have never been to the area before and it's located downtown on a snowmobile trail and atv access.
