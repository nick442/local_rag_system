Everyone thinks this is so Amazon can keep you from comparison shopping while in an Amazon brick and mortar, but has anyone considered the other reason most companies patent things? Maybe they're trying to protect that so other companies, like best buy, can't use tech like that. I'm pretty sure Amazon benefits more from people looking stuff up at every other store in the world than they would from blocking you in their own store.
