I agree with the premise and vehemently disagree with the solution! Why in the name of all that is holy would you think giving the power to a random group of wealthy people is going to end up in ANY WAY better?! They will take that power, and grab every thing they can! The solution is ridiculous and DOESN'T follow from the problem! If you want a solution, you want REAL oversight! You want people checking these decisions and verifying them that you and the people can trust! We don't trust the market! We don't trust big money! You don't trust the government! That's why I was looking for a solution that works for everyone! Why, after all that work we went through, have you thrown it all away and gone back to this tripe?!
