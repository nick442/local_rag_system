But the benefits in EU countries are better. I don't see a reason to go to the US for an employment, especially if there's a clock of 6 years running on it. I don't know if I can ever explain that to anyone, but moving 8,000 miles to a different continent that feels like a third world country with crazy shootings and shitty healthcare, and than when you finally get used to it and get settled in you get kicked out and besides illegally getting into a greencard marriage you can't stay. they would deport you like a criminal after paying taxes for 6 years. so yeah, in my personal opinion and pretty much every former H1b holder I know, it's not worth it as long as there's a time limit.
