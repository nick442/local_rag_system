"If you're not getting pay stubs showing withholding then you're working ""under the table"", which (a) is illegal, (b) is a deal for the employer because they don't have to pay any of the employment taxes including their share of your SocSec and (c) is screwing you because you'll still need to pay taxes on every dime they pay your but won't have anything set aside for it unless you're doing that yourself. Which I'm guessing you're not. Call the local labor board or whatever."
