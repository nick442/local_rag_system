"I agree the numbers are bunk, however the 900k figure is the ""opportunity cost"" of a moderate income family 60k-100k and not the actual. They are saying if you invested the money you would have spent on the kid and worked instead of staying home with kids you would be close to a million richer. Still don't buy it however. According to their graph it seems like they took the worse case scenario across the board and used that as their base. For instance, the graph states you probably spent close to $85,000 on your kid for child care and education (pre-college). Perhaps if you are a single mom living in new york without family nearby."
