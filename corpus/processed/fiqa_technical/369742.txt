I think your numbers are a little skewed towards urban areas. Also, I don't think he was praising it, but rather saying that it's possible. In many rural areas it's possible for a family to live off ~30k a year. This amount is very possible in a two earner family where both are making minimum wage. It's not glamorous or particularly great, but possible. For example, there's many places where I live (rural Iowa) where rent is 200 a month or less. You can find used cars for 500, and most people around here are handy enough to make a 500 dollar car run from point A to B. Groceries are cheap here, and what's more many people buy food directly off the farm, which is even cheaper. Utilities run about 80-100 a month, less if you have a well and septic. Again, it's not a pretty lifestyle, and doesn't leave room for any rainy days, but at the same time how is an employee's lifestyle outside of work Wal-Mart's concern as long as they show up and do their work?
