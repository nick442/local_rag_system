Thought experiment. If in 20/40/60 years time machines (owned by companies) can generate nearly everything we need to feed, shelter & transport us what should people do? Is that the beginning of nirvana for humans (where time is spent on doing things that have meaning for you) or a nightmare in which the value of the minority of people’s lives is super low given that they aren’t needed by company’s business cases? How should our tax system & social security system then work?
