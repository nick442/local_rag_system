happy to give the likes of Hulu and Amazon credit - mostly for showing that if you give people a legal way to download your content they *will* put more money in your pocket.. that said, the owners of Hulu have been trying to sell it off and dump it for a while now - except they couldn't find a sucker to pay the $2B asking price - for everything Hulu has done right, they've also done a helluva lot wrong (like their ridiculous subscription service, for starters)
