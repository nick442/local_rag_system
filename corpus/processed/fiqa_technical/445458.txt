Dish is just as bad. After my initial 2 year program. They changed the line up of channels I got. I didn't mind the price went up about $15. But to get all the channels I had before I would have to go up 2 tier levels and that would cost another $30 a month. Only reason I stay is satellite has never gone out even in storms and high wind like my cable did.
