Don't worry about Buffett. I have a feeling this will be like Wells Fargo in the 90s where Buffett will make 1000% his investment by the end of the next decade. You can hate them all you want, but does anybody really think that Bank of America is going away? This is like when BP supposed caused a trillion of dollars in damage, and the market cap fell something like 140 billion. In the end, it's probably only going to cost them $20 billion. Life is already going on for the oil spill. Bank of America will get some more hate for a while. They'll get tons of lawsuits, but they'll probably settle for something like $30 billion (one year's earnings). In two or three years, you'll have a company earning $30 billion that is current valued at $50 billion. It's been 4 years since the bubble burst in 2007. Most of the crappy loans are gone already (either defaulted/written off or if they have been paying for 4 years then they are not really crappy at all). There are 4 years worth of prime loans on the books. In 2007, people assumed the somewhat opaque book of loans (mostly subprime) is worth 100 cents on the dollar. Today, people are assuming that the somewhat opaque book of loans (mostly prime) is worth 0 cents on the dollar. Just look around Reddit and see what people are saying about the banks' financial condition, even though they never read any SEC filings or analyst reports. I think (and apparently Buffett also thinks) that the book is worth something between 0 and 100, likely in the upper end.
