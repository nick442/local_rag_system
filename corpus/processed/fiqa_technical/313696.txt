Mutual funds and pensions aren't likely to be too badly hit, as they are largely buy and hold organisations with low turnover of positions which is inherently difficult for hft to exploit. same with index trackers. These guys are exploited most by shower systematic traders thatare themselves exploited by hft. as an aside, finance is also strangely incestuous - pension funds often invest in hedge funds, that themselves often invest in hft.
