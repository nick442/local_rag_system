To be fair regarding the 15% vs 20% difference: disregarding the 5% expected tip increase, *the price of the food has also increased*, meaning that even with the 15% rate you would have been paying more for service on top of paying more for mediocre food. And now you're tacking an extra 5% on top of that. It's crazy, and ultimately it's why a lot of restaurants are doing very poorly right now. The value proposition really isn't there anymore. We need to find a new way to compensate wait staff in America.
