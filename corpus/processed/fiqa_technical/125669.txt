working for a large oil company as an IT person, it's really, really difficult to do business in California. There are so many regulations and standards that it's almost too much for a refiner to put up with. I'm a typical Redditor. net neutrality, moderate liberal, etc.. and I understand the need for the EPA. but too much legislation can really be a bad thing for refiner and customer alike.
