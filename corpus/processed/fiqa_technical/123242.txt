"I think the answer to this is just ""no."" It's not commonly available to have the option to obtain a mortgage at a fixed amount and fixed rate, especially over a timeframe like the 5 yrs you mentioned in your question. There would be several practical problems with such a thing, including but not limited to: As was noted in a comment to your question, it is common to be able to ""lock"" a rate over a period of days to weeks. This isn't the same as what you asked though, because it's much shorter term and it's typically tied to having an offer accepted on a specific house."
