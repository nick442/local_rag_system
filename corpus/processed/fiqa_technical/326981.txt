There's no doubt the merger will cost jobs, and I'm not saying it wont. It's the other nonsense I'm talking about -- the 'asking employees to lie, cheat, and steal, having depressed employees, paying poorly,' whatever.. It's not true. With the exception of the industry shrinking in size, it's a happy place to be employed.
