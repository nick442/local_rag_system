">Apple could clearly afford to pay them more. They could double the salary of all their sales staff and you'd barely even notice on Apple's bottom line. 30,000 US employees working in stores. Double their salary and that's $750 million per year, vs some $25 million profits on the year. They'd be losing about 3% of their profits by doubling salesman wages in the US. Not a huge amount, but certainly more than ""barely even notice."""
