I agree with stopit. I am pulling the lever for Romney. I want to see the Ryan budget come to fruition. Hell, I hope they repeal the minimum wage too. I just hope Republicans aren't chicken shits and come through with their entire agenda if they get voted in come November. I am making decent money. I'll be fine. You on the other hand who is making below the median family income, are going to lose your medicare, social security, unemployment and food stamps so you better get working if you don't have a job. The Republicans are going to send a clear message to free loaders come November. If you are laid off and living off the government its time to find a job!
