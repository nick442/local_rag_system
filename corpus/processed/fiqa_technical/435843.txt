Labor - I have a fairly decent sized extended family. Between us we cover quite a bit of experience in different trades and professions. So as a result when we undertake significant home projects we tend to work together to complete them. We redid my parent kitchen for basically the cost of the cabinets and tile. My grandmothers bathroom when she could no longer get into the tube for the cost of fixtures and tile. We partitioned my upstairs giant bedroom into 2 bedrooms and a bathroom. And lots of other things. We also have a family farm as at harvest time we all pitch in and work long hours. Without that teamwork our entire family would have a much poorer quality of life.
