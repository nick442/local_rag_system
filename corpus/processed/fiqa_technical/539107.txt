You can find Wall Street Financial Analysts and Distinguished Research Professors of Economics to stake any position on the spectrum of economic theory from marxist to anarcho-capitalist. That is one of the ways that you can know that economics is not science. Physicists do not disagree about gravity. History (and logic) show that when govt. raises taxes in aan uncertain economy that wealth will be stck into safe investments and if there is a threat of confiscation (and there will be), then wealth will hide.
