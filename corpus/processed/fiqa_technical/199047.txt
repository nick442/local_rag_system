#####&#009; ######&#009; ####&#009; [**Resource curse**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource%20curse): [](#sfw) --- >The __resource curse__, also known as the __paradox of plenty__, refers to the [paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox) that countries and regions with an abundance of [natural resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource), specifically point-source non-renewable resources like [minerals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral) and [fuels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel), tend to have less [economic growth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth) and worse development outcomes than countries with fewer natural resources. This is hypothesized to happen for many different reasons, including a decline in the competitiveness of other economic sectors (caused by appreciation of the [real exchange rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_exchange_rate) as resource revenues enter an economy, a phenomenon known as [Dutch disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_disease)), volatility of revenues from the natural resource sector due to exposure to global commodity market swings, government mismanagement of resources, or weak, ineffectual, unstable or corrupt institutions (possibly due to the easily diverted actual or anticipated revenue stream from extractive activities). >==== >[**Image**](https://i.imgur.com/Mwn9GmF.jpg) [^(i)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Carson_Fall_Mt_Kinabalu.jpg) --- ^Interesting: [^Dutch ^disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_disease) ^| [^Political ^corruption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption) ^| [^Natural ^resource](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource) ^| [^Coltan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coltan) ^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+ck4slm8) ^or[](#or) [^delete](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&message=%2Bdelete+ck4slm8)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)
