People should actually be able to ask anything they want for something they do. I am sure it was agreed before the case started they would get a percentage of the settlement. Too bad could not just give them 16 million in ticket master credit though. How many clients do the lawyers have? Hundred-thousands? I am sure it is also more than one lawyer, not to mention their clerks etc. Look at when the claim filed, 2003? So 9 years almost of working on a case? I know they have not worked totally on this case but still. This price seems totally reasonable to me. Even if it is not reasonable the clients agreed to it.
