"Strictly speaking, a ""default"" happens when you stop making a scheduled interest or principal payment. So you can ""default"" on your student loan by simply not paying it. What you describe is what generally happens afterwards. So when people say ""You can't default on your student loans"", that is not correct. What they mean to say is ""You (usually) can't discharge your student loans in bankruptcy""."
