So true. I went to my grocery store and bought $7 worth of wings. They were way better than BBW and lasted me two meals. I go to BBW and for $7 you will leave hungry, plus service is terrible, noise is too loud and you're expected to tip. I once went to BBW and they had a deal for boneless chicken wings for like $1 each. Well they are like chicken nuggets that are smaller but more over priced.
