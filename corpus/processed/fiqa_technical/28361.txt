A lot of business sites are subscription only. Financial Times is the most obvious example. The Economist is the other. At least The Economist is making a very strong, healthy profit. A lot of other businesses work on a Freemium model, most obviously Bloomberg. The Bloomberg Terminal costs 24k a year to lease, and it has a stronghold on the financial community. But you can get tons of Bloomberg news and data on their site/channel for free. Why? Because having that wide public reach adds value to Bloomberg--they have access to a lot of industry insiders who exchange tips etc. for the ability to leak info to the public, etc. It's a smart business model and works very well. There are other models that work equally well, but I think a lot of people don't really realize this.
