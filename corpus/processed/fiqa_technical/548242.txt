>> Nothing Mr Obama has been able to accomplish since 2008 – including staving off a second Great Depression and pushing through an overhaul of the healthcare system – appears to have resolved that underlying structural challenge. Wow this is a loaded sentence. So you really think the Obama/Bernanke team has actually *helped* the situation by bailing out the banks and printing trillions of dollars? I think a lot of people would take issue with that sentiment. I would also argue that Obamacare is not only immoral, but resolves none of the issues in American Healthcare and will only exacerbate them. It was just a huge handout to politically-connected healthcare companies, and a push towards total a government takeover and forced socialization of healthcare.
