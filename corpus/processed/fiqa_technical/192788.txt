Not all Bachelor's are the same, DeVry is different in quality than Havard or even a decent state school. And it's not 1/3rd of the population, it is 1/3rd of just adults in the workforce. If High School is worthless and a substantial portion of Bachelor's are worthless, then those that have quality ones have an edge in employment. Having a bachelors already puts you at an edge over 2/3rds of the work force in looking for a job, even if the degree isn't as meaningful as it was in the 1960s or 30s. A more relevant question is how employers value a BA or even Associates Degree, as only about 42% of the workforce even has the minimum of an Associates. Ironically, even though the 25-29 groups has 64% with some college education, only 44% have and Associates, only 34% have a BA, 2% more than the 25 and over age bracket. Best educated generation is barely better educated than the average adult of all age cohorts.
