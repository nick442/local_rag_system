"I think it's an argument for Keynesian economic policy, basically an abridged version of this paragraph from the Wikipedia article: Keynesian economists often argue that private sector decisions sometimes lead to inefficient macroeconomic outcomes which require active policy responses by the public sector, in particular, monetary policy actions by the central bank and fiscal policy actions by the government, in order to stabilize output over the business cycle. ""private sector decisions"" are bottom-up: millions of businesses and individuals make economic decisions and ""the economy"" is the sum of what they do. ""monetary policy actions by the central bank and fiscal policy actions by the government"" are top-down: central institutions implement measures that are intended to have a positive effect (such as reducing unemployment) on millions of individuals."
