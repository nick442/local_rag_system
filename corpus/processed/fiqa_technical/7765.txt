Let me tell you about a country called South Korea that was totally devastated after the Korean War, but even though almost everybody was living in poverty after the war, parents made every effort to educate their children, and now South Korea is the 12th largest country by GDP. It isn't the lack of money that is the problem. It is the lack of parents who care and in many cases, it is just the lack of parents. Disproportionately, kids in juvenile detention centers are missing at least one parent from their home or lack parents who care. No amount of money or nanny state legislature will make a significant dent in this problem or this problem would have been solved long ago. Unless we go full blown North Korean style brain washing authoritarianism, the problem, responsibility and solution lies with the people.
