Are you aware that you are not beholden to Walmart? Are you aware how much profit, not just revenue, but outright Walmart posts every year? Do you know how much of that profit goes towards the employees who made it possible? Are you aware of the anticompetitive business practices they use? Are you aware that your tax dollars are subsidizing the food, shelter, and medical care of Walmart's employees? Walmart makes plenty of profit, they owe it to their employees to pay a fair wage. But you seem to think people dont deserve to be paid fairly so we'll just have to agree to disagree.
