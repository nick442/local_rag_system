"Even less reason for influencers to tag it then? The way it works for us is our PR company pretty much gives us a list of their affiliate ""Key Opinion Leaders"" (KOL) with all of their rates. We then choose a couple after looking at their pages. PR firm sends out product samples then lets us know when the post is up. PR firm pays KOL, we pay PR firm. So for this to come up as ""advertised"" on insta, my understanding from the above thread is that the KOL needs to tag it. However as the client we would absolutely not want ""Paid"" or ""Sponsored"" to show up if we can help it, it destroys the illusion. Last thing I will note is what /u/pwnicholson posted about regarding FTC rules. That is fine if you need to tag it for regulatory reasons. We don't in Aus, so it won't happen. In saying that, the data looks juicy so we'd probably do it here and there to see the numbers, but otherwise the 'illusion' is very important imo."
