all of the unconstitutional efforts by government to eliminate hardship have only led to more hardship, corruption, and a nation which consumes more than it produces. the citizens of the USA are not brave enough to be free and will experience the consequences. the crumbling illusion of prosperity is supported by incredible amounts of debt, panic level low interest rates, and obscene levels of welfare and warfare. it is not the role of government to eliminate hardship or run an economy. an economy(including the availability of healthcare) is to be crafted by the free choices of consumers and producers. you can't legislate prosperity. and freedom includes the freedom to endure hardship.
