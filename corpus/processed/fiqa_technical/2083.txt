"While I agree that highly processed foods, including plant based meat substitutes, are probably not the best things we could be eating, damning them with scare words like ""chemicals"" is unhelpful and certainly doesn't account for the bigger picture. All food is made of chemicals- water is a chemical, broccoli is full of various chemicals. Looking at the specific nutritional profile of meat alternatives most of them fall somewhere between marginally better and no worse than meat based foods. Getting protein from leafy greens, whole grains, nuts, and legumes would probably be better, but meat alternatives still make it easier for people to adopt plant based diets, and see them as viable, which is likely to have a positive health impact, or again at least be no worse than an omnivorous diet. You also discount the non-health related reasons that people choose these options. Many people may be choosing meat alternatives because of concerns over animal welfare or the environment. Other people may simply like the taste- many options are different enough from meat to not be comparable from a taste standpoint, and many plant based meat alternatives are much better tasting than similar frozen convenience foods made from animals."
