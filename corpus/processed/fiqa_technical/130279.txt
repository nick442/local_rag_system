If you take out a personal loan, rather than a mortgage or car loan or hire-purchase agreement or other loan that's for making a specific purchase, then you can do whatever you want with the money. Send it abroad, burn it, spend it on expensive whisky -- it's up to you. The country you want to send the money to might have rules on transferring money into the country, but there will be no impediment at the UK end.
