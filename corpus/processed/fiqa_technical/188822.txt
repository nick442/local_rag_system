Well consider this, even if you bought some at every all time high prior to this one, you would have still made a profit. I was kicking myself when I passed up an opportunity to buy some at $30. After its wild ride up to $1,200 and subsequent fall, I made sure to start buying around $250. Bitcoin is not going away. There are hundreds of different cryptos out there, but Bitcoin is the gold standard and it is becoming more legitimized every day. Regulators and governments passed it off as a fad for years but are now paying attention because people are actually using it to get around all kinds of bottlenecks that exist due to the structure of the current global banking system. If you feel like it will continue to be used more extensively and become more scarce over the next several years, then it is probably worth investing at least something into it. Of course, never invest more than you can afford to lose. Full disclosure: I hold some Bitcoin but I am mostly in Ethereum right now because I think there is greater potential there. Bitcoin is pretty expensive right now and Ethereum is still catching up to it in market cap. I think we will see some great practical uses for it in the coming years. There are already some major players involved, including the Russian State owned banks.
