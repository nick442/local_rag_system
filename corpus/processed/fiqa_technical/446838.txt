Cutting the size/inefficiency of government is generally an unpopular topic on r/economy. However the question I always wish to ask these folk is : If the size and scope of government has generally historically increased since WWII, at what stage do we say enough? There has to be a point where the inefficiency and burden of the state overwhelms the tax base it operates off.
