Any system of social organization that sees enough generational poverty that people like yourself are advocating that others don't have the moral right to procreate is an abject failure. If you don't see that, then there's no point in discussion. You can look down your nose and lecture 'responsibility' to poor people all you want, but you're only revealing an abhorrent lack of ethics and compassion on your part and a dismal failure of our economic system as a whole.
