"Yelp is a plague upon this earth, especially for small business owners. I'd say it's symbolic of a flawed, cancerous line of reasoning that is somehow making its way even into the health care system as well as other sectors of business. That is: survey feedback. Don't get me wrong; consumer/customer feedback is important. But, one has to take into account that usually only people with poor experiences tend to voice loudly, so results become skewed on the spectrums of consumers. Furthermore, many reviews are simply insane -- i.e. biased experiences due to a bad day, another customer, or something else entirely unrelated or unreasonable to their experience. Don't even get me started on peoples' bias towards Asian restaurants that aren't galvanized into PF Chang's style service. Why the fuck do people go to MBA programs if they're going to put so much stock into such ""ratings"". It creates needless stress while providing a poor lens for understanding things. At best, it's a tool not a religion. At least, I presume people running the business end of hospitals are MBAs. The customer is always right is only true insofar as how you treat them at the time of service. Secondly, reviewers aren't always right."
