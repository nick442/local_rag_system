Hopefully this doesn't come across as me being a jackass (I'm really not trying to be), but.. Is this just your assumption, or do you have a source for that statement? I'm actually interested -- would love to read something more in-depth. All I could find is [this](http://iphone.appleinsider.com/articles/17/01/20/report-claims-apple-music-pays-more-to-record-labels-in-royalties-per-stream-than-spotify), which actually indicates the opposite is true.
