Still a tough sell when the banking sector is so underwater. IDBI reported that 20% of their loans were non performing. Think on that, 1 in 5 loans are probably going to default and need to be written off. While it's the extreme case, the NPL ratio for the public banks is about 10% which is an insane ratio. This isn't an issue that's going to go away, the government says they want to consolidate but that just means you're forcing a bad bank to merge with a bank that's even worse off.
