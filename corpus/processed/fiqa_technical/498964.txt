"> Yahoo's security team was often denied funding and sometimes kept in the dark at Mayer's direction Also: > The ""Paranoids"" — as Yahoo's security team is called — often went head-to-head with Mayer and lost, a number of security employees recently told The New York Times.

Shortly after they had multiple security breaches due to their lack of security. She's directly responsible.
