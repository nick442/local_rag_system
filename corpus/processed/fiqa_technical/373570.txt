"Doesn't make any difference. Reconciling is important, but if you are constantly checking the online balance in between (because you are NOT keeping track of a running register balance) then the fact that you *eventually* ""balance"" is irrelevant.. And in fact if you're NOT maintaining a register, then you're really not ""reconciling"" (or ""balancing"") anything.. you're just looking over a bank statement and saying *""OK that looks right""*; or, as is more likely in your case saying *""Waitaminute, that's not right .. Oh, I guess I forgot about that transaction.. and that one.. and that other one.""*"
