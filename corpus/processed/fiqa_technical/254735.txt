That is a loaded question. The American taxpayer isn't subsidizing their business model. We are paying for a social safety net, yes. But no one is forcing Walmart employees to work there, or to not take other jobs to supplement their income, etc. You are looking at the situation with a very child like perspective, as though they are victims. If anything, rather than targeting one large company and blaming them, we should focus on promoting legislation that increases the minimum wage, since many other businesses have the same practices as Walmart, and always will as long as the law lets them.
