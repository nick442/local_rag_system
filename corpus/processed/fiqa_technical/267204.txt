Okay, your point on near lowest in 40 years stands. > Also the numbers are skewed because in the 50's So, demographics skewed it in the 50s (and 60s and 70s). Okay. What about current demographics? We have the largest percentage of 65 & up in the population. Over 75% of this group is not in the labor force. Do you believe that not having to work once you turn 65 is a sign of success? Edit: looks at user name. Looks at time of reply. User name checks out.
