"> But I've also gotten some cheap shit at Menards. I'll second that. Their discount brands, like ""Master Force"" and ""Tool Shop"" are definitely lower in quality. I have a rotary tool that I got for like $20, and it's done the job that I need it to do, but if I were doing lots of detail work or crafts, I would have spent the money on a Dremel. I buy my tools at Lowe's, since I'm willing to spend more on quality items that I want to last (they have plenty of cheap crap, too), but things like wood, screws, and landscaping materials are cheaper at Menard's, especially when they have their 11% off the entire store sales, and they're not cheap alternatives."
