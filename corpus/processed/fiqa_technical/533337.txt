in 20 yrs your generation will vote itself into office and be in control. like gay rights..climate change..healthcare..abortion etc are promises now. so will be your school debts and kids education. You will vote and argue for or against forgiving your own debts and make higher education a right. You will just keep digging the hole you complain other people made for you like the generations before you. problem will be solved. have a beer and relax.
