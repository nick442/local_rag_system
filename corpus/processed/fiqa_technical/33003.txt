$900 seems like a fair cost of minor repair. As a landlord, I repaint and repatch the walls if there are any holes. Labor is also expensive now a days (especially here in the West Coast). HOWEVER, this is why there is a security deposit. To make sure things like this is covered after move out. NOW, you could ask the landlord for an itemized invoice of the cost of repairs. Which then you could rationalize the costs of repairs. I usually take the security deposit, then deduct any costs that were need during repair. And give the remaining difference back to the tenant.
