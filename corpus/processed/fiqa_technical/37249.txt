">You are just being weirdly semantic and also failing to distinguish between North and South America. They are not both collectively called America. Nobody groups 2 continents together like that. Stop embarrassing yourself. You are trying to save face by saying America is a country. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas >What point? I said Canada was protectionist and Canada is in the top to protectionist countries in the list you provided. Because of your cognitive dissonance, you couldn't even understand the chart. LOL. it is 10 biggest country. And all of them have low tariff and shows is not protectionist. Again, I showed that you made completely big fool out of yourself multiple times. http://www.businessinsider.com/wef-countries-with-highest-trade-tarrifs-2016-10/#t11-sierra-leone-138--sierra-leone-has-high-customs-tariffs-which-account-for-about-45-of-government-revenue-according-to-the-world-trade-organisation-9 **Yea. 28% to 14%.** **Nowhere near 1-3% I showed where Canada was.** LOLOL. Just sad. A trumper says all those countries are protectionist. Yet, all the data says opposite. Are all trumpers argue like this? This is pretty sad man. You cant even follow this, you got pretty rough life ahead of you. >What data would you like? America being increasingly protectionist and the stock market being at an all time high? https://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/26/us-stocks-boeing-earnings-fed.html I already used your own data against you so in a way that is me using data and you've presented none. Lol. None of that data says anything about protectionism. Are you joking? This is pathetic, mate. So lets recap Makes absurd claim. that Russia, China, US(calling it America), Canada are all protectionist. -> Shows data that completely proves them wrong. Not to mention Russia is poor as shit. -> Yells out unrelated comment. ""bu bu bu venezula!""-> Tells him I've never brought up venezula. -> bu bu bu I say they protectionist cause they on top 10 list and couldn't even understand simple chart -> Shows data proves opposite and tell him low tarrif rate of 1-3% -> bu bu bu I now want to see other 185 countries. This is hilarious and just pathetic. I feel bad for you. Wait, are you Russian? Is that why you chose Russia as great protectionist country? LOLOLOL. No wonder your life must suck. Blame it on trade and globalism that will help. Your lack of cognitive ability must have nothing to do with it."
