Wait, I know this one! Because.. 1) Cities suck, and people only put up with them for good jobs in the first place, and.. 2) Their one redeeming quality is tons of great jobs, and.. 3) Millennials don't have the 20+ years of experience needed to get a job anywhere in the US currently, and.. 4) It costs a hell of a lot less to live in the middle of nowhere than in Manhattan? Wait, remind me again why people *ever* decided to live in cities? \#1 ain't good enough, even for a non-Millennial like me..
