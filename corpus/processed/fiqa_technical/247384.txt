This *actually* shows the power ***of being a first-mover in a niche market***. This has nothing to do with how the firm was run. When you are the first one in, you have, in effect, a monopoly (as there's now a humongous barrier-to-entry for everyone else).. They could run the firm into the ground, and they'll still be around in 10 generations..
