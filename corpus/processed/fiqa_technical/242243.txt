I feel sort of conflicted here.. literally every pair of shoes I own is a size 13, and they all fit perfectly. Every pair of shoes I've owned for the past 15 years has been a size 13.. I've seen nothing but consistency in this. Is there a difference perhaps in womens sizing, or what gives? My own life experiences just dont match what you're saying at all :/ At least as far as length goes.. maybe everyones just varying levels of fat and its a width issue for them ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
