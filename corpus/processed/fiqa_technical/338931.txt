If I could get places without driving myself, I definitely would. This country is beautiful when seen from the road, but to really see it well, you have to be the passenger, not the driver. The driver has to keep his or her eyes on the road and only glance at scenery. The passengers can look at whatever they want or do whatever they want. Bring on the self-driving cars!
