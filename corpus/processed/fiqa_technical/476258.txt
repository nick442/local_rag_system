> In Europe we act as if workers are people not a commodity to be prices as low as possible. It works both ways. Regulating workers wages can decrease the number of small companies starting up. This is because entrepreneurs starting up might not be starting off with many millions in the bank so they may be fearful of paying too much. Same goes for job security. Regulation and wage minima are generally bad for small innovative companies and not so bad for big established firms who just want to protect their market share (and for whom compliance costs peanuts as a percentage of their revenue). My two cents on this are: Much better to create a redistributive system whereby the state pays everybody a basic level of income. Then the market can be freed up and people's entrepreneurship can be fully leveraged.
