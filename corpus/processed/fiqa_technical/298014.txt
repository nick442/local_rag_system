"I work for a health billing company. It is completely the provider's responsibility to bill your health insurance in a timely manner if they have your health insurance information on file (it sounds like they did). If you can gather a copy of your EOB (Explanation of Benefits) from your health insurance, it will likely say something to the extent of: ""claim was submitted after the timely filing limit, therefore no payment was made. The patient is not liable for the remaining balance."" Don't let the hospital/physician bully you into paying for something they should have submitted to the insurance in the first place."
