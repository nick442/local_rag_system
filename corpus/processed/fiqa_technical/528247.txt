I see where your coming from. I was not arguing for punishing Verizon now. I was simply saying companies in general should stop trying to sell services they already provide for free, and this was a damn foolish idea on their part in the first place. Honestly, I am not that sure of the specifics in this case. I would argue it would be fine for them to charge new and monthly customers this fee. I do not think it would have been fair to try to increase prices on customers who have a contract with them. Do you know who they planned to charge this fee on? And thank you for not just down voting me because you disagree.
