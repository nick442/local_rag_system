If Trump close loopholes for big corporation not paying taxes, while also reducing taxes, it will work. Any ideas how much taxes Apple paid last year? How much of Apple's money is off-shore? But your plans are good too! Really. They also do not involve raising taxes. You have no idea how many people are not audited by the IRS, how big is the under-the-table payments, black market, etc. Just fix the system. And when you close loopholes, to save tax money, companies will need to spend more capital and hire people to reduce their taxable profit.
