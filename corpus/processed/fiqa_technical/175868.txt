I've heard that Atlantic City was pretty drab these days from a friend who wandered through several years ago. At the same time, I feel like there's no reason it couldn't be rebuilt with the right vision and proper funding, and maybe some tax incentives. Fill in some of the archipelago to reclaim some land and revamp the whole area with hotels and convention centres, upscale bars and pubs and restaurants, and I'm sure people would line up again. I suspect that's a big, big endeavour - but surely not impossible. It's a matter of reconstructing a pulse.
