A few things. First, in order for Tesla to succeed there needs to be a market for electric cars, Tesla alone cannot create a market for electric cars. They could have the best battery design in the world and nobody will care if nobody wants electric vehicles. The next is Tesla got a head start, and is a darling company in the public eye. People love Elon, and Tesla is portrayed as a very cool company in the public eye. The last thing that I think is important is that I don't believe Tesla released anything about their manufacturing techniques. Knowing how a battery is made is cool, but if you can't build it efficiently and affordable t doesn't matter if you know how it's built.
