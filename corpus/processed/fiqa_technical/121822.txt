Pot can affect competency. You are naive and biased to believe otherwise. You argue that it never could cause problems. This is because YOU have never seen it happen. The problem is you then discount any observations which go against what you have seen and been told by others. Others who have a vested interest in legalizing pot in all ways. I know people who function just fine after a period of time from smoking. I also know and have known people who don't. Who prior to smoking pit where very timely and efficient at their jobs, then after starting to smoke became lazy and uncaring during work. With most, the ONLY thing that changed was they started smoking pot. So you go ahead and avoid truths because you do not like them.
