Not true at all, one is a hard to calculate double tax that stifles growth and adds weird, usually unexpected, incentives into the market, and the other taxes wealth. Even the bluest economist should support an end to corporate tax, because it becomes a way to tax lower-class citizens higher than they would without it. Every middle-class family has a 401k or other IRA which is being taxed due to corporate taxes. Corporate taxes also are passed on to low wage consumers, depending on the elasticity.
