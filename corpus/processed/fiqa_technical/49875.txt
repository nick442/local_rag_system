You could also interpret these actions as satisfying consumer wants, instead of as some sort of conspiracy. Businesses want to make sales. That's not news. That's no a secret. I think it's pretty safe to assume everyone knows that. If you, as an individual decided to pawn of responsibility for for purchases on other people, you'd be seen as ridiculous, and rightly so. This implies that you think this doesn't apply to you, but does apply to many other people. That makes you an elitist. Exactly how much better than everyone else do you think you are?
