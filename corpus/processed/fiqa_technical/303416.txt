In general, Roth IRAs, are associated with the individual. Unlike 401(k)s for which the business holds the retirement account in the name of the individual. So, although the company may have helped you set up the Roth it is in your name and you can continue to contribute to it. Wikipedia has some helpful information here. It should be noted, however, that sometimes businesses set up special deals with retirement service companies or brokers that hold Roth IRAs so you should check with the particular company/broker that holds your Roth.
