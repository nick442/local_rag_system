Microsoft is already paying Firefox for distributions (which may explain why Google is cutting them off). I wonder when Google will pull the plug on Ask.com? Ask is the largest subsidized advertiser on Google by an extremely wide margin. They pay nothing for it.. all they do is run AdSense ads and Google takes a cut. Crooked as shit, if you ask me.
