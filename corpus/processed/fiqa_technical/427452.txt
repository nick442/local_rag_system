> My point is that we need to address the economic slowdown before the spending crisis I agree with you. Suppose nothing worse happens, (the Euro doesn't fail, China doesn't go into recession, we don't have all-out war in the Middle East) and we just sputter along as we've been going. It will take another 5 years or so for the employment rate to get decent. Meanwhile, there will have a large underclass than will have been unemployed for almost a decade and may be permanently unemployable. We'll have another ~8 trillion in debt. Let's (re-)build the roads that are falling apart, the railways, the bridges, the water systems. Repair the aging school buildings. Start an urban CCC, one that goes into decaying urban neighborhoods and tears down the worst of the houses and repair the ones that are in tax default, renting them out with the CCC workers getting first dibs.
