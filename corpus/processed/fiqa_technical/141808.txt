"In the sense I mean, ""luck"" is that which didn't come from you that, without which, you would not have been successful in the way that you were. So, being born in the developed world, for instance, is some ""luck"". There's also the element of being dependent on an environment existing that you usually are not aware of, but said environment is actually somewhat fragile, and if mistreated, might fall apart on you, making further success therein impossible. Think of a fish. Is it ""lucky"" there's an ocean? Yes, because if the fish pollute it and suddenly the ocean itself is making them sick and preventing them from being successful, it should be counted as ""lucky"" that there's an ocean, and the fish ought to do what's necessary to keep their ocean healthy. Replace ""fish"" and ""ocean"" with ""person"" and ""economy/society""."
