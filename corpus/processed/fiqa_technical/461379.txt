Well, I didn't know those existed. Author might not either. I'm also not aware of the trading requirements in Europe. Could be different than US. In any event, I think most who are concerned are (1) doomsayers who've predicted 30 of the last 1 recessions, (2) don't understand the point of leverage and are irrationally scared of it, or (3) understand leverage can be good but think this will be used in a bad way.
