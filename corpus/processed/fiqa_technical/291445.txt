Ok, so as a result of the Equifax breach I placed a credit freeze on all my accounts. Just to verify my understanding, if in the future I want to apply for a home loan, open a new bank account, etc.. I need to individually unfreeze my accounts with each of the credit companies right? (e.g. I can't just unfreeze one, I have to unfreeze them all)
