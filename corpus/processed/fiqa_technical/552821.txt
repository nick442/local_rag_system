I didn't say it wasn't a joke, just correcting your comment with some first hand knowledge. I don't think bitcoin is a useful currency either. I used it for awhile, who is going to wait 10 minutes to an hour to send a payment? Not me, debit is faster. I don't even own any more, sold all of it for cash. The irony is the network wasn't scaled with demand, and now fees are out of control.. its not useful as currency and you're right to think so. That being said, I do think the underlying technology has some potential, specifically smart contracts which are on Ethereum. Again, I don't think it should be a currency, but the being able to run decentralized and trustless programs is pretty damn cool IMO.
