Yes, you can. A friend of mine once did, don't know the reason why he was so foolish and couldn't use the debit card instead. I think maybe out of curiosity or he was drunk. But I know the consequences, the bank people asked him to pay all the previous debts relating to the card the same day or he was going to be paying alot of interest to them as a penalty. So, he did pay all the debts the same night.
