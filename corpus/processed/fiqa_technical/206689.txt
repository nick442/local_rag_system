"> How did you make the transition up the ""ladder"" thus far? I applied online for jobs that were above and beyond what I was currently doing and did well enough in the interviews to get hired. For my current position, I found the hiring manager online and emailed him directly to tell him I was the person he was looking for. But I don't think that approach will get me any further. >How is your LinkedIn connection with executive recruiters? I don't have one. I know that's an important next step but I'm not sure how to do it. Do I just email a bunch and introduce myself? I expect to be in my current position for at least 2 more years (realistically 4) and I would like to start cultivating the relationships but I'm not sure what to do. I think that getting on some boards would be a similar step but again I'm not sure how. >Would you be willing to take a salary cut for a title change? Within reason. Maybe 10%. >Does your college have a program for networking with alumni? Probably. I have a pair of Masters' Degrees in my field from a top-25 program. The issue is that the alumni I network with would need to be executives and they're harder to engage."
