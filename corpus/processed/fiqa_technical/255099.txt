For me, the two reviews made me reconsider my interest in Tesla, which makes them quite unfavorable. Even if Tesla takes care of the issue quickly and gave me a loaner, it's still hours if not a day that I wouldn't have a drivable car. And I'd have had to call customer support, wait, be there when the car is picked up for service, etc. All while waiting to go to work/store/for a drive with family. I'd much prefer to own a car that just didn't get problems for the first few years. Looking at other people's experience with Camries and Priuses and even Malibus, (and my admittedly short experience with our own Camry so far), that's not an unreasonable expectation. Since these two reviews switched me from being interested in Tesla to being apprehensive, I'd say that they were quite unfavorable.
