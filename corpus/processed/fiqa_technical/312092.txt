Monopolies are much more likely to come to power if there is no government. Monopolization is a common result of capitalism. Government is the only entity that can challenge a monopoly. The wars we do not want are the result of our elections. If we had no military and no government, an outside government/military could invade us. That's a much bigger problem than us going to war in far away places. Stupid, uneducated people won't go away when there's no government. Currently, they are relatively passive. What happens when they can't afford food and the laws are vague and uncertain? They will riot. Or worse. Revolt. Is your private police force going to shoot them? Imprison them? Who is going to pay for that? We have far more control over the government than we do over big, multi-national corporations. How do you and I have any influence over Comcast or Bank of America? We are helpless against them. Fortunately, they don't have that much power right now. That would change if they took over the police and court system.
