Although the article makes a good point I can't help but think their blame is slightly misplaced. Employers wouldn't be able to take advantage of workers if the workforce didn't come from a generation that has been taught since infancy that doing what they love is more important than money. We all think we're entitled to our first career choice and so a lot of markets are flooded with eager applicants. Supply and demand says that employers would be idiots pay someone a lot of money to do what thousands are lining up to do for free.
