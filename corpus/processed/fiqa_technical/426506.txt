"I actually interviewed to work at the SEC as an ""industry transplant."" I was surprised to learn the limits of the SEC's power - namely, they cannot compel anybody to show them any documents - even ones financial firms are required to hold. When firms do ""cooperate,"" they tend to make it as difficult as possible for investigators. All the SEC can do in the end is sue the firm, and that's a long drawn out process (I understand now why there are so many settlements). What I learned, however, is that the SEC needs more people like myself who have worked in the business. Most people who interviewed me were attorneys and (sometimes) accountants. Their experience in the financial industry was limited to working at legal firms who did financial advisory work. Many simply don't even know what to look for. I'm still waiting to hear back, but there are a lot of lawyers who are sick of working industry jobs and would love the pay and work environment of the SEC - so it's tough to get a position there."
