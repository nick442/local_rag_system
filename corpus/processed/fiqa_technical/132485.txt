I remember first encountering an ANA unit. I asked one soldier what his rank was. Private (lowest rank). I asked him about his training. 4 weeks, part time. He only had one day of shitty hand-me-down soviet rifle training. He seemed kind of afraid of it. About 40 in his unit, all but three had similar levels of experience. Ok. Not sure how that is supposed to work. I asked who his superior was. “There’s one Sergeant with 2 years experience in the unit who makes all the decisions”. Anyone higher ranking than that? Nope. Any officers who can, I dunno, make tactical decisions so you guys aren’t just randos running around with rifles? Nope. The Sergeant had an old RPG. “Do you guys have any artillery, air support, etc?” Nope. What do you do if you get in a fight and you’re outnumbered? “Ask Americans for help”. Mmkay. This probably isn’t going to work very well, I thought. Spoiler alert: It did not work out well. Not my area of expertise, I was never responsible for training or involved in units who were (however I did meet a fair number of ANA units). My impression was that none had received equipment or training that would make them suitable replacements to take over security in the event of a NATO withdrawal. This was 8-10 years in. From what you still see in the news, I imagine this is still the case.
