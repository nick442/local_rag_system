They take in a *lot* through Corporation Tax, so it'd be relatively unfair to non-business owners and non-shareholders to put it onto VAT and income tax. In the Starbucks case, they'd still want to get the money out of the country so would end up paying no more tax than now. One alternative along the lines you state, though, would be to crank up capital gains and dividend taxes to match what's taken in by Corporation Tax now. After all, those are the other ways (than income) for owners and shareholders to extract value from corporations and would be tricky to dodge unless you're outside of the EU.
