>The issue I had with it is long distances. Well, you need fast-chargers to travel long distances. Tesla has these along all major highways. For example, I make regular trips to Lake Michigan every summer, about a 250-mile trip. There are two Superchargers on my route. I will plan on hitting one of them. But right now I have to plan on hitting a gas station along the way. So it doesn't seem that different to me. You're going to point out that takes longer than fueling with gas. Yes it does,typically about a half-hour. I accept this because I save so much fueling time for the rest of my driving, when I can fuel up at home. You might not think that's a fair trade. I do. That's why I like EVs and you don't.
