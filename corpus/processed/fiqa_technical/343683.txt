I agree. My biggest disagreement with the article is the stigma against the rebates offered by exchanges. These are offered for providing liquidity to the markets, and are an added incentive to both market makers and institutional (and now retail) clients to post orders and provide liquidity for other participants to interact with. We have some market making strategies that make very little in gross P&L (i.e., capturing the spread), but net P&L is much higher due to the rebates we get for maintaining quotes and providing liquidity throughout the day, especially in illiquid/small cap names where spreads would be wide if they relied purely on retail/institutional flow. I'm surprised the author didn't talk about inverted exchanges (Bats Y, Edge A) where participants receive rebates for taking liquidity instead of providing it. Those models essentially reward people who need immediate execution - does he see a problem with those or should they be exempt?
