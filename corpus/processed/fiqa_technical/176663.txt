"If you're not convinced it's ineptitude - willful or otherwise - then ask yourself how life, property & casualty insurers, endowments, foundations, etc (in addition to the bevy of DB plans that are adequately funded) have managed to survive as long as they have. You should ask yourself: Was this just ""bad luck,"" beyond the control of managers? Or were these willful decisions by financial professionals, within the context of highly competitive industries, to divert resources elsewhere with the *hope* that taking a riskier path would ultimately pay off?"
