You don't need to make even close to that much to start doing this. All you need is a job where you hire your company out to another company to do work. Any kind of consulting work is usually done in a similar fashion. You can't expect people not to take advantage of tax breaks. That's like asking parents to stop getting subsidies for child care because it's not fair to bachelors. To say that people who do this don't feel anything is quite insulting.
