I've been starting to invest in real estate myself, and [this site](http://www.biggerpockets.com/forums/categories) has been incredibly helpful. It was started by a professional real estate investor who wanted to create a community for helping investors of all types and experience levels. You can learn a lot just by reading the various posts, but I highly recommend creating an account and introducing yourself to the community. There are many members with a lot of experience who are happy to help newbies.
