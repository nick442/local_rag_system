> ING is the fourth major bank to settle with New York and U.S. authorities over “stripping” information from wire transfers that would have identified sanctioned parties’ involvement. In 2009, Credit Suisse AG agreed to pay a $536 million fine and Lloyds TSB Bank Plc agreed to forfeit $350 million. Barclays settled in 2010 for $298 million. > Later that year, another Dutch bank, ABN AMRO, settled a case with the Justice Department, agreeing to pay $500 million. lol that's not even half a quarter of profits.
