I'm guessing the gist of your comment is that if Amazon were to use HQ2 to staff new projects that explode in headcount, it will be able to grow the new campus exceptionally rapidly. I guess that's a possible future. I would, however, be mildly surprised if upper management has enough of those sorts of ideas ready to go to round out a 50k campus. To reiterate: I highly suspect this is just Amazon alleviating its real estate crunch in Seattle. It's not being built to fulfill any grand secret plans so much as just being able to gradually spread out a little more. (Not that there won't be any grand secret plans, just that it's not the point.)
