> But, banks won't allow it. It's not just banks - the Republican party seems to have had it in for the US Postal Service for the past decade. Possibly because it's seen as trustworthy and effective, so they want to make it worse so people won't have things like that associated with government. In 2006 at the height of their majorities in Congress they managed to pass that bill that forces the USPS to lose money rapidly, and has been forcing it to lay off people and close post offices and chip away at how convenient and effective it is. But, postal banking could turn that around. With it the USPS might bring in some income to balance out the expenses of that 2006 legislation. People might even object more to post offices closing, or try to reopen them. It would undermine a major part of Republican policy.
