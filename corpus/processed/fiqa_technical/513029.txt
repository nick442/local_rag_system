There's a story about a guy who became a billionaire starting from nothing. As a kid, he would use his allowance to buy vegetables at the farm and sell for a big markup in the city. By 21, this little business of his was doing very well and he was saving more and more money every day. Then.. he finally married a billionaire widow. And that's how he became a billionaire. Rich Dad, Poor Dad is sort of like the joke above. It gives you the inspiration and common sense advice (save, don't waste money, etc, etc.) But it misses key points, and the book is full of false information he portrays as real life examples. Nothing wrong with the book *as entertainment*. But actually *doing something useful* to pursue your goals is 100x better use of time. It's not even close. There is no magic advice in any book that will teach you to be comfortably rich, and this book is no different.
