Not exactly, patents don't give you anything. Patents just prevent others from doing what it is you did. Whether you exercise your patent is unrelated to having gotten one. Also, patents in reality produce inefficiencies and detract from innovation. I don't care what they're theoretically designed to do partially because theoretically, we're all equal even though in reality we're clearly not.
