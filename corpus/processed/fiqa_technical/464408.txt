Yah, I think the weakness in the contract is that if the charge were disputed and it ended up in court, the hotel would be forced to show who placed the review and that it was from a particular wedding party. It wouldn't have to be libel to be contractually binding behaviour. For example you might sign a contract with a writer stating that they would be financially penalized if they wrote anything at all on Yelp (or any other site, fact or fiction). This goes for other perfectly legal behaviours as well. Actors have signed contracts that stipulate that they remain fat to keep their job, for example. Its legal to lose weight, the actor is certainly 'free' do so, but they might also lose their job.
