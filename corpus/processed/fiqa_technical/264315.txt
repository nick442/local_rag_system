Having not seen the full raw data of the study, I would just like to put their sample size in some perspective: Amazon has 341,400 employees. Statistically even in a very good system its entirely possible to have 100 that didnt have the best experience. Thats a sample of .00029 of the employees and that doesnt even get into the other consultants/contractors that might work with the company a modest amount. That doesnt really speak fairly whatsoever to the intents nor effectiveness of the implementation of Jeff Bezos or anybody else really at the company. I have not read of a company thats ambitious or effective in any respect that hasnt had some stressful moments.
