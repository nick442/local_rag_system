Indian workers are hard to manage. I work in Japan as a consultant managing offshore development projects. The Indian companies are not doing that well here. They cannot deliver, and the Indian companies themselves are very slow to move. They are not even landing the jobs because Indian expat execs are too slow. I have noticed that they are using development centers in the US and China as well to support global contracts. The reason is that Indian workers stay on the job for little longer than 3 mos before they move onto a better position. They are only interested in status climbing because the companies are nickeling and diming them while management charges much the same as a local Japanese integrators. On the few occasions they have tried to recruit me, even though I agreed to take a salary reduction (lehman shock) and meet their conditions, they were too wishy washy made the proposal late and never hired me. Overall way too flaky.
