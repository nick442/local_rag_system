Where did I say we treat all crimes equivalently? Didn't. But I sure as hell will say fraud is fraud and it doesn't matter if you steal pennies a bunch of times to make a million or you steal it all at once. The crimes ARE accurately measured in the article. The $3.7 trillion is not a 'wrong' number nor is it a lie.
