Lmao thus truly is Reddit isn't it. You know who only works the bare minimum? Spain. They all close down for hours in the middle of the day to take a nap. Sure, it sounds nice, but guess what their economy is like? Absolute shit. They aren't creating next gen products that change the world. And they aren't global leaders in the business world like the US.
