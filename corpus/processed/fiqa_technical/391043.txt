If anything special situations/value will be the most profitable strategy going forward. You can take advantage of quant funds reliance on probability and correlation and inability to do real price discovery. An idiosyncratic corporate event (i.e CEO's sudden retirement) that happens to google would lead to quant funds selling off Amazon, giving you a great opportunity to buy the unwarranted dip.
