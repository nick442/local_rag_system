This is total bullshit. I was an average B student in Physics at Caltech. I decided to go to Med school, but barely made it through Organic Chem. So I took it in Summer school at UCLA, in a class of 300 pre-meds. I was top man on every test. The difference in the average quality of the students was huge.
