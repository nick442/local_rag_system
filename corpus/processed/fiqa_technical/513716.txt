While Apple is undoubtedly tougher at negotiating, the premise is of the question is false. Apple pays more money per stream than Spotify, whose user base is primarily on their free tier, which has almost no revenue at all and gets to pay out lower royalty rates. Apple Music doesn't have a free tier. Apple Music also apparently runs at a profit, while paying out more per stream. Free tiers are awful for pretty much everybody involved.
