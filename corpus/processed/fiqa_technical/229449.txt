There are just too many places to get decent pastries these days. Practically every podunk town has a Starbucks or something similar, and even most supermarket bakeries make pretty solid muffins, danishes, etc. The niche for quick, sweet snack food is pretty saturated with stuff that's better quality and still cheap enough to fall within most people's price window for such occasional items.
