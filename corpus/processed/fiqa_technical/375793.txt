I read an article recently that talked about how there are kind of two camps in autonomous driving: the slow progress and the giant leap (made these names up). The giant leap advocates say that continuing to add features won't get you to full autonomy because at the end, you still have to take that leap. With your description, if the political environment prevents the leap, it's not hard to imagine that in 15 years all the cars on the road will have the features you've described, and we'll find that no one is really driving much anymore. Then it'll be kind of an easy decision to implement a broader networked system. Hopefully it doesn't take that long but that seems like a potential worst case scenario here.
