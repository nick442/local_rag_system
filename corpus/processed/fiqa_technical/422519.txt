"A word of caution about betting against an entrenched technology/way of doing things. In the 80's there was a battle for PC operating systems market share. (Microsoft won). You would think that this new breed of computers (desktop PCs) would be bad for those selling the old type of computers (mainframes) - and it was. However I read somewhere that IBM still makes something like *$8 billion* per year selling obsolete mainframe computers - mainly to the likes of banks where there is no obvious advantage to upgrading to newer systems (and there is the risk that if they do, customer deposits go up in smoke or whatever). So I guess the lesson is to think of reasons why people won't all upgrade from their existing way of doing things: - afraid of technology - lack of broadband/ too slow internet connections - those who paid for an expensive TV in the last few years and don't want to buy a newer ""smart tv"" - those terrified of complex UIs for using the various streaming services - think of the classic example of those who can't program a VCR, now imagine them with a qwerty keyboard trying to watch something etc."
