"No, I didn't read the article (I never claimed to have), and no, I don't know the person's credentials (I never claimed I did). This thread seems to be directed towards hiring a music major as a security specialist, which is an irrelevant point to argue. The point to argue is whether they are qualified, which has nothing to do with a degree if they've worked for more than a year. That was the entire point of my comment. Tl;dr Her degree is irrelevant and everyone is attacking the scapegoat. EDIT: I also realized I referred to her as ""he"", which was a typo."
