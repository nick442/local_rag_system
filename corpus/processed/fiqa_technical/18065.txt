"I looked into the ""We buy houses"" people when I was trying to sell my house a few years back. The amount they are normally willing to pay is far below value. If I was going to take that little, I would just set the price at that amount and sell it to somebody, maybe making a young couple really happy getting into a house they couldn't otherwise afford."
