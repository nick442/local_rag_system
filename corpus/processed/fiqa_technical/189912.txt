"I think often times the personality traits that make founders so successful are the same traits that keep them from giving up control. By the time you've made it to the top of the mountain you've proven everyone who ever said ""do this"" wrong. So people saying ""step aside"" isn't going to do anything but convince you that you can prove them wrong again. It's easy to say ""put your ego to the side"" but when your stubbornness and smarts helped get you where you are, it's not easy to look inside yourself and say ""I'm not the best guy for this."""
