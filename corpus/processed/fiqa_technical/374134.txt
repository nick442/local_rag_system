Amazon is always going to be pointless for screws and nails because you can't ship that economically. You can't do items like lumber, sheet rock, or concrete due to weight. You can never ship large items due to size. Amazon fits for knick knacks that are expensive enough to ship, but small and light enough for Prime. Their weakness is still needing to ship things. Plus it can't be underestimated that you need to return shit because it doesn't fit or the contractor needs an exchange for something else. Makes sense to make a Home Depot run; stupid if you need to ship it back to Amazon to do an exchange. This only works if Amazon enters the warehouse showroom space and has exchanges, returns, and purchases done face to face. This is something Home Depot already has the advantage in. Amazon may attempt to kill them with a thousand cuts with light bulbs, hammers, and small parts.
