> “Uber has done a U-turn -- at the employment tribunal, the firm argued that they were not a taxi company, but an app putting customers in touch with drivers,” Rachel Farr, a senior lawyer in the employment, pensions and mobility group at Taylor Wessing, said. “Now Uber says that they are no different from a traditional mini-cab firm with self-employed drivers.” But, but; they're so kicky! The fascist 'normals' are just trying to protect their buggy-whip dinosaur business models, and all that archaic 'compliance with laws' nonsense.
