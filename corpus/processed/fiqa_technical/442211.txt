"Its amazing how little users in the business subreddit know or even have a basic understanding of bitcoin/cryptocurrencies when people are literally investing [more than a billion dollars](http://blocktribune.com/september-promises-busy-ico-market/) and as the op article states is worth over a hundred billion dollars in just 9 months. Some of you are calling it a ""bubble"" and while that may be true for the entire market (leaving some of these startups dead in the water), bitcoin is merely gaining traction as it has done since it was worth pennies. It rises, dips, rises higher, dips, rises to even higher heights. There is revolutionary technology in cryptocurrencies that people in the forefront of business should be paying attention to. Some of the cryptocurrencies are going to succeed, it's just a matter of which ones. Bitcoin is not a bad bet."
