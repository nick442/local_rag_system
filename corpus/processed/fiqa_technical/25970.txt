There were a couple key differences between Keurig and Juicero. * Keurig was going after a piece of a much larger pie. Most homes and offices have a coffee maker. A few homes and almost no offices have a juicer. * Keurig got a big boost from the office market. Much passive aggressive ink has been spilled over office coffee makers. Maintaining one is a huge chore no one wants to do, and everyone complains that whoever made the last pot of coffee did it wrong. Keurig let everyone have the coffee flavour they like and ended the debate about when to start another pot. I've never heard of an office juicer, so Juicero didn't have that initial market to introduce people to their product. * Keurig isn't that expensive. Keurig kept their prices low enough that people saw the premium as a reasonable convenience fee. Juicero went straight into luxury status symbol territory with their prices. * Keurig got people hooked, and then started the shady DRM. Juicero started off with the shady DRM.
