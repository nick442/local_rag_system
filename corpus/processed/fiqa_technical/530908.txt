This doesn't look particularly unreasonable, but a few notes: It's a little misleading to say that 45% of his paycheck is gone. Roughly 6% of his gross pay went to his 401(k). That money is still his; he's just chosen to save it in a particular way. Depending on the choices he's made for his retirement savings, he'll also reduce his tax bill right now and/or during retirement by making these contributions. Some of the other costs also go to social programs that may pay you back (granted, they may not always be as good as those in Europe, but it's not that you'd get nothing in return): In any case, $130K/year is certainly a lot on a global scale, but San Francisco is a very expensive city, and housing costs in SF have risen a lot lately. You've nicely summed up why a lot of families unfortunately leave the city.
