"I'm far from certain, but I'll take a swing at it. Equilibrium term structure models ""predict"" a term structure that we don't observe, and no-arbitrage models ""correct"" prediction to match reality. An analogous place to look would be implied volatility surfaces. Black-Scholes predicts a specific implied volatility surface (or rather, it assumes the surface is flat). So I think a Hull-White-style no-arbitrage model might work by addressing the difference between predicted and actual surfaces. Like term structure models, you'd take a set of observed volatilities and somehow plug them into BS so that the BS price didn't imply arbitrage opportunities within the observed set of options. I'm not at all certain that I'm being clear, and there's a distinct possibility that I'm saying/thinking something stupid."
