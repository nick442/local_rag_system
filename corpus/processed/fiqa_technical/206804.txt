"It is not a ""better world"" when all we've done is trade one set of victims for another. There is nothing ""Fair"" about FORCING one citizen to do what the mob thinks they should. ""Life, liberty, and the pursute of happiness and all that"" does not include being able to force other people to do what YOU want with THEIR property. This is theft by any reasonable definition. The only civil rights that are ever morally justified are *before the law as a citizen*. Your government should treat all its citizens equally. There is no sense in which this ought to translate to the private sector except under voluntary conditions, not by the state shoving a gun in your ear and forcing you to do so."
