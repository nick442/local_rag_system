The only real option (long-term) is for businesses to move to other areas and re-distribute the population, which would allow for cheaper areas/homes to become viable options. This has actually begun to happen really, not many people may be aware yet of what's occurring in Nevada today. Apple just joined Tesla and Switch in announcing billion dollar investments in Virginia City, Nevada. Google also made huge land purchases. The tech population has begun moving into cheaper areas already and many people will follow, to cheaper homes and lower costs of living. All people are to blame for this real estate situation, everyone is just looking out for themselves and they are all concentrating in specific areas - naturally costs will rise. Re-distributing the population geographically (businesses + wealth) will relieve this kind of stress happening in focused areas.
