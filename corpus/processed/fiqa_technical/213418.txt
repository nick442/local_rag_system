"Keynes is hard to defend. He makes some very basic arithemetic errors in the core of his work. However, the best defense of Keynes (at least with respect to his intellectual contribution) is Roger Garrisons ""Time & Money"". Garrisons argument is that Keynes is right if you dismiss time as an irrelevant variable. Time is a complicated issue and Keynes was brilliant in the way he managed to describe an economy that exists outside of time. Keynes more or less admits that the solution is very short term with long term harm. He just doesn't think the long term problems are all that bad. I really don't think he would defend what his work has been twisted to advocate."
