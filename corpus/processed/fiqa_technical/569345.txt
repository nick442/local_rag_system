To be fair, customers didn't really have much of a choice in all of this. The stores looked like you'd expect a week after an impeding apocalypses had been announced; the shelves were almost completely empty, for weeks. Can you really call it a boycott when there is nothing to actually buy? I think the employees deserve the credit here.
