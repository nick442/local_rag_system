"This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](http://larrysummers.com/2017/10/22/one-last-time-on-who-benefits-from-corporate-tax-cuts/) reduced by 90%. (I'm a bot) ***** > The analysis from Hassett, chief of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, relies heavily on correlations between corporate tax rates and wages in other countries to argue that a cut in the corporate tax rate would boost returns to labor very substantially. > The authors include no corporate tax detail, no recognition of the impact of the tax proposal on asset prices, and no treatment of the budget consequences of tax cuts. > The newest boldest bit of claim inflation regarding the tax bill comes from the Business Roundtable: &quot;a competitive 20 percent corporate tax rate could increase wages sufficient to support two million new jobs.&quot; This would, coupled with job growth projected even in the absence of a corporate rate cut, take the unemployment rate well below 3 percent! I would be very interested to see the underlying analysis. ***** [**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/78551e/summers_one_last_time_on_who_benefits_from/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ ""Version 1.65, ~233281 tl;drs so far."") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr ""PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome."") | *Top* *keywords*: **tax**^#1 **corporate**^#2 **rate**^#3 **cut**^#4 **investment**^#5"
