"I'd change my attitude a bit. ""I'm not very good with saving money, unless I know I need to."" If you could act as if you absolutely needed to save, but took the subsidized loan and set it aside, you'd have a good start. As a student, it would be difficult to raise money the way an established working person might. A low interest credit card, a 401(k) loan, Home Equity Loan, etc. If you feel it would be too tempting to set it aside, don't take it. Your question is fine, but the answer isn't financial, it's behavioral."
