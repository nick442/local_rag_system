"On the one hand the author says this: >the forcible seizing of land from individuals by government without just compensation deserves to be called tyranny. Then in the next breath says this: >Property owners merely need to pay the communities from which they receive benefits through their exclusive use of land the exact market value of the benefits that they receive. There is no way to ""pay the communities"" except through some form of representation: Government. So what the author is stating is that people who gain value of the land they use must pay the government a fair market value for that use. Also known as taxation. But the author takes it one step further: ALL land should be in the hands of the representatives of the community (Government) and everyone must lease said land from the community (Government). Yeah. That will work well."
