Like its Pilsen sibling, the bar has an industrial, eco-friendly aesthetic courtesy of reclaimed materials cobbled together by design firm Alter Ego. Bartenders serve cheap, hipster-approved drafts, craft brews and a tasty selection of cocktails. An open kitchen equipped with a Roto-Flex pizza oven cranks out huge thin-crust pies with seasonal toppings, sold by the whole pie or slice. The neighborhood is the focus here, so expect affordable price points (that means few drinks over $8) and a rock n' roll vibe (we love the $7.50 pizza-PBR-Jameson shot combo served daily). Hit the ATM before you arrive -- it's cash-only.
