">Clearly military screening is far from perfect. The suicide rate for all members is higher than average. You make a jump in logic here which is not falsifiable that it is screening practices which lead to higher suicide rates. >Add transgender in and the likelyhood of a n incident increases disproportionately. Theres really no ecidence to support this argument as far as I am aware. Please show me how transgender military members have a higher rate of suicide than the general pop of military members. >And that's an interesting spin: it's barring transgenders from the military that makes them suicidal, not the other way around. Got it. Yea, turns out discriminating against people at an institutional level increases their rates of suicide. I find it hard to believe youre surprised by this. Being socially ostracized is a huge risk factor for suicide and depression. >Now factor in the costs of ""sensitivity training"", reassignment surgeries, and the inevitable lawsuits and it's a recipe for disaster. It hasnt been an issue at all so far. Why would it start now? Youre using the same arguments people have used every time civil rights are increased, every time theyre wrong. Theyre wrong now."
