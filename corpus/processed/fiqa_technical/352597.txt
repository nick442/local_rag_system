Can't say I agree when we're talking about a minimum wage job. I sold a business this year and I'm fairly successful, but I did work some crap jobs in my younger days. For me personally, it was not at all worth the effort of going all out for $5.xx an hour (at the time) and I'm completely ok that I didn't. I tended to look at the few people who did put in their all with suspicion and I also think those people probably had low ceilings in life - way too satisfied with being worker bees.
