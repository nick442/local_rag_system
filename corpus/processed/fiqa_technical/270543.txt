Interest rates will be 0% and somehow the economy will magically pick up! That's seriously the plan. I think there will be class revolts as the status quo continues with continued fairly heavy inflation in food. The U.S. media will pretend it has something to do with people wanting freedom from tyranny or whatever. edit: My point is all economies are eventually doomed under the current system.
