"Do you know if you were approached by a carrier or a tower vendor? Edit/addendum: As someone in the telecommunications industry, I will say that you should NOT lease to a vendor who will sublease the space to the phone companies for a profit. Depending on the availability of space, the population of the area, and the value of the location, and the amount and size of hardware to be installed, the rental pricing can vary wildly. A cell site on a choice tall building in Chicago, NYC, Boston, LA, etc., can go for over $25000 per year (more in the case of rental of inside equipment room). On the other hand, renting space on a church steeple in the middle of a low population rural town, with the equipment installed in a gated paddock at ground level, may only net around $1500 per month. A ""small cell"" site, which is actually small enough to put on a lamp post or utility pole, can go for around $250-750 per month. A turf contractor/tower vendor actually leasing a chunk of land to build a structure whose space will be leased out to telecoms should be expected to pay between $2500 and 8000 per month depending on the value of your site. This value is determined by land form details like elevation, nearby tall forests (can the tower ""see"" over the tree line), terrain contours, and need (local population/tourist/traveler numbers). Carriers prefer to lease from vendors rather than building their own structures, but roof top sites are a different story. Carriers are generally more than happy to work with you to lease a portion of your tall building's roof. FYI.. If they offer to compensate you for the electrical requirements if they cannot get their own meter in, don't worry. A cell site uses less than 1000 watts, which translates to about $.10-15 per hour in most locations."
