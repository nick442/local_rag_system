Assuming this is a public company, i'd recommend reading the analyst calls from the last several quarters. This will give you an idea of what investors, and therefor likely the board and senior leadership, are focused on at a very high level. Youre an intern, so dont feel like you need to blow the doors off, but showing that you are aware of the company's major objectives and asking some thoughtful questions about them is probably a good start.
