In addition to the points this article makes, I believe that there are just many better burger options around these days. McDonalds will most likely always be on top of the cheap burger category because it's so ingrained into our culture. Around the northeast Ohio area we have a bunch of other burger options like Five Guys, Brown Bag, B-Spot, The Rail, etc. where for a few extra dollars you get a much more quality burger. I prefer Wendy's burgers over McD's, but Wendy's is in this middle ground in price between McD's (the value option) and a place like Five Guys (better quality).
