I dislike reading opinion articles because most people have a construed understanding of monetary policy and macroeconomics. I disagree completely about the Yuan possibly taking over as reserve currency. First of all, some countries use it as a reserve because they deal with china a lot and purchase a lot from china. when you purchase from china you either have to buy with Yuan or US dollar. we obviously print the dollar so we have no issue buying from them in dollar but many countries prefer to use the Yuan because they may have lower dollar reserves or its a higher transaction cost. Secondly, and probably the most important, is that China will be a failed economy/society most likely in the future. 1.5 billion people of many different ethnic groups. extreme inequality will lead to social unrest (already has). China has a lot of shit to take care of. It's quite laughable if anyone thinks the Yuan is a stable currency and can be a good reserve currency. I posted a link for you to read if you want to understand the monetary system and what the Fed's role is.
