Do you have an actual criticism of my argument to contribute to the discussion? Do you really consider yourself a reasonable person of science and evidence, when, confronted with evidence that people here are using pseudo-scientific, unsourced blogs to justify their claims, instead of refuting that, you derail the conversation into proving that the Earth isn't flat and whether Finland exists? You're just being facetious. You shouldn't abandon your integrity just because your arguing over the internet and see something you don't like.
