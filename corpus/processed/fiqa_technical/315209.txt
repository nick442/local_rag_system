>Are you saying they did commit fraud but it's hard too pin on any one person? You say there is little evidence there was fraud but that it's too hard to prove there was fraud. So what did they do if it wasn't fraud? I am saying both. I am saying that as a general matter criminal fraud is difficult to prove and expensive to litigate. Fraud requires intent. You have to know or reasonably know that what you are doing is fraudulent and you do it anyway. Proving that mens rea is extremely difficult in this situation. Risky does not mean fraudulent. The entire market was bundling mortgage backed securities. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (government backed entities) were the largest buyers of MBS. The point is that if the banks honestly believed that they MBS were secure and the regulators at the time did not see a problem with them - then how can you prove criminal fraud? We are only displaying hindsight bias because the subprime market did indeed implode and it did affect the wider mortgage market and the economy. But it wasn't known that would happen at the time. No financial models projected that everything would fail. You can blame lack of foresight or whatever, but risky losses is not criminal. Corporations are allowed the business judgment rule which is arguably the strongest presumption in all of law. There were bad models, but they weren't fraudulent. Now there could have been fraud in certain circumstances - but in no way was it systematic. It was bad modeling and bad economics. Again, [Bernanke has multiple quotes](http://www.businessinsider.com/bernanke-quotes-2010-12?op=1) saying there was no problem. How can the bank's actions be fraudulent when the top regulator is saying nothing is wrong and the market is working as intended?
