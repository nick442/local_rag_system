While you're right overall, in this particular case they were issuing the C&D for the use of Mcgregor's trademarks to sell merchandise. The website admitted to using his photos/likeness and his name. So at the very least they should have claim to all sales up to that point, and can try to get a piece of future sales claiming that the initial violations set it all in motion (would probably lose that). Disclaimer: Im not a lawyer, but I play one on the internet.
