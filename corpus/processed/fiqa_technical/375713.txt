Amazon is great for items with little manufacturing variances. For items with large manufacturing variances such as clothing, produces, etc, its logistic system doesnt work well. Yes, w/ a grocery chain acquisition it will solve a lot of the problem. No, Amazon Go store is still very conceptual and doesnt work for grocery shoppers behaviorally. It wont change even for kids once they start learning how to pick the right fruits, vaggies, etc. p.s., you could pick up shipment from Amazon Lockers which is pretty abundant around areas w/ a Whole Foods store.
