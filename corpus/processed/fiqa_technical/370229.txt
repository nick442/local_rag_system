"The trouble is that everybody is afraid of the consequences of letting ""too big to fail"" fail. I contend that it would be painful, but we would be better off in the long run if we let those with bad economic practices go out of business instead of rewarding them. Edit: It is like the difference between having a necessary needle shot quickly and sharply painful or having it slowing inserted and pulled out multiple times which is the equivalent of what we are going through now."
