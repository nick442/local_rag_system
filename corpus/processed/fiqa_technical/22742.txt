">Insurance: Uber/Lyft only insure their drivers while they are loaded. Meaning any other time they are driving around, even if they are driving to a call, they aren't insured. If they get in a wreck, their own car insurance won't cover it because they don't have taxi insurance which is a shit load more expensive than regular car insurance. That's not a taxi regulation, that's just a driving regulation: all vehicles must be insured. Are you saying that Uber/Lyft aren't even following the laws of the road? >Red-lining: Red-lining is where taxi companies will not server certain neighborhoods, meaning they will neither pick up nor drop off in the area. Taxi regulations actually allow red-lining by restricting service areas: ""sorry, I don't go to x town - I'm only licensed for y town."" Even with the regulations, taxis do it anyway. That's why they ask for your destination before they give you an ETA on pickup >Discrimination: All classes are protected under taxi regulations with serious repercussions for discrimination. This also includes people with disabilities, like the blind and those in wheel chairs. That's just a part of the general law: industry regulations are redundant there. >Rates: Taxi rates are typically approved by the city so that companies can't ~~constantly change them~~ compete with each other and drive the prices down Rate-setting isn't a good thing. >They need to obey the same laws that taxi companies are Yep. The taxi regulations should largely be repealed: they've outlived their usefulness"
