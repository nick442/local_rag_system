I don't like to use the word racist because, as you have pointed out, it is has been weaponized in discourse. It would have been better for me to write about racISM rather than actually use the word racIST in my last post. I try to keep my posts about ideas and not people and I messed up. I have no basis to call YOU a racist, I don't know you. Nor will I assume any malice on your part or on the part of those who disagree with me. All I am stating is that there appears to be no reason to think that races are [biologically important and distinct](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/race-is-a-social-construct-scientists-argue/). I bring up zodiac as an example because, if you go looking, you may find that some groups statistically share traits. But it doesn't mean anything because correlation doesn't prove causation. I also use this analogy because zodiac is seen as something of a benign belief, and that's all I want to get across here, that people often adopt the beliefs of their society. Like the widespread belief in god, I find the widespread belief in race to be misplaced.
