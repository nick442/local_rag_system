"None of these plans work on a national scale. Taking care of the sick is great, but let's not pretend that making me pay for other people's healthcare is going to save me money. Since most people are of a average health, and the sickest are exponentially more expensive to care for.. A system where ""everyone is in"" must necessarily cost more for the average person.. because they are the people paying to take care of the sickest. The only people who save are the sickest in the country. This is all about who pays, not how much is paid. If we want to fix health care costs, it will be by regulating health care. Regulating health insurance makes sure that the health care providers get paid - which only causes them to charge more (knowing they'll get paid). We should focus on making a marketplace for care - not insurace. Require prices be posted. Treatment success statistics. Stop requiring prescriptions for basic stuff like birth control.. Eliminate other protectionisms like prescriptions for contacts and dinstance glasses (Rx needed for nearsightedness but not for farsightedness.. Because most are nearsighted and that generates the business.. Gets folks into opticians and then increases the cost of glasses.) IDK exactly what, but at least try to foster competition on price in the provider side."
