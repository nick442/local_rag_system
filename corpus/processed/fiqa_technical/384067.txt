"Windows RT in general was a huge fuckup. ""Let's remake Windows Mobile so that it doesn't run any previously existing software, then make WIndows 8 resemble that single-tasking, touchscreen-centric design for no goddamn reason, and *then* bring resurrect Windows CE's bony corpse as the unholy midpoint of those two terrible decisions."" Intel Atom smartphones came out like a month after the Surface. Why the fuck aren't Windows Phones running actual Windows with a simplified userland and the specs of an eight-year-old laptop? If the Surface Pro makes sense without a keyboard, then why the hell wouldn't I want my smartphone to leverage the hundreds of applications I already know and trust? Microsoft's rushing to embrace and exploit Apple's walled garden, but they could destroy it completely if my next smartphone could just play movies and view PDFs without having to pay money or look at ads."
