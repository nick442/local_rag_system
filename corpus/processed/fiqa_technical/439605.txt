The investments he's chosen are well diversified. You can argue the details, but it's a low-fee, low-risk plan that's simple to implement, which makes it better than what 95%+ of people do. Starting saving early is also a great idea. Now for the bad news. $1mm is not enough to retire on. It can't generate $80k / year without significant risk, and even if it could, those investment gains would be taxable. The general rule of thumb is that you should have 25x your annual expenses saved when you retire, a bit more if you want to retire early at 50. Don't forget that inflation means $1mm in 24 years will not have the same purchasing power it does today.
