I never said I didn't want them to crumble, just acknowledging the fact it will at some point. The input customers and flight companies have doesn't weigh as much as you think on the decisions TSA makes. It's like saying oh yeah the D.O.D. conferred with citizens about NDAA so instead of beating them while we hold them indefinitely we'll just tickle them till they pee themselves stupid. There isn't that much transparency in most of what goes on, so don't be sold on press releases alone.
