The music industry put up a fight, but look where we are now. I can spend $8 a month to get almost any song I want to listen to at any time from Spotify and even download it for offline use on my mobile devices. I can buy songs from iTunes without any DRM and upload them to Amazon Cloud to download later on to a Zune. I can't wait until television and movies are the same way.
