I'm going to echo everyone else's sentiments in this thread. What a ridiculous article! You have a solid, dependable, money making star that runs her own show like a well oiled machine and your biggest critique is that she is a sound business woman? I think there is a special place in journalist hell for writers who try to get attention by only playing contrarian for the sake of being contrarian. News flash, pretty unoriginal. I'm not really a fan of her music but man do I love to see sound business people doing it right. This is worth commending.
