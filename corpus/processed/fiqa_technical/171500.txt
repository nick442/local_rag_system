Well I'd consider Citadel Securities a prop shop and all the others besides for bridgewater prop shops as well. And I do work FO,thanks for the appreciation, but was hired there after 3 years of trading experience. I guess it depends on what you are comparing the loads of kids hired to because I really can't think of many professions, especially in finance, that have less kids hired straight out of undergrad. And Evercore and Laz are making over 100k but bottom bucket at JPM and GS did not make all in salary over 100k this year.
