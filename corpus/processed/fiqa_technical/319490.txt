In the San Francisco bay area I know the region is putting to use Clipper cards. If you load them with clipper cash that money sticks around until you ultimately use it. The card itself maxes out at like $300 but any excess funneling into the card is kept with Clipper and shows up in your account as like some itemized deposit pending to distribute to your card once the card's balance drops below the limit to the amount that is pending deposit. If you however use the money for something like a month pass which is only good for that month and you don't use the pass to break even then you lose that money.
