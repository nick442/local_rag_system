"There was a time when government policy was actually pretty damn smart. There were a range of ""automatic stabilizers"" that kicked in when there was a recession and they had a fast and large impact. It wasn't until Reagan that we started to chip away at those as well as go into a perpetual debt stimulus posture. These two actions helped to prime the system for an inevitable ""large"" shock. Even now, after one of the longest expansions in history we're STILL running a substantial deficit. And as such the appetite to expand it when the next recession hits will be diminished (as it was during the great recession when we really needed 3 trillion in stimulus spending and got less than 1)."
