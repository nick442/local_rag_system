"How is paying a liveable wage ""overpaying"" them? These stores make money hand over fist, and would not be able to do any of that without the help of everyone on the front lines working their ass off. Working an extra 10-20 hours of unpaid overtime for fear of being fired if they don't. I've got my nice cushy corporate job now, but I have worked at one of these shit holes (target, not walmart) and it is horrifying how they treat their employees."
