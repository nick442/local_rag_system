"Yet another ""If X, then EUROFAIL!!"" It's really fucking tedious even without the screamingly, mind-numbingly wrong ""logic"" of this one. If you're lending money to Germany at 0% and still expect to make a profit, it's because the Euro *will be HIGHER* than your currency at the end of the loan period. This one doesn't look like stupidity so much as a really ham-fisted manipulation attempt to engineer a short-term euro drop for a nicer buy-in."
