"Another factor you may want to consider is insurance, if your wife is at their house as a friend who happens to be teaching the kid to play and the kid falls off their chair and hurts them self that is rather different to your wife being brought in to the house as a contractor and an injury occurring during an activity that she was supervising. I am in a similar situation and I have a $5 million public liability policy, which costs about $300 per year. So if her income is likely to be less than that she may be better off ""helping a friend learn"" rather than ""providing tutoring services"". There may also be legal requirements, I am required to apply for government checks every few years in order to operate a business that involves working with children."
