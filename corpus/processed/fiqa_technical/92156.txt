I do appreciate the explanation. I was being a bit facetious about hotdogs in that I don't buy the SAME hotdog over and over again. But seriously, I still don't see why rising house prices shouldn't count towards inflation. 100s of thousands of homes are bought per day affecting millions of consumers per day. The price fluctuations in housing absolutely affect the spending habits of consumers in every other facet of the economy. Or put another way, what if in some wacky world everyone stopped buying virtually all other items except bare essentials because they were all focused on buying homes. A huge construction industry boom ensues. Millions are working building homes. Home prices skyrocket 1000% and become like 80% of GDP. Is inflation dead? Or has it just shifted to another asset under our typical inflation radar? Living costs are still very much affected by housing in this scenario. They're just affected by millions of separate people at once each day. To say that because one person doesn't repeat buy housing too often, means policy regarding inflation should be ignorant of housing prices, just isn't right. That they are bought and sold by millions of consumers each month is just as important to the economy as food, energy, or any other major facet of our economy. In any event, inflation might be lagging, but it sure as hell isn't lagging when it comes to housing.
