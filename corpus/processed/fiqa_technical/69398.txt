The shopping cart is probably the worst bit, although the cutting was obviously sloppy. I find that Vice produces good content sometimes, but their website is horrendous. There's frequently writing overlaying images with colors that blend or clash. At first, I thought that my extensions were breaking the design, but after whitelisting it every way possible I have come to the conclusion that whoever designed it for them was not a professional. It's simply bad.
