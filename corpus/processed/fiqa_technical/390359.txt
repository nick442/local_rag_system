"I invested in Prosper.com loans. I'm getting out. I only have about $37 left, and as the principal is doled back to me, I withdraw the money. The default rate I experienced was over 30%. Only six of the 53 loans I invested in were with borrowers whose credit rating was less than ""A."" Borrowers with a rating of ""A"" and ""AA"" had a higher proportion of defaults that those below ""A"". Some of my blogging colleagues were wise enough not to start this game. Some who invest in other P2P lending are almost certainly doing it with ""found money."" They post articles with affiliate links. As people sign up, they get the commissions deposited in their accounts, which they invest. As they update their blogs with the returns on their portfolio, it serves to encourage more signups, and the machine continues on. Even if they lose money on the invested loans, they're still ahead. To paraphrase John Chow's tagline: They make money with Lending Club by telling people how much money they're making with Lending Club. It's almost like investing with the house's money. My high default rate might be because I started earlier in the game. Borrower screening and criteria have gotten tighter with time. I don't recommend investing in P2P loans. My experience has been that a large percentage of borrowers requesting loans on these sites have run out of options, which the credit reporting doesn't reflect accurately enough."
