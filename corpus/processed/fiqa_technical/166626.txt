"Very different statement. ""There's an asset bubble/opacity in Chinese real estate and equities"" is a BIT different from ""I never trust anything coming out of China. They're all smoke and mirrors."" China has, in fact, had rapid economic growth for decades. The fact that you are a student makes me suspect you've been taught laissez-faire ideology rather than a more historically-grounded economic analysis that includes the role of things like infrastructure projects in economic growth (the primary driver of China's boom)."
