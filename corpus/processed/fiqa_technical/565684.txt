The Mad Fientist has an article on this. He gives these following benefits: He also gives the caveat that your employer may not match things in their entirety. Like you mentioned, this mostly applies to 401(k)s and not to HSAs where the employer tends to contribute a fixed amount (in my experience).

In the comment section of the linked article, several big-name early retirees confess to front-loading before it was cool.
