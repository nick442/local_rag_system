It may also be that as the employment numbers don't count people who have left the workforce, full employment isn't really, because people are getting jobs who have been in the large group of uncounted 'not in workforce' people, so there is no upward pressure on wages - exactly as it would be if actual unemployment was much higher than the government claims.
