Unless you spend a lot of money on the TD Gold Elite Visa, and are interested in the Deluxe TD Auto Club, the $99 annual fee is probably not worth it. Instead, the Citi Enrich MasterCard provides the same 1% cash back on all purchases without an annual fee. There's also an unadvertised Platinum version of the card, which includes other perks like car rental insurance, etc. From what I calculated a while back, The PC Financial MasterCard PC Points system works out to a 1% return as well. Unless there are extra deals like 5x point sales that I'm not aware of, cold hard cash would be a better option. Also check out the RFD Credit Card Head to Head article for way more options.
