U.S. companies have two fundamental problems not within their control (plus others of course) 1. Growth in China is slowing dramatically, cutting prices and demand for commodities we export. Even companies like Yum (which owns KFC) are hurting) 2. European demand for finished and high tech products is down sharply. So while American demand is trying to make a comeback, we are so inter-linked that American businesses cannot fix this by themselves. If I were buying stock, I'd look at companies that produce and sell entirely in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Edit: And I'd stay the heck away from new investment in the BRICS Edit2: And its fine (from an investment POV ) if companies source parts or material outside of the U.S./Canada/Mexico - just don't count on any sales strength to China or Europe or the BRICS.
