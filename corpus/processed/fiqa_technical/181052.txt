"On broad strokes, the market does ""work properly."" I invest in bio and spend a lot of time in front of trial research, reports, pipeline procedure, and various catalysts. I can tell you that you have absolutely no idea how much damage would be done if the FDA was not involved in the pipeline. None. Your attitude is naive at best but is obviously more likely the result of an exhausted political viewpoint. I'm tired of this ""magic hand"" garbage. It never worked. It doesn't work. It will not work. It won't work. Got it? Do you understand this?"
