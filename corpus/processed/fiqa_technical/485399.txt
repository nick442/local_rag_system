You can't tell much by comparing TV's in the store. There are so many variables that aren't controlled for. There's no way to know if all the TV's on display are properly set up and perfectly calibrated. Having said that, from your average viewing distance I think most people won't even be able to see much of a difference between most TV's, except maybe if you're comparing the best of the best with the worst of the worst.
