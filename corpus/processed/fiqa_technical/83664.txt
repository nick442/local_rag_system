I worked at the Olive Garden in both New York and California. Corporate Olive Garden is super cheap. Staff doesn't even get a free meal when working all day (you have to pay for your food). Managers got paid bonuses if they sold more deserts/alcohol so waiters are forced to offer every customer wine samples and pitch them on other drinks. One thing I learned is that if you complain at one of the Darden Restaurants you are almost guaranteed to get comped. The restaurants rely heavily on good feedback to keep corporate happy. So eat all your food and then complain that it was gross and cold and they will give you free desert, or take the check if you push hard enough.
