"Pay off your debt. As you witnessed, no ""investment"" % is guaranteed. But your debt payments are.. so if you have cash, the best way to ""invest"" it is to pay off your debt. Since your car is depreciating while your house may be appreciating (don't know but it's possible) you should pay off your car loan first. You're losing money in more than one way on that investment."
