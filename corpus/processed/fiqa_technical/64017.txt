"http://www.attaincapital.com/alternative-investment-education/managed-futures-newsletter/investment-research-analysis/423 http://www.cta-info.com/cta_stats.htm I just googled ""managed futures stats"". I'm not 100% sure what your goal is, but I wouldn't look to filter out trades. You're better off grading returns and variance within the returns. http://www.autumngold.com/ Poke around the ""top traders"" section and compare the returns with the drawdown of the traders. You'll see the ""lucky"" traders, but you'll also see the high risk guys and low risk guys."
