Note that the pros pay for extremely fast access and are literally fighting over nanoseconds to get every possible advantage. Your system won't come close to that by several orders of magnitude. Consider the implications for the kinds of automated trading you want to perform. (Pico was overstating it. Nano, at the processor level and in terms of which transaction is first into the buffers, is certainly true. A millisecond is a Long Time in this domain.)
