It's not for the purposes of ""hiding,"" but more for administration purposes. For example, JP Morgan Nominees will have a direct account that does all the trading *on behalf* of clients. Clients then have a subaccount *within* the nominee account. It just makes it easier for everyone to trade on *one* account overall and then allocate it appropriately after the fact. > Do all banks have some kind of wealth management/funds management business? A LOT of them do."
