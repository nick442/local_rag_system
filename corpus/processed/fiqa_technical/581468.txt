I understand that Baby Boomer retirement is a factor, but when you stated 'there are more jobs than ever', it doesn't really support the idea that we don't have an unemployment crisis looming. In other words, the fact that there are more payroll positions doesn't play into the effectiveness of the US's employment strategy (if it even has one). After all, it's trivial to show that the number of part-time positions is booming while full-time positions are contracting. Surely you don't think that every part-time job has the same economic benefit as a full-time job? Even without a burger-making robot, we have a problem with enough work being available for our populace. If/when food prep automatons hit the big time, we're going to collectively flush out the part-timers that are the only section of the workforce that actually has been increasing in positions. What then? I keep hearing people make comparisons to previous manufacturing or technological revolutions/evolutions, like buggy whips going away as automobiles came online. But those comparisons are fundamentally flawed as they didn't involve REPLACING the human, they involved augmenting humans with better and better tech. We still needed the human. Now we face a major evolutionary hump, where we are replacing the humans hands and BRAINS with machinery. We simply don't need the human any more, they just get in the way. It's a fundamentally different proposition than we have faced before.
