"The money you invested in your Roth was taxed as income when you filed your income tax. A Roth contribution is ""post-tax"" as opposed to a standard IRA or 401k contribution which are ""pre-tax"". Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income for the year. In example, you had income of $100,000 and made a standard IRA contribution of $5000. Your taxable income would be $95,000. In the case of a Roth contribution, the same $5000 investment would not reduce your taxable income for the year."
