"Taxing wealth is an easy idea, but I don't think it can ever work. Wealth is too easily hidden, transformed, or revalued. Taxing actual cash flows works because two parties have to declare it. Taxing wealth would cause huge conflicts as to how wealth is measured. That said, I'm a big fan of the idea that the estate tax should be massively increased, and would only involve a single evaluation per taxpayer, rather than every year. Taxing more measurable forms of wealth, like stocks, would cause wealth to flow from stocks into property, which would then be valued as low as possible, causing a general market crash and another great depression. I'm most curious about a Georgian tax scheme, which is where taxes are levied on un-improved property. Per wikipedia: ""Georgism, based on the belief that people should own the value they produce themselves, but that the economic value derived from land (including natural resources) should belong equally to all members of society."" So most taxes in society would be generated by those who owned property as a speculation and didn't invest in it. Incentives would be to make all property held privately be as economically productive as possible."
