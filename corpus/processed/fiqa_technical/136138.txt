This isn't super specific to your question, but I'd recommend that you invest a ton of time in practice questions (then review the answers to the ones you got wrong). This is a good strategy for most exams, but it's particularly true for the Series 7, as the S7 is notorious for using questions on the actual exam that are almost identical to practice questions. I was amazed at how many questions I recognized almost word-for-word when I took it. I recently took my CFP test, so I'm pretty brushed-up on testing concepts and that sort of thing right now. If you are running into anything in particular, feel free to PM me!
