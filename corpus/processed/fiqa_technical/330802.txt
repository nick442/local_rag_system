The PriceCheck app is capable of doing the search by taking a picture of the product or speaking the product name, which isn't an option on the Amazon App as far as I'm aware. But it's funny that you mention that they are the same app, because amazon also has a Amazon Student app which does the **EXACT** same thing as the regular app. I just use it because it has a better interface IMO.
