I have been a long time supporter of this viewpoint, but price drops of solar and battery over the last few years are starting to make it look like nothing will be able to beat the economics of solar. Nuclear is quite expensive and has a long payoff period and I don't think people will choose it over solar and wind much any more. Though I do think we need to update our existing reactors to new technology to solve some of the waste issues if this is possible (though I'm not sure it is)
