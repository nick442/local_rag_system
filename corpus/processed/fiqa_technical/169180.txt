I like that Ballmer bought the Clippers. He's a real step up from Sterling. I grew up in LA and always hated the guy, mostly because he took out full-page ads in the *L.A. Times* to tell everyone how wonderful he is. Sterling is an enormous douche, the racism is only a small part of how awful he is.
