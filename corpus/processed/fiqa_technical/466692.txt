"A ""bad customer"" isn't someone who needs a lot of support due to a situation like Bob's. ""Bad customer"" is someone who generates work. You get nothing but complaints, everything is about how fucked up your software is, etc, etc, etc. It might also be a customer who's trying to use your product wrong. There are also customers that really are resource pits. Note that after that one call, they never heard from Bob again. In fact, a customer that calls for two hours a month would use more than Bob did over the course of the year. So if Bob called back the next day to ask about setting up a printer, and the next day to set up internet connectivity, and the day after that for help with the Windows setup thing again, and the next day for more printer help.. then you start to get into evaluating the value of the customer. There's some judgement involved here - the CEO felt that if he got Bob up and running, then Bob would be good to go (and he was right)."
