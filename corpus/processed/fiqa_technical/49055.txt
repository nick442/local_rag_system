"I believe transparency when it comes to our food is important. So far the laws have always favored the industry, going so far as to suspend first amendment rights when it comes to ""Disparaging food products."" The profits of large agricultural companies shouldn't silence all dissent, reporting and discussion. They should absolutely have the right to use and sell pink slime, and we deserve the right to know that the're hiding it in our food."
