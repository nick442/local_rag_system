"I believe that is the purpose of write-offs aka ""loopholes"", to save people money on their taxes. The tax code is an incentive system, right now there are huge incentives for corporations to organize themselves in odd ways to avoid taxes. If we restructure the tax code, the behavior will change. No sense in blaming companies for playing by the rules."
