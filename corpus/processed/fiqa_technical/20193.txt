As somebody who has worked remotely for the last 5 years, first at 50%, then at 100%, I find this shift to be far superior to office work. My productivity is up, my focus is good, and the work/life balance is far better than if I was working in an office. I can put in a longer day than my colleagues, yet still be free to pursue outside goals sooner than they are by eliminating my commute. Instead of spending money on greasy rushed lunches near the office, I eat healthy and cheaply at home. My energy, focus, and balance are all better.
