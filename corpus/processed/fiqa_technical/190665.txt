Cutting taxes to raise tax revenue is a fantasy that has never come true. Reagan tried it and the [deficit skyrocketed](http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/five-myths-about-ronald-reagans-legacy/2011/02/04/ABs1qxQ_story.html), so he reversed it: >Certainly, Reagan's boldest move as president was his 1981 tax cut, a sweeping measure that slashed the marginal rate on the wealthiest Americans from 70 percent to 50 percent. The legislation also included smaller cuts in lower tax brackets, as well as big breaks for corporations and the oil industry. But the following year, as the economy was mired in recession and the federal deficit was spiraling out of control, even groups such as the Business Roundtable lobbied Reagan to raise taxes. And he did: The Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 was, at the time, the largest peacetime tax increase in U.S. history. Bush had two massive tax cuts, and deficits rocketed again. Cutting taxes doesn't bring more tax revenue in. Why not cut taxes to zero on the promise of infinite revenue?
