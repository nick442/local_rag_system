Being curious is fine, but ascribing any special import to a GM ingredient, as opposed to the product of hybridization, or artificial selection, is silly. That specific question is not actually meaningful in any way whatsoever. And once again, I fully support the right of people to have answers to their asinine questions. Calling it asinine doesn't work against the goal of transparency.
