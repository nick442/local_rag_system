"I buy a lot of lumber in Japan. I grew up in the US, so I used feet and inches and Home Depot lumber for a long time. It is not illegal, it is just fucking stupid that we will buy wood when we are unsure of the dimensions, and Home Depot doesn't label what it *actually* is. I really really like system here in Japan. They have a mix of traditional, metric, and imperial size lumber, but it is easy to use it all. The key is that everything is converted to millimeters and displayed on the signage in-store. The other key point is that the wood actually matches that mm dimension. A pack of 30x40x3995mm wood is exactly those dimensions. They have a lot of 2x4 lumber with imperial labels, (feet marked in ""f""), but it is also marked in millimeters - so a standard 2x4 6f plank is 41x92x1820mm. There is no question as to the exact dimensions of the boards. I buy metric 90x90mm lumber, which is roughly the size of a 4x4 (92x92mm), and 6å°º roofing panels (1 *shaku* is 303mm and is very close to 1 foot), so since everything is reduced to millimeters, it is easy to buy and cut the lumber to exact dimensions without worrying about how they will actually fit together - something that is a horrible pain in the ass with US lumber."
