I expect it goes back long before Eisenhower. I expect it goes back long before Washington. I expect it goes back long before Julius Caesar. That shouldn't mean I can express my disgust at it. I'm weary of politics, and a company that wants my money doesn't need to pander to any ideology they think I hold. More specific to this particular story, I don't particularly care how my employees vote. I pay them for the value they bring to our company; what they do with THEIR money is up to them.
