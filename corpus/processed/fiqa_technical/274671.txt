"HR people are the clueless, and you are the typical example: not trying to counter my points, resort to personal attacks, clueless about human skills, job requirements, human relations, etc. **It's not debatable! As an IT professional, with 100% certainty, when I just heard the idiotic things Susan said in a recent interview, I knew immediately she's a clueless idiot.** Do you doubt my assertion? Listen! When hearing the story of Susan, the great Chief Information Security Officer at Equifax, responsible for the biggest personal data breach in the world, at least 95% know that with at least 98% certainty she got her jobs because she knows someone or someone knows her, and she has no skills or talent. Here's, again, what the genius Susan said: ""*Susan: â€œThere are a lot of things to consider with that. One school of thought says that when you put corporate assets into the cloud, they are more secure because you know exactly what you have there. You have an exact inventory, you know exactly who has access to that data, and how it is controlled.*"" **This is so totally dumb, incorrect and only an clueless idiot will say such a thing.**"
