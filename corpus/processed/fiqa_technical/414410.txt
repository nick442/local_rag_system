even in today's society, there are many who want to work, but cannot. as automation continues, this trend will grow. the reason we need universal basic income is to protect those not in the inner circles of workers. It will let the economy continue to sell them food, shelter, ect. the most recent professional estimate I read showed full automation was 125 years away. that means 125 years until no employment whatsoever. it may be some decades until we have to seriously look at this, but it is on the horizon. we, as a society, are transitioning away from the industrial model where we needed everyone to work.
