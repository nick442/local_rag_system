Some people in the corporation set up a system that some other employees gamed, right? That's not exactly a middle finger to the country, that's an incentive system gone horrible wrong for the bank themselves. And for any consumers who were hit with fees from this, but from the class action settlement email I just got it looks like impacted consumers will be getting their money back and more. That seems to be the gist of this scandal. It's a worrisome comment on WFC internal controls, but if you are worried about internal controls then the bank that just had a scandal is likely to have over-corrected for this issue relative to other options.
