"Edited answer, given that I didn't address the emergency fund aspect originally: None. You've said you don't feel comfortable locking it away where you wouldn't be able to get to it in an emergency. If you don't like locking it away, the answer to ""How much money should I lock up in my savings account?"" is none. On a more personal note, the interest rates on bonds are just awful. Over five years, you can do better."
