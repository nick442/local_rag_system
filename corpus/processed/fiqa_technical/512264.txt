I didn't know what I was doing. The cryptocurrency NEO was being hyped up on a message board so I just impuslively threw 1k into it. I got luck. Now I have 15k in OMG coin. Apparently we are going to see 10x gains. At the end of the day investing isn't relaible enough to replace a solid income so unless I make 7 figures, so I'm not going to be leaving my parent's basement anytime soon. But I guess you're right about 24 year olds not buying houses these days. I just felt really insecure because this girl made 10 times as much as me. I'm a cockroach compared to her.
