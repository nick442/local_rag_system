This is dumb on many levels. First are they really trying to blame the Flash Crash for investors leaving the market. It's 2014 and they claim in 17 of 25 months since the 2010 crash investors have withdrawn (not really sure what this means either, since shares don't disappear- does this just mean the market is up? It's unclear). Either way the article quoted is from 2012! And for a research team creating an empirical model, this is a very scary usage of small sample size, mistaking correlation for causation, etc. And the algo, though they don't give much info, seems to be the very essence of data mining. Pick a million signals and filter on those that are empirically the best. If you are an individual investor or a small fund thinking of purchasing something like this, first consider: if it really worked, why are the founders selling it when they could just use it themselves and profit from it? It's almost guaranteed not to work out of sample
