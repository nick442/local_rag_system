"This is a very uninformed statement. Becoming an executive of a large corporation under the age of 30 (or even 35) is extremely unheard of. It's an unbelievable accomplishment. It's very likely that having an affluent family (is this even confirmed?) helped this guy a TON when he was a kid: he got a good education and was able to get into Princeton. After that, though, this guy was on his own. Getting a job at Goldman, doing well enough in it to get a PE job, doing well enough at that to get additional PE jobs and eventually becoming a partner, and doing well enough at that to becoming a fucking CFO at 29.. you don't do that because of ""connections"". You do that because you balled out at your job, you worked ridiculous hours, you outperformed your coworkers for promotions, etc; which this guy certainly did. There are a lot of affluent people that get into great colleges like Princeton, disproportionately so. But there are lots of ""regular folks"" that get into those schools too, and once they get there they have the same opportunity to excel in their careers. Comments to the contrary are woefully uninformed."
