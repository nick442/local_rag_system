I don't think they have expressed their ideas [as clearly as I did](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_absurdum), no. I managed, in a sentence, to make two points: 1) if people who make money in the stock market don't like when that gain is taxed, then logically someone who likes when that gain is taxed does not make money in the stock market, and 2) it is ridiculous for Bob to think he is entitled to 5 cows if John sells Jim ten thousand heads.
