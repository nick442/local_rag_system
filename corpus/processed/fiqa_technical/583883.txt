"And if you subtract that 30% (the 19% Social Security and 11% Fed holdings) which are entirely bogus and moot.. Then that 32% (out of the remaining 70%) is pretty darned near half, and regardless of it being just shy of a majority, it is still the largest block. Even then, since the dollar itself is backed by nothing, it isn't technically a problem -- the US can pay it off at any time (the only inherent cost being the debasement of the currency). Where the problem with that comes in is that there are a LOT of US assets located on foreign soil (all of the ""joint-operation"" manufacturing plants in China, for instance); and foreign governments CAN hold them ""hostage"" (so to speak), or if they so choose, to literally confiscate (nationalize) them and yet legally ""compensate"" their US based paper-owners by paying them off with the debased dollars (and/or US treas bonds, same thing really).. basically just ""paying"" us with checks drawn on our own collective account."
