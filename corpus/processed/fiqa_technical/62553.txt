"Wrong again, bucko. I don't believe in any gods floating around in the heavens watching our little ant farm here. It's fucking laughable. I can't believe ANYONE believes that bullshit anymore. But I respect people's right to believe in Jesus, Allah, Buddha, or the Easter Bunny, as long as they don't go around killing people in the name of their god, like muslims do. And as I stated before, islam has been misclassified. Islam is no religion, it is actually an organized terror group, wanting to dominate the entire world, and anyone not believing in their terrorist group or their god, is an infidel, and is the enemy, and must be destroyed, per their own ""handbook"", the Koran. You have the worst argument in the history of mankind. Don't run away just because your position is indefensible and retarded. Stand and face the music. Your mind might expand. Repent your retardation, son. I will forgive you! I can be your new fucking god."
