American living in Canada, actually. Seeing the system in action here, while imperfect, is much better than what the US is doing. By design, it's class warfare, rather than making your government fix it, you wind up angry at your employer, IE some big corporate entity and/or their insurers. Strange thing is, dollar for dollar, the American government pays more per citizen for health care than their Canadian counterparts. Actually, just about [everyone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_the_health_care_systems_in_Canada_and_the_United_States).. And so completely fucked..
