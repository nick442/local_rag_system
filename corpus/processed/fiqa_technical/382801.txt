"Not to be rude, but I think you have an extremely naive view of how the United States operates. Insurance and Health Care are the exact same thing in this country for 99.9% of the people in it. The reason for this is that there is no way that anyone can afford ""healthcare"" without an insurance company unless they are in the top .1%. That is the way the system was set up, and it results in millions being uninsured and millions more being uninsurable. I am not an ignorant person, but clearly it makes you feel superior to say it, so carry on. You have no idea what you are talking about, or whom you are talking to."
