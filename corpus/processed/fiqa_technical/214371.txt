Give it time. Soon, other countries won't be able to have flights to the US unless people are pre-screened by the TSA agents in the departing country just past customs. Considering all the other expansions the TSA is doing, I have no doubt they'll try. And I have no doubt more than a few countries will go along. It wouldn't surprise me if the TSA screened people from the other countries after they got off the plane. You know, so they can figure out if you *were* going to blow up the plane.
