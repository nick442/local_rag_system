What I find hilarious about this is that the middle class thought they actually had that value in the first place. Looks like the hood has been pulled off and they now realize 'oh wait you mean Im actually very poor'. Yes, your house was not worth that much. In fact its value may still be inflated. This goes doubly true for the over extended and failing suburban sprawl 'experiment' that began in the 70s. Its all been stolen b/c a generation wasnt taught about how money actually works. Its sad but maybe now people will pay attention to politics and economics and do something about our disastrous policies.
