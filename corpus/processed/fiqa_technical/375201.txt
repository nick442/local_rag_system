"As someone who works in tech and has seen a thing or two, the fallacy of moving to college towns to foster innovation is a farce. The whole reason businesses do this is to get an endless supply of cheap labor from new graduates who don't have families, thus will work nights and weekends for free to make a name for themselves. Once those kids wise up and maybe want to start a family, they move to suburbs away from these college towns and leave those companies which leads to high attrition rates for mid level employees. This also leads to inferior products from a ""high technology"" standpoint because of lack of senior mentors and you end up with shit projects just slapped together that just barely work. Would you want your GE jet engines designed on the cheap by recent graduates or disciplined engineers? I'm not saying it's a bad business decision, it is totally valid and smart for some markets, but it seems like GE has their hands in important technology that shouldn't be designed like this. If they want to reinvent themselves why not make a Boston technology center for innovation, not move their whole business? It just didn't make sense."
