"I agree to some degree, but I've gotten very jaded over the past 25 years. You could have the best boss in the world, be working on a fantastic project, have a solid career path, and they'll still throw you out like yesterday's trash if anyone says ""recession"" So my philosophy is more tactical (month to month) than strategic (build a career). And it's rooted in this: >I believe in a fair days pay for a fair days work Except that I've come to believe in a fair hour's pay for a fair hour's work, because on salary it seems that a ""fair day's work"" is never less than eight hours but frequently more. Put in twelve hours on a project in crunch time? Here's your standard eight hours pay. Work Saturday on something that saves the company fifteen million dollars? Here are two vouchers for dinner at the Outback Steakhouse and we'll see you Monday morning."
