Chicken that's been processed to include other ingredients. For example, we could buy a chicken product, that is partially chicken, and partially not, and use that to make our meatballs. We don't though, so it's made with 100% chicken. I get how the end result is similar, but it's a separation of processors. Our meatballs include bread crumbs, cream, onions, etc., and are hence not 100% chicken, but our input is chicken (and our product 97.6% chicken).
