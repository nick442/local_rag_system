We also have for-profit, career-oriented schools which take advantage of students and get them to pay for training that used to be done on the job. The training is often sub par and the only students who do well are those who would have been able to teach themselves the skills at a fraction of the cost. The influx of minimally qualified applicants then drives down wages in that field while removing the possibility for promotion for anyone who wanted to train on the job.
