Haha, aside from the fact that consensually choosing which career path you would like to go down is not at all akin to slavery and severely diminishes what actual slaves went (and in some places still go) through, even if your premise was right, your supposition is still wrong. People on the corner begging for money make a pretty decent amount of money with no employer. Certainly more than I make.
