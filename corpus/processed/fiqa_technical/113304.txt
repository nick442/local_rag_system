> Are you suggesting when they break a law involving a small portion of their total business they pay fines involving all portions of their business? Im suggesting if they break the law they go to jail, just like every one else. Im pretty sure what they did is worst than smoking a doobie and yet no one has gone to jail. just some light fines.
