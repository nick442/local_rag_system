Wait. hold on, is this good news or bad news? I didnt see any information if these were good jobs? We all know some jobs a total shit, so did we add 209,000 shit jobs? Do these jobs pay a liveable wage, whats the quality of life these jobs will create? Will these jobs provide health care or require any government assistance? Will these jobs create greater social service dependencies because that wouldnt be anything to celebrate. At face value, these jobs could actually increase everyones taxes due to the fact the government supports low wage earners via food stamps, health care, etc. I believe this headline would hold a lot more weight if we had a better understanding of the facts.
