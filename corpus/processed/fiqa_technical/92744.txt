There will still be jobs that require a human, we don't have the technology to develop or build anything close to the human brain and body. >or will there be some lag time? I think there will be some lag time which would be painful. I think technology changes way faster than a labor force can change skills. It's why I believe that we need to continue to make investments into education, help make it more affordable and reform the education system so people can explore their potential/creativity/go at their own pace rather than teaching to the test and herding everyone along. I believe I greatly benefited by being placed into a education program that allowed students to explore their potential. A teacher I had in elementary school thought I would be a good candidate for the program and I tested into it. The State of Oregon operates a [TAG](http://www.ode.state.or.us/search/page/?id=2321) (Talented and Gifted) program and this program helped a lot.
