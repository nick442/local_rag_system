You misunderstand my intentions. The financial markets dipped pretty badly after 08 happened - primarily because of the crisis. But they stayed down because of the following deregulation.. Mandated they kept more cash on reserve to prevent bailouts (Dodd frank), and increased spending on compliance - overall decreasing their profit margins. They're still at historical lows. Now if those regulations were rolled back, their profit margins would increase (minus any external setbacks). That's why I think it would be calculated to strive for their historical averages pre-08 if the industry returns to the historical climate. Sure it's a bet, but I would argue it's a logical one
