> One is whether prices are correlated to each other for long periods of time as a preliminary study suggested (which would go against efficient markets hypothesis, since you could use that info to game the market) or if that result is illusory and the long term returns are close to a standard normal distribution which would follow the effiecient markets hypo. The fascinating thing about this is that the returns themselves show no correlation at all (at any time scale), but the *absolute* returns do. i.e. following a sharp rise/drop in price, you can predict that a sharp rise/drop is likely to follow, you just can't say in which direction. And this effect carries over for long periods. Given that by the central limit theorem the sum of identically distributed random variables converges to a gaussian, leads one to think that short term returns *ought* to be gaussian also. However, they're not. Evidently there is something very subtle going on.
