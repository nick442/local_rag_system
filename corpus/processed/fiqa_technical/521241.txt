"When the pie is being hoarded, this is what happens. It happened in the 20's, it happened in the 1850-90's. Great depressions don't cause poverty, they unveil the economic conditions that already exist and remove the safety nets that keep the problems from appearing catastrophic when in fact, they already are. The current P/E of most of the stocks that under-gird our economy are so far out of whack that markets don't even consider them anymore, but the reality is that they are unsustainable. To return to sustainable levels would require, in some cases, a 90% ""adjustment"" in values. While the Dow Jones is not the economy, what do you think the economic effects of even a 50% drop would be on the 78% of the population that lives paycheck to paycheck? Consider the knock-on effects?"
