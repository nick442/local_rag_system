I meant mathematics as a class not as a subject. I like mathematics I and II, where we are being taught a whole bunch of infinitesimal and differential calculus linear algebra and some more stuff that I can't recall. I really like those classes , maybe because they are easier for me to understand. There have been certain parts of statistics which I got the point and I really liked the looks of it but I let go and now I fell behind. I will try my best to better myself but the semester is over so I am on my own now. Anyways thanks for your help.
