Bad concept. American sprawl is still part of the landscape and until we start seeing mass migration back to dense urban living scapes bigger cars will prevail. It's not so bad when you can buy a Honda Accord sedan that gets 40+ mpg..I so badly want revolution but the fact is transition will take longer than anyone really imagines.
