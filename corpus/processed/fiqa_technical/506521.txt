"The geniuses behind this ""infographic"" are part of a marketing industry trend that aims to exploit social media as a free advertising medium, period. Reddit is difficult to advertise for free on, and the writer of this blog post admits to this. In an attempt to be more clever than all the other ""social media experts"" out there, they are making the claim that a marketer can get on Reddit, establish a presence as a redditor, then start shilling. These claims are not only impossible to verify, but the effort it would take to do something like this just to do marketing seems like a bad investment. In addition to the things they mention on their little chart, redditors do not like being manipulated by marketers and would downvote at best and get you banned at worst. Unless there is something about Reddit that I don't know, which is certainly a possibility."
