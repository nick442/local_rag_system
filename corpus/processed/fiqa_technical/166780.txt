The success of any business or company lies in its well-established organization structure. Just as a building requires proper construction to stand still for a long time, a proper structure is required for an organization to work effectively. Here are some of the methodologies in which you can structure your business. 1. Chain of command Depending on the size of your organization, you can either build a long chain of command or a short chain of command. Chain of command refers to who you should report to within your organization. 2. Span of Control This is a basic element in an organization structure. It refers to how many subordinates can a higher authority person handle. For example, a CEO can handle 4 persons under him and then these 4 persons can further handle a specific amount of subordinates under them. This is referred to as a wide span of control. On the contrary, there is a narrow span of control also. 3. Centralization In centralization process, the decision-making power is focused at a single point. This is beneficiary for an organization to work effectively when compared to decentralization. 4. Specialization Again you can divide it into two categories. Employees working under high specialization get the benefit of mastering over a particular aspect. While those working under low specialization get the chance to explore every area but they can’t master their skills in a specific area. 5. Departmentalization If a company follows rigid departmentalization then there might be least or no interaction between different teams. Opposite to this, loose departmentalization provides the benefit of interaction and collaboration between different teams. If you think that these things won’t work out or you need to have a detailed study on this subject, then you can feel free to seek the help of [Business Coaching] (https://www.getdrona.com/business-coaching/).
