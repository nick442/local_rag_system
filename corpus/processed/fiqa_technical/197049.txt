"OO = online only It is funny to watch the know-nothing millennial tech professionals try and figure shit out like OO (***Q:*** ""Why do I need a mattress store?"") The people that are buying these mattresses are under 30, tech/sales, *sans* car, micro-tenancy, tech culture, etc. More importantly, the millennials are probably the least intelligent ""consumer"" generation but highest consumption rate of ""goods"". The OO mattress companies success/failure ratio is predicated on one thing; brand propigation and conformity (imitation) of lifestyle through contrived advertisements. Couple this with poor reasoning skills (consumption, ""intrinsic value"") of your typical millennial consumer and voila! ***A:*** For something you'll spend a 1/3 of the time on for however you long you own it, you definitely want to evaluate it as you'll use it. And you know capitalism is corrupt so expect nothing from OO mattress brands. But I'd like to add that if your common sense does not lead you to the mattress store, you're likely fairly idiotic and peculiar to begin with."
