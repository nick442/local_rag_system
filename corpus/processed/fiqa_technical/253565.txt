This is great news. EVs are growing so fast. Their reduced fuel and maintenance costs will be a great boon to the economy. I wouldn't be surprising to see EVs take a significant share of the auto market in the coming years (they were ~1% in 2016). Innovation drives economic growth. It's also good for the environment (the electricity used is much cleaner than gasoline/diesel) and electrical grid (increased demand that's potentially responsive to system load helps finance smart grid improvements).
