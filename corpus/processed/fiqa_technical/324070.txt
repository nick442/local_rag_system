I'm going to go out on a limb and say the issue isn't so much construction productivity as it is financial security. It's not uncommon for large projects to start off the belief that the money will show up by the time the project is over, look at the US, major road projects are started off the assumption that tax receipts will pay for the roads if the receipts don't then everything gets back logged which just costs even more money as nothing is done.
