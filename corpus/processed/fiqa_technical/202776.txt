"Crickets here, so I'll respond with what I ended up doing. At the end of each month, I download transaction data from each of Stripe and PayPal. For each, I do the following: So it is just six entries in Wave per month plus a little spreadsheet manipulation to determine revenues and fees. Takes about 10 minutes to do this. I really dislike Wave's ""automatic"" integration with PayPal. It creates a lot of entries, and it also doesn't seem reliable so it is easy for transactions to get lost."
