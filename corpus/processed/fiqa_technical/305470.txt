I do this all the time with around 5 credit cards (Chase Slate, Bank of America, Capital One, Barclay Card, and Discover). They will all send me balance transfer checks every month with rates ranging from 0% to 5%. Chase has some of the best rates (0-2% for 16 months). BofA has the best APRs, in case I need to keep the balance on for several months after the transfer expires. Generally you don't need to jump through hoops to get the money in your bank account. They will usually either wire it directly or you can just deposit the check. Do make sure you read the fine print on the offer. Most of the time, the offer will show up as a standard balance transfer. Sometimes, they may designate one of the checks as cash advance with much higher rates. Always double check the transfer fee and post-expiration APR. Recently did it with Barclay Card and Bank of America, both at 2% for 12-18months.
