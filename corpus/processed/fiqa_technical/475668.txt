For reference see this article. This article does an okay job of explaining why, but it could be better. To expand on point #4 if you lose your job, you will be forced to repay the loan in 90 days. If do not pay it back in time, you will be hit with your highest marginal tax rate and a 10% penalty. How does borrowing money at 40% interest sound? Why do you have credit card debt? I'll give you the loving answer: bad behavior. The longer you hold this debt the more indicative it is about out of control behavior. To remedy this I would recommend the following: While you are behaving like most people (normal); most people are broke. Congratulations on having the desire to not be broke. Do you now have the courage to change? Having that courage could mean generational wealth building and freedom from debt. As a reformed overspender it has meant exactly that for me and my family.
