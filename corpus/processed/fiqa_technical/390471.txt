I don't get that comparison at all. The guy still gets his. Business profits go up and down. Real CEO's figure out how to make more profits under given circumstances. Whiny children complain about it not being fair and fire all their staff out of spite. If I was a shareholder I'd be worried. Not about Obama but about the loose cannon CEO that is threatening to devalue my stock out of spite because he doesn't know how to run a business properly.
