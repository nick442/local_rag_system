>His support seems to have a floor of around 30%, unfortunately; so, nearly 1/3 of the population (which is still way too high). His support is not 30% of the population. He got 19% of the US populations vote, and his [disapproval numbers have only gone up while approval has gone down.](http://www.gallup.com/poll/201617/gallup-daily-trump-job-approval.aspx) With that in mind, the argument that he has more support now than on election day has very little merit, while the argument that he has less support than election day is pretty well supported. Trump likely has the support of about 15% of the population.
