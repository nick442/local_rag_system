I live in suburban Washington DC. The houses in my old neighborhood that used to sell for $500K to $600K were renting for about $2,500 because that's all the market could bear. My mortgage was about $3,100 but I could never have rented it out for that. Owners were taking a loss every month just to keep the house. Like I said earlier though, that same house is now only worth $328K. They're still renting for the same $2,500 per month that they did before the value plummeted. I did downsize a bit when I moved to my new house. Went from 4 very large bedrooms to 4 moderate bedrooms (1 is kinda small) and went from 3 bathrooms to 2. But the plot is much larger now than my previous house. Before felt like a McMansion and now it feels like a cozy cottage but I'm sure a lot of that is my perception of the whole situation.
