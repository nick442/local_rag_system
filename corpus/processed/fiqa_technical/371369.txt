I think older Americans are definitely in the buy American camp, but they're a dying breed. My grandpa spent the better part of his life actively avoiding any Asian products. He was a WWII vet who just couldn't support any Asian company. Swore he'd never do it. His last car purchase? Hyundai. Their improved reliability and warranties sold him. He's since changed his purchasing behavior, but only after far too many shitty American products, including cars. Excluding American truck buyers, I think the American car love is a generational thing. American automakers shouldn't assume that national pride will save them, because the younger generation doesn't care about invisible lines that divide countries. Besides, many Toyotas are now more American than American branded cars. It's silly to group them by brand today.
