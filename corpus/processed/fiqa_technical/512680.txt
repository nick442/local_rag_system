VBA is valuable and I use it all the time but the reason I didn't mention it is because I question its long term value. There is a shift underway in my industry (energy trading) away from excel. Things have become so data intensive that models can no longer survive in excel alone, everything has to be built in R and housed on a SQL database. The older analysts only know excel and some of them VBA, it is killing them as fewer and fewer employers will even look at a resume that doesn't have R on it.
