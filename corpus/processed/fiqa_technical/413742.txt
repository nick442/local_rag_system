"That's weird, because I think of money managers as people who ""manage money"". Based on the history of the Medallion Fund, the fund seems to consistently turn money into ""more"" money, and rarely seems to turn it into ""less"" money, which seems to indicate that it's pretty good at ""managing"" the ""money"" that it's been entrusted with."
