Sure, Walmart is doing fine; at their size and buying power, if they weren't, it'd be a sign that we're in more economic trouble than we thought. Some things I've noticed each time I've shopped at Sears in recent years (usually because I needed certain things quicker than the Internet could provide): there's usually no one around to help, their product choice is rather limited, and their prices can be surprisingly high compared to competitors even in the same mall.
