I first must commend you for finding the article considering it was 2004. (Nice find!). Also, I'm guessing you are going to be dead right with the feelings towards Facebook. The success or failure will be pretty polarizing because I either see them having a $150 billion market cap at the end of 8 years or we will have conversation about Facebook as we do with Myspace. Thanks again for posting the article!
