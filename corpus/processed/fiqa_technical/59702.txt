The incestuous relationship between America's richest one percent and their political lackeys and lobbyists is sickening American society, and yet the press pretends that everything will be just hunky-dory when housing starts pick up. The politicians manage to conduct political campaigns totally devoid of the real issueâ€”the huge and growing gap between the rich few and the impoverished many. Meanwhile our police, who are supposed to protect us, harass citizens exercising their First Amendment rights to assemble and protest injustice. Wake up, Wall Street: you can't shove this under the rug.
