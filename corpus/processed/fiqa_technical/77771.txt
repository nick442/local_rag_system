There's no downplaying the importance of something as simple as that. But I think that Future covers it: > Employees care about your businessâ€¦ but only when you prove you care about them first. Managers have the most immediate influence over the comfort of their employees while on the job. Comfortable office furniture, equipment that doesn't suck, amenities to make being at work more of a pleasure - all means of showing employees they're treated as valuable professionals.
