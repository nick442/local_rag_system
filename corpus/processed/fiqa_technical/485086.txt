So if I wanted to create my own smartphone navigation app, I would have access to all the same collected data Google has? Or are you saying I'd have the same ability to collect data? I'm talking about the economy of scale relating to data. Google/Waze have tons of users and user data, which allows them to tailor their services very well. As a small start up, I wouldn't have access to this data right? Google owns it. They bought Waze do double down on their data. How does a small firm build something very reliant on data, if it hasn't collected any? If this data isn't important, why do the big guys buy out firms that have this data? I think smaller firms have the ability to collect and process data, but the vast amounts of info Google, Amazon, and the other giants allows them to make better decisions and build better products. Smaller firms without years of data collection or the ability to buy the data, are extremely disadvantaged.
