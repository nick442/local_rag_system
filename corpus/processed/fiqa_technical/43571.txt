Sherlock Holmes?!? Shit has to go public domain sometime. The saying is there's nothing new under the sun and that's true. Everything is built on the work of others. Music, literature, painting, sculpture, science, industry, everything. By keeping works out of the public domain for so long, we stunt our culture. Copyright terms need to be reigned back in and set at a reasonable amount of time.
