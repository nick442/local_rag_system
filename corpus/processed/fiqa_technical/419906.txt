"Sorry, but that IAMA reads like total bullshit to me. All his answers are totally generic / tailored to the redditry - ""the best thing about being rich is being able to help my family"" and ""i'm a 25 year old multimillionaire and if the salesmen at the car dealership don't take me seriously I drop a quarter mill on a Ferrari, just to spite them""."
