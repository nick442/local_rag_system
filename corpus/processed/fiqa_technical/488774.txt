Walmart is one of the biggest low wage employers. Let's say $1B of the $2.66B is spent on subsidizing Wal-Mart employees. That's >$3 per US citizen, that we all pay and cannot put back into the economy how we wish. I don't even shop at wal mart and I'm forced to subsidize their employees. IMO, that is not fair. This just incentivizes walmart to hire more cheap government-subsidized employees, rewarding walmart's on my back. So let's do this: For every government dollar spent on helping low-wage employees subsist, we tax the employer the same dollar. From this I bet we would see walmart building housing for their employees, maybe even cafeterias, to get them off section 8 / food stamps. That is more efficient than sending money to the IRS, it makes its way to HUD, then to some government employees who are overburdoned, then we pay out section 8 money to landlords. That's inefficient. I know of walmart employees who rely on $1400/month in section 8, so walmart's tax bill would increase substantially, costs would rise, but tax receipts that we all have to currently pay would decrease by the same amount. So overall costs stay them same, but the finances are more efficient and where they should be vs spread around.
