"> They need to obey the same laws that taxi companies are still held to or be fined into oblivion. No thanks. Until ordering a ""regulated"" car becomes as pleasant an experience as using Uber, I'll keep voting with my dollars for uber. Those safety ""features"" and ""regulations"" are superfluous and I don't mind the varying rates uber charges because their drivers don't take me along bullshit routes since it's all recorded on GPS and I can complain to the company for a refund. They will also never refuse to take a credit card, and tipping is automated so drivers never distrust me in the first place. Your ""repercussions"" for discrimination are BS since here [in Washington DC cabbies openly discriminate against black people](http://archive.wusa9.com/news/article/286584/158/WUSA9-Undercover-Cabs-strand-blacks---official-says-its-not-racism) and it's very hard to enforce, whereas with uber, payment information has been processed since the moment you sign up so the driver never has to worry about it. I'm a working professional and I tip well, but I feel self-conscious hailing cabs because I know that white customers get priority. With Uber there's a customer rating that they see that lets drivers know I'm cool and tip well so I always get drivers fast. Also, I've almost missed a flight because a taxi I phone-ordered simply didn't show up; which is just plain incompetent. Stop defending your corrupt industry. You sound like a good guy, go make more money with a superior service instead of using the guns of the law to force uber/lyft into becoming worse services."
