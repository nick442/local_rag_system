Apple fucked up with the last set of iPhones, yet they still sold a ton. I expect the same this time..no major innovation, will still sell a ton globally. Why the fuck is there no major competition outside of Google/Samsung. Oh windows? haha. Seriously, you can see why Amazon would jump in, however stupid of them to do so (not their main business/focus)
