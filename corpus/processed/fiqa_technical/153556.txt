As I've gotten older I've found physical labor to be a required part of my life to be happy. I sit at a desk all week, and on the weekends I go out an remodel my weekend place. I find myself looking forward all week to doing even mundane tasks like chopping wood for winter. Don't get me wrong, I actually love my job. However there is a sense of worth and accomplishment that performing physical labor gives me that an office job can never do.
