"Absolutely. You can trace all of it back to Reagan. His awful Tax Reform Act of 1986 made corporate profits from operations in foreign countries tax exempt, unless and until the corporations chose to ""repatriate"" those profits [i.e. bring them back to the U.S.], in which case they were subject only to a sharply reduced tax. This provision created the huge impetus for U.S. corporations to move their operations, and their jobs, overseas. Reagan initiated the huge increase in income and wealth inequality."
