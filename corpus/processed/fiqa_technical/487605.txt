"Let me ELI5 it for you. It's *illegal* for foreign governments to contribute to or otherwise attempt to affect our elections. Why? This is done to prevent undue foreign influence inside our government. You don't want foreigners, who don't care about America, to be ""pulling strings."" This law is really old and is considered a big deal to keep the elections clean. It's also *illegal* for a US citizen to help a foreign government to influence our election. So you can't collude to help them do the illegal thing. So taking a meeting with Russian government officials in a attempt to get opposition research on a candidate is thus *illegal* because it's helping the foreign power affect our election. Don Jr released emails where he admitted to doing this. That make sense? Also think about it on a practical level. Were the Russian going to give the intel to Don Jr for free? What deal was going to be struck for this compromising info? Nobody knows, but you have to assume it's something of value."
