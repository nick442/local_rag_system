If you pay for a Costco membership, do you think that you have the right to prevent Costco from prioritizing their own in-house products vs. the products of their competitors? You aren't paying an ISP for data any more than you're paying a gas station owner for the gas. The owner of the station simply provides the infrastructure that delivers the gas to your gas tank. The rest of your money goes to the refiner (and they're usually different entities). If the gas station owner owns his station outright, and decides one day to switch from giving you gas from Exxon to giving you gas from BP, you have no right to tell the owner what he can and cannot do with this gas station. Or perhaps you think that you do?
