">It's tremendously more difficult to make large percentage gains on $1 billion than it is to make gains on $1 million. This is true. However, when you consider the 2 and 20 fee structure that is typical of hedge funds, it becomes evident why managing more money is generally better. With a fund with 1B under management, they ""earn"" 20 million dollars for turning the lights on. Even if they only have a 3% return in a given year, that's another six million dollars. A fund managing a million in assets would have to have a return of 40% to net $100,000. So while the law of diminishing returns may be working in your favor if you are managing less money, if your goal is to make money for yourself it's pretty clear why managing more money is better."
