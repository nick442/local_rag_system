Eh? So the free-lance web developer's argument is that using old technology makes your site slower and thus scares customers away. That's exactly what I would expect a freelance web developer to say to try and drum up business, but that's not usually the case at all. Older tech is generally faster than newer tech because it doesn't come pre-built on bloated frameworks. It's usually a static website without a complicated back-end or frontend. There are exceptions, but newer sites are chosen for ease of development, maintanability, and it's what the developers know. Speed is often lost, but it's made up by improvements in the hardware. **Edit**: Oh, I just took a look at your posting history. This is basically your blog spam.
