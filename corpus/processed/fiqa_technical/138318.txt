Yeah well, Wilbur Ross has serious credentials. He's a multi-billionaire who spent 24 years working for the Rothschilds. He served under U.S. President Bill Clinton on the board of the U.S.-Russia Investment Fun. He was the chair of the New York Democratic Party. He's spent most of his life in the investments and commerce sector as well as raising money for liberal causes. He just happened to flip Trump this time around. So it's one of those scenarios where Trump appointed someone with the kind of chops that most people can't even compete with.. if a guy of this caliber gets the numbers wrong, it's an outlier.
