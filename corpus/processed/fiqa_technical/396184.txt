"Sorry for the late reply. > Different ERP systems have different mappings, but there are no unlimited amount of ERP systems. It's actually close to unlimited. Reasons: 1. Even if two customers use the same ERP system, each implement their ERP in a different way. 2. Even if they implement the ERP system exactly the same way, the EDI is done by an EDI subsystem and each customer will implement EDI in a different way. 3. Even if it's the same EDI system and map, each customer may have different meaning to the same data field. For example, one customer definition for Due Date is ""the date the Vendor needs to ship the goods to me"" while the other customer says ""it's the date I want the goods delivered to my warehouse."" 4. Even if all the fields have the exact same definition, the values may be different between the 2 customers. Classic example: while customer A use SKU# ""1234"" for a certain widget made by the vendor, the other customer may use SKU# ""9876"". 5. It's even worse than you think: if say a huge company like Wal-Mart implemented EDI orders in its specific way, Wal-Mart has 100,000 suppliers, so each of those suppliers have to implement the Wal-Mart way of EDI orders. 6. Even worse: when Wal-Mart make a change to their EDI orders (e.g. add a new type of data), 100,000 suppliers have to change their system support the new data requirements. **Do me a favor?
