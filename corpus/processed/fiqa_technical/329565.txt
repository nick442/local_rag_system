VaR does not capture overall risk, it allows you to say a statement, based on our model, K% of the time, losses will not exceed X. The problem is, 1. How accurate is the statement out of sample? 2. What is the marginal value of this number? Are the choices I make better or worse? 3. Even with a 99.999% confidence level what is the cost to the organization if a decision is made when the model is wrong? Personally when running multiple strategies, you always need to factor in model risk in your asset allocation/trading, i.e. either shut down or reduce exposure when assumptions are violated or run something else, for example when correlations between strategies increases, it is logical to downsize exposure to those strategies as the risk factor to equity has increased. 1. in the grand context of a bank/financial institution, if the VaR is wrong we can bankrupt or negative, so we may want to diversify revenue streams by avoiding that risk, for example correlations increase across asset classes. 2. Sizing is a key problem for banks, as the question is does model error across various platforms (FI, EQ, FICC, Transactions etc), happen at the same time?
