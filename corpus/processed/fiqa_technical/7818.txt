Yeah, I get the logic of what you are saying, because his comments are really ambiguous, but his argument is pointing the other way. So what he ACTUALLY means by driving capital overseas is that other countries are seeing greater economic growth overall, and therefore better investment returns (that's why capital is fleeing), but it's because US growth is badly constrained. It's constrained because the Republican stranglehold on Congress is preventing government investment that will support greater corporate growth. I wish he would say it more clearly, but from the context of his comments here (and elsewhere), this is what he means. He is not reversing his former views, but amplifying them.
