>Oh, but when you look at PayPal and VISA/MasterCard, there's like one. Or two. Yeah, no. I work in credit card processing, PayPal isn't even the largest, let alone the only processing company, nor is it the only way (or even the safest or best way) to make online purchases. And Visa/Mastercard don't control the issuing of cards to individuals, banks do. Every credit card is issued by a bank. >Denying legal use of money in a de facto monopoly is to me not morally better than denying legal use of money in a public utility monopoly. No one is denying legal use of money and PayPal is nowhere close to having a monopoly.
