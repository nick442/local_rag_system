You do realize there is such a thing as equilibrum price which is what the market tend to however a single private individual can set any price on anything (that doesn't mean it sells though) Believe it or not overproduction of electricity is a problem, power lines get clogged, when that happens they need to turn the costs down to negative so people consume it instead of it damaging infrastructure, hence negative cost, because at that moment people wish there were less solar panels, not more. Also, my comments were basically a joke, I don't know how you didn't realize that lol
