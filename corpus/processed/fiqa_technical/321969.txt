That guy seems unusually shortsighted to me. Instagram may be worth a billion or not, no one can tell at this time. Who would have guessed in 1975 that there was such a huge market for personal computers? Or in 1990, who would have bet on the on-line search business? All new technology is doubtful at best, anyone who bet on flying cars would have lost everything, but no one knows in advance. It's really stupid to disparage innovations like that. 90% of them may lead nowhere, but the ones that are successful will bring 1000% profits, and no one can tell which one is doomed to failure or not.
