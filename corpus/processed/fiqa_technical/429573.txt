Hmmm . . . I see you writing under the line of perpetrator the name : Government But I’m not seeing that add up at all. Who is pushing the government to break ngbin these laws? “The Government” isn’t a magical, sentient being that makes the choice to support one cause or another. We have the House, the Senate, and the President. The laws have to pass through all three. So how are ridiculous laws getting pushed through all 3?
