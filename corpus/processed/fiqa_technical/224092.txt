Proper enforcement of laws currently on the books that should have prevented a company like Citi from selling loans that violated their own underwriting standards would have knocked out a huge part of it. Banks would have been a lot less willing to give loans to people who couldn't afford them if they knew that they couldn't flip them on the secondary market.
