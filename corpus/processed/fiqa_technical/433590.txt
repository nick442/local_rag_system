"> BP's spill happened because a complex organizational structure didn't work as intended That is one way to put it. There were more than a few checks and balances that had to fail for it to get as far as it did. Further they knew the risks, it wasn't called ""Deep water horizon"" for kicks. Either way, I've not heard good things about BP from ex-employees. Both about BP's internal attitude towards general safety and risk reduction. While other employees from other companies its a much broader mix of positive/negative."
