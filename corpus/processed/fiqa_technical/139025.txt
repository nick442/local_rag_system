"Question: Why is ""negative equity"" on a home such a huge deal? Whether or not your home equity/mortgage balance is positive or negative, it's not like your monthly payments are changing at all, right? Regardless of if you have a mortgage or were renting an apartment, you'd still have to pay to live there, right? If every month you're still going to be out $1000 one or another, some equity is better than no equity right?"
