The facet of this that I find most intriguing is that our media companies are much smaller than most corporations. According to the lawsuit, BPI claims that they were caused $5.7 **billion** dollars in damages. It claims that they were seeing $650 million in annual revenue before the story. The numbers are so huge that anyone causing any disruption to such a large corporate machine is something that cannot be repaid. Imagine if you caused that company a 1% decline in sales. That's $6.5 million. Can you pay restitution on that? Our corporations are too large, and their power is too great. We need to break shit like this up.
