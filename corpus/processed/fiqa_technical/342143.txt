They actually do handle large scale natural disasters. However this is when the Insurance companies' reinsurance contracts kick in. One insurance company can have multiple reinsurance contracts to help them mitigate disasters like this. The insurance company might be on the hook for the first 25 million of a catastrophic event, then a reinsurance company A will be on the hook for the next 50 millions in excess of the first 25 million, then reinsurance company B will be on the hook for the next 25 million in excess of the first 75 million, etc. Reinsurance is essentially insurance for insurance companies (joking called insurance inception). Additionally reinsurance companies can get reinsurance, called retrocession. Source: I work for a specialized insurance banking and finance group in Dallas.
