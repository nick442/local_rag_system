"There is *some* merit to it, in that [federal gross receipts are largely uncorrelated with tax rates](https://i0.wp.com/wichitaliberty.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/top-federal-personal-income-tax-rates-tax-receipts-2014-02.png). There are two somewhat perverse consequences of that fact - First, raising taxes **doesn't** raise revenues, meaning we can't actually pay for ""moar free stuff from Uncle Sam!"" merely by adding an offsetting tax increase. And second, raising taxes on group-X (ie, the rich) to make them pay their ""fair"" share flat-out *doesn't work*, it's effectively just kicking them in the balls because we grudge them for having more money than we do. Now, as to whether or not lowering taxes really encourages companies to hire more and pay better - That's an entirely separate issue from whether or not it's revenue neutral from the perspective of the federal government. Fortunately, we have a recent historical example - Reagan did exactly that, which ushered in a period of corporate greed and erosion of workers' rights not seen since the end of the days of the Robber Barons. So on the front-end, Trump's not wrong; on the back end, he's trying to sell us unicorn farts."
