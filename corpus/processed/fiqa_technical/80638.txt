"With any institution or organization, you're always going to have top, middle, and bottom performers. I don't think we should select prospective employees based on schools or brands, but the world is a vast place and having those things like brands as markers or indicators serves as a practical heuristic for recruiters. However, Many of my past colleagues from non ""top brand"" institutions are just as smart and capable. The idea is that the more selective the educational institution, the more likely it is to filter for top candidates who can then be fed into companies down the road. But the reality is that the filter is very narrow due to class size and school size so a lot of equally qualified candidates also get filtered out of the school because of marginal differences or sometimes just random luck. Therefore these incredible students end up attending their next top choice. That's the reason we shouldn't only hire from top schools. More talented people overflow to other schools. As a side note, Malcolm Gladwell is like the Myth Busters tv show, but for books. Entertaining, but ultimately flawed in several ways that he analyzes statistics and interprets data.
