You Americans have got to start understanding that tax is NOT theft. And while I applaud the notion of never increasing taxes at a rate higher than inflation, the idea of reducing park maintenance so that rich residents don't have to face a very slightly higher rates bill is an effective demonstration of what's wrong in America today. It's not just about YOU. You are a member of a community, and you must contribute to that community in whatever portion is required in order to assure the smooth running of the community. And the lovely thing is, if you don't like the way it's being run, you can get yourself elected, *and change it*.
