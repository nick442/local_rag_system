I love reddit, but it is an extremely outdated business model. Modern social media platforms like Youtube and Instagram go out of their way to encourage user-generated content and entrepreneurship. Their algorithms notice what you've been watching, in my case RedLetterMedia, and push me similar, albeit lesser known content, like Jenny Nicholson or Every Frame a Painting. Contrast that to Reddit where on most subreddits original content is outlawed. Linking to a blog, a video, a podcast, a website, an app, etc is labeled self-promotion and results in a ban. So without original content, this is what you get: memes, LA Times articles, cat videos, and noob questions. I was recently told by a moderator that original content was unnecessary because of all the great content put out by corporations. Im suspicious if this isnt the notion more mods have. And it's an extremely outdated notion. User-generated, niche content, is clearly the way the internet is trending, and reddit will likely never adjust.
