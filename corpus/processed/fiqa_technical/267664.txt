> Apple .. Tesla and Switch .. billion dollar investments in Virginia City, Nevada...The tech population has begun moving into cheaper areas already Um, all of those tech company investments are for server farms, which provide very few jobs. So long as power and connectivity is available, it doesn't matter where a server farm is located and of course companies try to put them in places where it's cheapest. What this does *not* represent is tech moving out of Silicon Valley and into Nevada. Just how many jobs do you think were relocated from Silicon Valley for these investments? I would guess few, if any at all. Though lower cost is certainly attractive to corporations, a Nevada lifestyle is apparently still not attractive for tech workers.
