"I agree it seems insulting to pay the credit reporting agencies, but I have no choice at this point. I'd rather pay the small fee per each of them, to freeze accounts, then have thousands stolen. My husband has excellent credit and also we have a rather substantial savings account, that his info could give ""would be"" identity thieves access too. This whole situation is messed up, and unacceptable! For one, no one EVER gave these credit reporting agencies access to their info, it's just a ""give in"" being born here. And for two, no one asked for their information to be kept in insecure databases. Higher standards need to be implemented. My poor 72 year old father is outraged when I tell him his info is online. He says, ""I don't use the Internet! How can it be there?!?!"" (Poor old soul lol) I just said, ""well dad, it is, whether you use it, or like it or not. It's there"" I just need to make sure we are taking the correct steps to protect ourselves. Honestly, I am not finance savvy. This is why I'm asking here in this sub. Thank you for responding, and thanks to anyone else who may offer any advice. I'm not terrified, but I'm definitely miffed.."
