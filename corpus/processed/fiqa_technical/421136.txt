"I think this phrase originates from when it was common to have an assumable mortgage. In that case, you would ""take over payments"" and the loan would become yours. From Investopedia: Assumable Mortgage: A type of financing arrangement in which the outstanding mortgage and its terms can be transferred from the current owner to a buyer. By assuming the previous owner's remaining debt, the buyer can avoid having to obtain his or her own mortgage."
