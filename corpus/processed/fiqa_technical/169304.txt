"> ..the only justification for the existence of a state is the protection of your rights and freedoms from others. Okay, why? > Capitalism is based on..respect for each other's property. That is not enough. We have seen that corporations will push limits regularly which shows little respect for the law or other people's property. Without the concept of corporate person-hood, a impartial judicial system to settle disagreements, and enforcement significantly more powerful than all actors, corporations would have little reason to heed claims of property. Ownership would become a question of what you can control, not what you made/traded for. The word to describe when institutions control the land, people, and product by force: feudalism, the precursor to capitalism. > Every other system can be defined as a restriction to capitalism. Don't agree. Once again I think your arguments just assume that capitalism and its effects are ""correct"". > However mandatory public healthcare is not. You're just repeating your claim. Tell me why. > The driving force behind all the benefits of capitalism is competition.. Competition is important in capitalism but it doesn't solve the problem of how the money sucks money to the top. Instead of all the money going to one person it would now all go to a small group, just enough to meet the competition requirements. > ..redistribution of wealth won't stop its formation. Redistribution of wealth isn't about preventing monopolies. It is about reversing the trend of money moving up towards the wealthy in a capitalist system."
