Ok, should I have been more specific in saying monetary assets? Also, why would a 100% marginal tax be required? Next, how do the wealthy become/stay wealthy? They've mastered the rent seeking economy, they've mastered tax loopholes/evasions, etc.. Yes, I apologize my few comments are not outlining the entire structure of my point. Nonetheless, I think we can agree that the current state of the economy is in the shitter (at least for the working/middle class); and will only continue to do so. Unless we reform in several major areas, taxation on the 1% being one of them.
