Dude, from my first comment my only argument is that the degree alone doesn't define competence. I've been consistent and haven't change my mind on anything. I also never agreed that she got the job due to connections: haven't even taken a position on that since I don't know how she got it. You kept imagining meant things I never said. Ghe sort of HR departments you're describing re nepotism etc are themselves incompetent. Contractors, on the other hand, perfectly fine.
