You expect my 65-year old aunt who just had a quadruple bypass to move out of the town where all her children and grandchildren live and where she's lived for over 40 years with her retired and disabled husband? Her town is surrounded by farmland, so she'd have to move quite some distance. I think you're lacking perspective. Moving is expensive and difficult, especially for seniors.
