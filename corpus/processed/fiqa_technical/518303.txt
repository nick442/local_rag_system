"It's mine, dude. And it has resonated. You know what I'm angry about? Watching smart people I know -- friends, even -- be duped and fucked over by their VCs. I have personally known quite a few ""famous"" startup founders and watched them get dicked around and have their companies destroyed. They don't blog about it. Why? They're scared. Or they're under NDA. Obviously my blog post seemed totally worth reading to the nearly 500 people who tweeted it (and founders who reached out to me privately), so let's just say that a few angry redditors won't exactly keep me up at night. This is what resonance looks like: http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=http%3A%2F%2Funicornfree.com%2F2011%2Ffuck-glory-startups-are-one-long-con%2F"
