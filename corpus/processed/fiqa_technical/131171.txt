"Suggesting your own wares when people ask you where to buy something isn't ""anti-competitive."" They are not a public service. The user chose Google and there's no shortage of alternative search engines. Anyone searching for services to find flights - e.g. by typing in ""online travel agent"" - will still find those services fairly ranked. They're not even presenting the information as a standard result - it's a direct answer, like when you search with mathematical expressions. Does that feature give Wolfram Alpha grounds to complain about Google muscling in on the math business? Do we really want to establish binding legal precedent that search engines can only return naive results?"
