> The reason that the minimum wage exists is because of protectorate and nationalist business practices, nothing more. It may be a good thing, and a right thing, and I agree that it is, but it isn't because of compassion. It's because at the time that the concept of minimum wage was negotiated and discussed, there wasn't really such a thing as outsourcing. Companies could not outsource their labour to other markets, because for a large time there was no other market to outsource to. The concept of shipping jobs to China, or India, or Brazil, or, in fact, anywhere else, simply didn't exist. Can you explain how minimum wage laws were a result of protectorate and nationalist business practices? Thanks in advance.
