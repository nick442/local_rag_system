Yes, there is debtor's prison in the U.S. But you don't get sentenced because of the debt itself, but because you are not paying as much as a judge deems reasonable. Tens of thousands of mostly men are in jail because they are not able to pay an amount set by the court. Here is a balanced article that explains the situation: http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/20/us/skip-child-support-go-to-jail-lose-job-repeat.html Note that the court does not need to prove your guilt. You also can end up in jail even if you have absolutely no ability to pay: In the Georgia class-action case, the plaintiffs were jailed in civil contempt-of-court proceedings in which they did not have lawyers. They included three veterans â€” one who had paid $75,000 in child support but fell behind when he lost his civilian job because of combat-related stress and family deaths; a second who was mentally ill and had a letter from a Veterans Affairs doctor saying he was unable to work; and a third who was incarcerated despite having paid $3,796 toward his debt by working odd jobs. Note that in these court proceedings you do not have the right to a lawyer and you are not presumed innocent.
