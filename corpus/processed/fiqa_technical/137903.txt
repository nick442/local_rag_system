Couldn't you say the reverse, the lower investors are taxed, the more willing they are to invest into risky investments like sub-prime mortgages? Edit: I think the major point John is trying to get across is that their are a myriad of factors that motivate people, profit is one of them, but not the only one. And this business/financial culture thrives on and breeds people who's sole motivate is profit. Not helping the world, or creating something interesting, or feeding children, or creating a better quality of life for society, but pure profit above all else. So if profit is your only motivation for anything, then having a 3% greater tax rate is completely uncalled for.
