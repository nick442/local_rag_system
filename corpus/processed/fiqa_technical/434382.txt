Ah, yes. The report that makes some very strange assumptions, such as the following: * People drive less than 100 miles per week (5,170 miles per year, or just over 14 miles a day). * People are moving at all times while driving and at a constant speed. * The factories making the batteries are entirely powered by fossil fuels. * Your non-electric vehicle had zero emissions during its own production. * You don't have a lead-acid battery in your non-electric vehicle. * Your non-electric vehicle took no emissions to reach the lot where you bought it. With a narrow-enough constraint, a person can make anything appear true. However, once those constraints are themselves examined, the silliness of it becomes quite clear.
