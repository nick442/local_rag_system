Speaking as a CFA charter holder in an alternative asset class, the CFA designation is beneficial to any role in finance. Not only does it provide a framework for understanding economics, accounting, financial instruments and markets, etc, the real value to me, is the signal it provides to others. For me, the CFA signals a level of intellectual sophistication and work ethic that employers, prospects, etc. Maybe asset management jobs aren't as in demand as previously, but I'm sure a CFA charter holder has a better chance of finding a retaining that role
