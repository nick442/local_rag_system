Wow. Just goes to show lack of understanding or ignorance. No. America is not a country, but continents. No US is not protectionist. It is more global then ever. If you thought we are now protectionist, you were fooled by Trump. >Also I notice that in you trying to cite that graph of the top countries with Tariffs, China and the United States are still in the top 5. So what are you objecting to, that I did not include Brazil and India in my original list? It seems like Russia is the only one not on that graph. If you extended this to all countries Canada would still be in the top 10. You really fucked yourself over here. Lol. What kind of cognitive dissonance is it? Are you joking you saying 1 % tarrif is protectionism? I cant tell if it is your lack of understanding, denial, getting fooled or what. >VENEZUELA IS NOT ON THAT LIST YOU LINKED. Where did I say said it was? Edit. Nice changing the topics btw. LOL Russia. LOL. You must be one of those putin supporter
