My girlfriend has a Nook, and I had tried using an older Sony e-reader my mom bought and never used. It's just not for me. I much prefer the actual, physical book. It just seems silly to me to buy books and then have them all on this device that so easily gets lost. And I love technology, I use it all the time and I try to keep myself in the know on the cutting edge stuff. E-readers are just something I can't get into. I just much, much prefer a physical book. Turning the pages, smelling the book, making annotations, highlights, notes, and putting in post its to save your notes is just something you can't do as well or at all with an e-reader.
