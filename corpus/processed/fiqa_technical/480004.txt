Those brick-and-mortar fronts are there for businesses that ran out of supplies and didn't plan ahead and need them immediately. It's cheaper to buy the same shit online, if you plan ahead. They're always empty when I go there too. I go there rarely. Usually to see how ridiculous their markup is and how much I can save by buying the same shit from amazon.
