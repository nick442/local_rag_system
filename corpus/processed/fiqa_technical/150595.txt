This is why I'll never be a CEO of anything. If I got all that money, and then didn't have a job, I'd for sure not be trying to get another one of those jobs. My ass would be gone. I don't care enough to try hard enough to ever get to that position. I have zero drive for that sort of thing. It doesn't even seem like a job I can understand someone wanting.
