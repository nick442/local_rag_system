No rep from amazon has ever stroked my ego, so I don’t know what you mean. And as far as “reps” go - people who help you with products beyond paint and decor rarely understand what they are selling - hence the “1 guy” they all depend on, vs the staff at a home store in Japan who all work in areas they know. So. what exclusives? Are you buying tractors or some shit? Forklifts full of A-C subfloor? If you are buying enough to save “hundreds of dollars” at a time, I assume you are a contractor, and you a) should already know your shit, so reps are just there to prepare paperwork, and b) missing the point of what I am saying. If I call a parts supply warehouse and ask them for a [661-8124](http://www.powerbookmedic.com/parts/661-8124/Logic-Board-35GHz-Core-i7-Quad-Core-4GB.html), I’m not going to ask them what model it goes in or how to install it. The rep’s competence could easily be replaced by Amazon. If I have A broken Mac, I want to go to a store where they know how to fix it and give me advice, and in that manner Home Depot often falls flat. So they will eventually get their hat handed to them - because eventually Amazon will beat them in distribution and they won’t have the volume to warrant a chain of stores to draw foot traffic.
