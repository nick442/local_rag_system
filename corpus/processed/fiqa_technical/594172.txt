"Comment from the article: ""In effect, Google acquired the talent it needed, got the IPR it wanted, and did not have to purchase the whole company and bring in the baggage it did not want. What an Amazing deal for Google. I have no idea where this leaves HTC, though."" Could not agree more. Not sure how HTC is winning in this aspect. I guess we will have to wait and see."
