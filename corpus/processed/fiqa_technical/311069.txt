> You also have to think about tax on dividends from these stock options, which is only 15%, which is paltry to regular incometax rate that the rich pay on their salaries dividends is just cash being removed from companies and being paid out directly to the stockholder if dividends get taxed at a higher rate, every company would just use that same cash to buy back shares since that would be more tax efficient - the stockholder would receive compensation in higher stock prices which they could then sell instead of receiving a dividend. Thus, they would pay capital gains rate instead of your new dividend rate. The dividend rate must be the same as capital gains rate for this reason. They are not free money since the stock price gets decreased when a dividend is paid out - the company gets poorer when they pay out the dividend.
