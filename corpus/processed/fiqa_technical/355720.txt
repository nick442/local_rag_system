>Salary divided by hours worked (or even effort for that matter) ignores economies of scale. No, not at all. Let's go back to Economics101. When more units of a good or a service can be produced on a larger scale, yet with (on average) less variable input costs, economies of scale are said to be achieved. The good produced in our comparison is salary. The variable input costs are hours worked. The fixed costs are an annual time period, ie, it takes them both one year to produce their annual salary output regardless. We have two guys, one is making 100k annually working 5 hours a week. The other makes 500k working 80 hours per week. They both have a the same fixed costs of time period of a year. If we plot them both on a graph, you're correct, the 500k salary output is a larger output, but at much greater variable costs. Efficiency is lost by the guy working 80 hour weeks. The guy getting 100k for 5 hour weeks is optimizing his variable costs much more effectively. Sure, he could make more, but would suffer diminishing returns on his output. Dude above claims that you're not successful unless you make 500k. I was just illustrating that success can be defined outside of straight compensation.
