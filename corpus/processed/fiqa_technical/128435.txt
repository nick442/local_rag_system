"You can't individually have 100% ownership if the 50/50 LLC is the owner of the new business; however, you can be allocated 100% of the profits and losses from the new business with the 50/50 LLC as owner of said business. It requires a new LLC operating agreement that specially allocates profits and losses from the new business to you. There is one catch under the Treasury Regs, the special allocation to you must have ""substantial economic effect"". See Treasury Regulation (26 CFR) Section 1.704-1. http://www.medlawplus.com/library/legal/irsrulings/treareg1704-1.htm"
