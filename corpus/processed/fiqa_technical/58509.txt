Why is it that we, as a society, are wishing, even dreaming that house prices can return to where they once were? It seems so obvious that we play in semi false statistics so we can believe what we simply want to. Who benefits the most from high real estate, is it the banks, home sellers, agents of the industry or perhaps home buyers? Who is more important to a flowing economy the home seller or buyer? Obviously both sides need each others value, so who wins, seems like the bank? Im starting to deeply see how our news and media is blindly dividing our generations while still ignoring the real truths. Depending which way your perspective leans, is it really baby boomers vs the millennials? Heres my sincere question whats good for ALL age groups?
