"If you assign preference to one race over another, you are a racist plain and simple, there are no two ways about it. I really couldn't care less what you or Marc Faber think about that (""so be it I am a racist"" yada), you are a bad person and you deserved to labelled with every such label that follows. For example, if someone would call you a piece of shit I would agree with that person. Your points about ""culture"" making an impact are complete BS, so is saying that you want to ""encourage the efforts of people who made our country great over the actions of people who make our country not so great"" (where have I heard that one before? hint: he recently met with the President of the Virgin Islands..) ""People"" and ""culture"" don't make a country great - consequences do. These consequences could come from a human foreigner's actions (look at the NHS in the UK), or maybe not even from humans, perhaps from the actions of mother nature (look at the Gulf Countries). If you want humans to make their country great, teach them the actions that have the right consequences. The fact that you don't understand this concept makes you an idiot. The fact that you then attribute a country's greatness to race makes you a racist. Together, these facts makes you a racist idiot."
