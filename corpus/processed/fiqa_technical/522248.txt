>Managers do not directly create value for the company. Oh my. Of course they do. Now I can't say that all of them do, there are certainly bad managers out there that destroy value. But it's management's goal to organize the labor and resources in the most efficient way possible, thus creating value. If you put 100 workers in a factory and leave them alone for a week they're not going to know what the hell to do. They need someone to direct them, and make sure they stay the course. An entrepreneur is needed to create a business model that inputs land, labor and capital, and outputs a product or service that people want.
