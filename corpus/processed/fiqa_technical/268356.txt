"Well, one could almost instead think of it as a swap, with no set maturity date. While it might not make sense for most investors, it could be useful to, say, a restaurant or someone who simply *really* likes wines. But yes, from the ""mechanics"" of it, it doesn't make sense. It'd be close to a royalty in that way; taking physical inventory instead, thus costs are there, revenue isn't. I'll flesh it out a bit more mentally, but meh. Just an off-the-wall thought."
