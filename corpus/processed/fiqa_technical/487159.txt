Regarding Asia, I think that it's a matter of relative specialization. HK has primarily developed as the gateway for China financial services, HK will certainly offer Islamic finance, but I don't think that there is a compelling reason why HK would become a hub for such services relative to Singapore. Singapore is at the center of major Islamic populations and is socially and culturally much more capable than HK of serving Islamic finance investors. One possible counterpoint in favor of HK would be the One Belt, One Road initiative - perhaps a lot of the capital accumulation in the OBOR countries (many of which are Muslim) would end up in HK, but whether it has a major impact is more of a possibility than a certainty.
