"No functional difference. Only impression/convenience. ""Business checks"" are checks in larger format (8"" instead of the regular 5"" checks), they can be from your personal account just as well. I didn't have any problem using the small ""individual""-standard checks for my company (I actually did get them for free from Wells Fargo, but that was a gesture, not by policy)."
