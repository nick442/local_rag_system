"Before the IARC listed RoundUp as a probable carcinogen, all other agencies and research were unable to find a link between RoundUp and cancer. Now we learn that the IARC ignored evidence that RoundUp doesn't cause cancer that was done by one of their own scientists. I'm not a fan of Monsanto's business practices, but when you ignore scientific evidence because it doesn't match what you ""feel"" about the company and their products, then you are no different than a climate change denier. http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2017/06/monsanto-roundup-glyphosate-cancer-who/"
