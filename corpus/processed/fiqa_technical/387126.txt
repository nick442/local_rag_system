Hopefully I can make this quick since your time is truncate. No one is happy working 40 hours a week, and quite honestly, I don't think people are even happy working 30 hours a week. People generally do not like labor, especially if it is something they do not find fulfilling. A majority of Americans (and those abroad) only work as a means to survive. Wage (chattel) slavery has never, nor will it ever be a positive attribute to any society. Also, although automation will cut down the time spent working (i.e., no longer required to work 40 hours a week), I am afraid that Americans will find themselves in trouble. If those who are currently working 40 hours a week now cannot afford basic healthcare and necessities of life, then God forbid we witness a reduction in the hours of labor. This will exacerbate the overburden social services (Medicare, Medicaid, SNAP, Social Security, etc.) that the country is currently having difficulties of dealing with as we speak, which will create a recipe for disaster. By the way, I am always willing to chat with people of varying ideas and beliefs!
