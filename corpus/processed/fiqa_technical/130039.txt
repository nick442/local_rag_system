I don't need to back anything up. It will do him good and will help him stand out. Explain why this is not the case - it's on you dumbass. I made the comment 1st, so if you want to refute it then you need to provide proof that my opinion is invalid. As well, I'm reporting you yet again because you're still acting like a child. You're verbally attacking a stranger because of an opinion. Maybe you have an MBA, maybe you don't.. one way or another you don't deserve to be called an adult. This is the 3rd attempt to ask you to be civil and you continue to be insulting, like somehow being Mr. Big on the interwebs makes you special. Grow up you idiot.
