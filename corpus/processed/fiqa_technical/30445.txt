Maybe someone can ELI5 for me: If Obama does happen to raise taxes on businesses, those increased taxes are only on profits, as the taxes were only on profit before. So if a small business loses a little more of its profit, why should it have to lay off people? It still meets its overhead and makes some profit right? Is some % of profit required for a company to keep it's current level of staff?
