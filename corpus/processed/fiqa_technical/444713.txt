I don't think so man.. I mean, don't get me wrong, my girlfriend is a contract worker, but they have some of the most amazing work environments that I have ever witnessed. Catering, telecommuting, free laptops, they have some of the happiest employees I've ever met. And they get paid a fair wage compared to other game companies *Cough*EA*Cough*
