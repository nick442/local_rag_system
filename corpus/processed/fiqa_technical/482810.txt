Think again. **All prosperity** ultimately comes from the generation -the *creation*- of wealth. We create wealth out of the ether when we take a thing -a physical item- which is worth little and turn it into a thing that is worth more with the power of an idea and the application of labor. On a macro scale, that translates into the manufacturing sector. The manufacturing sector in the US has *changed*, it's not gone. It's spectacularly healthy in a plethroa of new ways, while all the old ones have died off or are dying a slow death. The new manufacturing sector demands skill, not just attendance. *Unskilled* work is drying up, because under current laws unskilled people cost more to employ than they can possibly produce, but someone with a skill in trade can get a job in half a heartbeat, especially if they are willing to move to where the job is. No nation of any size can prosper without the internal generation of real wealth. The idea that we can be a nation of bankers and managers is laughable and is precisely what got us into our current situation. The future is and *will always be* in making new things. Labor is not a derogative word and it does *not* equate to a second-class existence, as pay rates are currently demonstrating. It was geniuses working in the trades who were the innovators and entrepreneurs that built American industrial power (thus, economic power) in the first place. It will be again.
