I think you are aiming your crony capitalism shotgun in the wrong direction. Oil industry subsidies dwarf those to the EV, and the bailouts to the US car manufacturers was the clearest example you could imagine of picking winners and losers. Far worse, both the car manufacturers and oil industry represent the entrenched interests which are fighting the future changes in the industry as opposed to the other way around. The money went directly to the companies involved, without a lick of good capitalist competition. Now compare that to a personal EV tax credit. 1) you encourage the clearly visible future of cheap electrical power and driverless EVs, 2) you set up the subsidy as a personal tax break to the buyer, so any company is free to up their game and make better products to win part of it. 3) its a much smaller amount, and much more cost effective per tax dollar than giant checks to monster oil companies. Once the government stops cramming enourmous amounts of money into oil and traditional car companies, then it might be time to relook at saving taxpayer money spent on EVs.
