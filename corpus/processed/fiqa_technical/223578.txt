Hey Buddy, I like how you echo the same BS the top 1% spews. Time to educate you with some simple math (using arbitrary numbers to explain my point). top 1% has $1,000,000 Bottom 80% has $1000 I say bottom 80%, because it is effectively top 1%, next 19%-20%, and remaining 80% Top 1% tax @24.7% --> $1,000,000 / 24.75 = $753,000 Bottom 80% tax @30% --> $1000 / 30 = $700 $753,000 > $700 Do you see the problem? Sure, the rich pay $247,000 in taxes compared to $300 for the bottom 80%. However, the wealth is still greatly disproportionate even after taxes. Hence, why the wealth gap is increasing year over year. *Edit The tax rates @24.7% and @30% are the numbers for 2015, assuming not much has changed since. I am using $1,000,000 and $1,000 as arbitrary representations of wealth; for better understanding the issue.
