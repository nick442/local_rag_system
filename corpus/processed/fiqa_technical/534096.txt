"Depends on what you care about. Economically, ehhh.. We are not at all safe from another 2008-9 event, red or blue. To avoid it buckling much at the seams for another 4 years will be ""interesting"" to say the least, but not completely impossible. I'm pretty pessimistic though. There is a reason the police look and act like they do these days imo and it isn't a peace and love reason. Hopefully there won't be *too* many amoral guard dog humans happy to psychopathically fight for the scraps, but right now it doesn't look very good on avg to me. I have a distant hope that somehow something unexpected or humane happens at the federal level and we are allowed to build ""transition towns"" relatively unimpeded if we are on the outskirts. That'd require the federal government intentionally giving up some of its power and, well.. Cities give me a bad feeling because I don't think tech is the answer. That is kind of a daydream tangent though. tldr I think things are pretty bad as well. I just do the do and prepare in the sane and enjoyable ways that I can. I have a vision of the world and all I can do is get out of the way to let myself do it, dollar bullshit oil bullshit or whatever, you know? I try to see the world after oil/dollar and live in *that*."
