The problem is the H1B program is currently being abused to fill entry level positions, which it wasn't designed to do. Now we have a glut of American entry level tech workers unable to find work because companies use H1B workers to fill entry level spots. Why? Because it's cheaper they can save $10k per year per worker. And here's the real kicker, most of these H1B workers go back to their home country once finished, so the talent and money doesn't stay in the states. And now we have a shortage of senior tech workers because who would have thought that not giving entry level workers here the chance to work, while tossing away the H1B workers every five years, would bite them in the ass?!
