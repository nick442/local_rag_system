Also the margin/popularity of the product. Luxury car dealerships will spend more on a shot at a single sale than a local hairdresser will risk on getting *maybe* ten new customers. Then again, if you hit the right guy on the right day it needn't even make sense. I used to run a tiny annual event with footfall of around 200 and had way more trouble offloading a 1/4 page for £20 to the local cab firm, than a 'co sponsor' slot to a local manufacturing business for £250. Expected return for the cab firm was arguably much higher but the amount was just a fart in a tornado to the bigger business.
