It is absolutley relevant. The minimum wage acts as the base instead of zero and there are a huge amount of jobs that only pay minimum wage. If this idiotic concept were true than the since the minimum wage is the base there would be alot smaller number of minimum wage jobs. Min wage does not deprive people of jobs. It reduces the amount of subsidized labor employers are able to employ. It's biggly sad you don't understand human nature.
