"That's how it works in Sweden too. Women still take up the lions share of the parental leave but every year men take more. I have had several coleagues that have been gone for 4-6 months to take care of the kid so their wives could go back to work. No one finds this strange or tries to guilt people into staying on. Rather it's the other way around. A guy who takes no paternity leave makes people go: ""What are you doing here? You just got a kid! The government is willing to give you free money so you can spend time with said kid. Whats wrong with you? Go be with your family!"""
