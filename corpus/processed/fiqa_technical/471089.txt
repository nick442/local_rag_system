I agree, but we should be careful about how we put a value to the digital sales channel. It doesn't logically follow that 100% of online sales are additional revenue that Domino's wouldn't have seen otherwise. Those same customers could have ordered by phone if the online option weren't available (although I'll bet the fraction of people who would do that is small). Basically, it's dangerous to value mutually exclusive sales channels by the revenue they generate, because not all of that revenue would be lost if the sales channel was axed.
