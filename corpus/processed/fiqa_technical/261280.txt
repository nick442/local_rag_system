No. You don't need to pay the IRS before such a transfer – though you'll need to fill out certain paperwork to report the money transfer to authorities if it exceeds a threshold amount. If the money is income, you'll need to declare it on your income tax return and then pay the taxes due. If it is a gift, other rules apply and tax may be due. Do proper due diligence and consult with a trusted tax professional. However: Please see the comments above – this sounds like a potential scam.
