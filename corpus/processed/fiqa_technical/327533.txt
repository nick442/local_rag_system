That's what I'm saying. But apparently people are doing it. It woulnd't be going up otherwise would it? And isn't that the only way bitcoin or stocks can go up above their last record? If everyone followed that rule. Nothing would ever rise right? I'm sure I don't understand it fully. Stocks and bitcoin's(cryptocurrencies in general) all seem crazy to me.
