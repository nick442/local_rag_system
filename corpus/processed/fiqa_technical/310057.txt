Well, you're wrong. Not paying taxes is actually a *very* American sentiment. I do it because I have to. I don't enjoy it, and it certainly doesn't feel honorable. 95% of my taxes go to a combination of: -Things I hate (Military, Welfare, Social Security, surveillance) -Things I will *never* get to use (Welfare, Social Security, MedicAid) -Things I don't want and didn't ask for (regulatory agencies, Unemployment, militarized police) The other 5% or some other fucking miniscule quantity goes to things I want and use, but would probably still be more efficiently provided by someone else.
