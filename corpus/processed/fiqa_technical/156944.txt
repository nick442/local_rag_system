The jobs in the economy is (generally) fixed -- there are just so many good jobs and so many bad jobs. If someone manages to move from a bad to a good job, they must displace someone who had that good job. At the end of the day we will still need dishwashers and security guards. If you better educate children, you're going to get smarter people who are dishwashers and security guards.
