Because surprisingly few countries actually do the single payer system (i.e. only the government pays all medical bills). Many of the countries everywhere else have multipayer/multitiered systems that guarantee universal coverage. This is usually a combination of strong protections for preexisting conditions, individual mandates, and subsidies. The goal is universal coverage, single payer is just a means.
