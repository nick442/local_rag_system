It's a matter of risk and reward. And its origin goes back to the Black Scholles equation, which is sort of a bell curve of possible outcomes. Do you see that from $36 to $34 strike, you are putting up over 35% more money to lower your break even by 30 cents? If I were to bet* $2000, I could buy 3 of the $34 contracts but almost 5 of the $36 strike. If the stock went to $45, I'd be far better off. *I say 'bet' because simply buying puts or calls, absent any underlying asset, is akin to gambling, not investing. I do it all the time, but with my Vegas money.
