>How will making energy cheaper help? Cheaper energy is equivalent to a pay raise, only it's also good for business interests. That (theoretically) can allow more competitive pricing of other products, since businesses aren't trapped by high energy costs forming a price floor. That part depends on how competitive each individual market is.
