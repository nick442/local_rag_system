To play devil's advocate, could you not also argue that the author correctly framed the article? In 2012, Amazon had primarily (if not solely) an online presence, so there would be no way to have an effect on consumers -- therefore no relevance. However, Amazon made a brick-and-mortar acquisition which will now have a direct effect on consumers by trying to hamper which sites their customers try to access while on wifi and can also be seen as anticompetitive.
