The problem is that once there's no competition, the quality of product will generally go down and/or prices will be raised. What are you gonna do, go somewhere else? No small business can match the prices of a place that ~~can~~* buys product in bulk. Competition is necessary for the free market to not be predatory. Monopolies pretty much always work out to the detriment of the consumer.
