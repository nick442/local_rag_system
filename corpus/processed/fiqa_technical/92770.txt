Depends on your definition of value. Tulips don't carry much value, but their price sure was driven up. It was speculation on the future price tag that lead to the bubble. You might suggest there is actual value in bitcoin. I'd suggest that its a nonproductive asset, and that its held more dear than other identically valuable cryptos, which points to speculation.
