I have comcast and hate their guts. From the time they bought the local cable system a couple of years ago they have raised prices at least 10% a year and at the same time cut 2-4 channels every year. Now they want customers to get a bunch of new equipment, which they claim is free, like the cable modem was free until one month they started charging extra for it every month. I'm not paying any more for their crap. I've let go of everything but the local channels and tomorrow or the next day it will take MORE equipment to even get those. But I've ordered the equipment necessary to get channels off the air. Then once they start messing with my internet I'll try AT&T and satellite internet or even go back to dialup. Cause I'm not paying MORE for less, not paying MORE for crap. Hell, half of what you pay is for sports and I never watch sports. I felt sorry when so many good newspapers started going under. But I feel no sympathy at all for comcast. They are like the Bank of America of cable TV. When they die people will cheer. TV is run by greedy people. I remember when cable started. There were no ads. They made their money from cable subscriptions. Then they decided they wanted MORE money than that and added ads. They can make plenty of money without ads. But there is no end to their greed. So screw them.
