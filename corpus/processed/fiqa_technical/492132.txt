"As reported by ZeroHedge in January 2016: ""While the media claims that this record has been reached because of drastic improvements to the US economy, they are once again failing to account for the central factor: credit expansion."" ""In order to generate more vehicle purchases, these companies have incentivized consumers with hot, hard-to-resist offers, similar to the infamous “liar loans” and “no-money down” loans of the 2008 recession."" http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-01-11/auto-loan-bubble-ready-pop.
