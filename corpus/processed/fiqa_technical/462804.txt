"What are you trying to do Exactly? What is a covariance ""profile""? (Cov Matrix)? Also lose the jargon. From my understanding you want the same covariance in the portfolio, however it doesn't work like that as covariance is an observed matrix. It's hard enough to target variance in a portfolio (see GMV) and to target covariance would be even more difficult. You can attempt to use the weights you have right now in terms of exposures, but LEAPS may give you unwanted theta. Are you long short or long only? if you're long only the interplay between the positions is rather irrelevent, as right now all that matters are the weights."
