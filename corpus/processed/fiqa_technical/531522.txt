There's an interesting inter-generational dynamic at play here. The Fed (and tax policy) has encouraged asset appreciation for decades to generate wealth effect, keep consumer spending up, and push economic growth. This was great at the time, and benefited asset owners. Unfortunately over a long period of time, this has led to great income inequality. It's also raised home prices to a level where millennials (and anyone else without a house) to find real estate to be unaffordable. Adjusting the tax code and putting pressure on prices would slow the economy. It could also create a recession. It would probably put the economy on a stronger footing for growth into the future.
