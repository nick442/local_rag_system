A fourth of the population has an IQ below 90. They have a tough time making informed decisions. There's also a lot of people with no money, or can't take care of themselves for god knows why. They need basic healthcare. Not insurance, but clinics for the basic stuff. generic drugs only, no organ transplants, no kidney dialysis. If you wanted, and had the money, you could buy iinsurance for better care. This is, more or less, the system in France.
