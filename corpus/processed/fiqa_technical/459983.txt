This is the 21st century. What do people expect? The Mongolians to attack? How is a dumb wall gonna help. He could pay for the stupid wall himself if he wants to make a statement. Or maybe his supporters should donate money for it and volunteer their time to build the worthless thing. Border wall is one of his dumbest campaign promises. We have so much better technology to do so much more for border security than a stupid wall. Put the money to better use.
