"> So you are saying down the road the FED might cancel out the amount of T-Bills and MBS they hold with the Treasury? I'm saying they don't have to, for the US government will never have difficulty servicing its entirely USD-denominated debt. So if you think doing so would confuse/anger foreign nations, fine, don't do it. I *would* however advise that the government stops issuing 10yr bonds in favour of funding itself off no more than say 28 day T-Bills. The reason being is that the latter's basically just creating a whole unneeded industry of speculators providing an entirely unneeded service of ""locking in"" interest rates for the government 10yrs at a time. Waste of time, waste of resources. The goverment shouldn't be subsidising that kind of activity."
