I would say yes. There are a lot of rich assholes in China with too much money to spend. You'll need to market those products not as natural products you'll need to market them as **expensive** natural products. Keeping your product expensive will be the key to success. Those rich assholes aren't interested in cheap stuffs. Do not under any circumstances have any made in China products. Everything must be made outside of China.
