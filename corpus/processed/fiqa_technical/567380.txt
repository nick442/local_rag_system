"Yeah, pretty much. That's really par for the course among underemployed twenty-somethings in New York. To be fair, I've also lived in cost-inflated areas my whole life, so I'm used to it, and know how to work around it. Even so, with that 18k I'm able to support a decent single malt scotch habit. The only thing I may have fudged a little is that I do a some freelance photography on the side, and I use money from that to buy myself a new pair of red wing boots and some nice raw denim jeans every year or so. Which I guess would make my income more like an even $20,000. Sure, I wish I made more so I could have some savings and a little security, and I'm certainly not saying I want to live like this when I'm 35. But I do alright. Point is, people forget that this city is full of poor people, and it wouldn't exist if they couldn't survive doing menial jobs for minimum wage. My neighborhood is full of peurto rican single parents, flipping burgers for less than I make an hour, pulling down maybe thirty grand a year. To a lot of people I know, a $60,000 year would be a fortune. There's a huge difference between ""doing alright"" and this privileged idea of ""getting by"" most people raised in the upper middle class cling to."
