"It's not hard, but it requires effort, and understanding what one is looking at. The social networks aimed at geeks failed or are not exposed to failure (Google+ would be the poster boy) so I assume this network would appeal at general users. The assumption that the general user 1. detects what's happening 2. understands "" "" 3. cares about "" "" doesn't hold water. The pool of users with the three characteristics is small, and their attention span is also limited because it's not their own work and they want to be users."
