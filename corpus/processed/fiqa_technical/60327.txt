Wobbly legs in boxing means he about hit the mat. In MMA, it looks more gruesome because of all the blood, but in boxing, by time someone is to the point McGregor was, he was getting brain damaged. He 'gassed out' starting at the beginning of round 4. His arms were noodles in round 5. Unless you wanted McGregor to risk being stupid, punishment needed to stop when it did.
