Remember when you got bodied for pretending you understood more about linguistics than you did? Because you maybe skimmed a wikipedia page on Chomsky and thought the criticism there meant people didn't respect him as a linguist? And published authors in the field took you to task for an hour? If you don't, maybe you should. It feels relevant.
