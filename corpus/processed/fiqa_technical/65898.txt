Global warming is not a hoax. However this type of climate change, higher CO2, has many benefits and one is that we will have much more vegetation and higher levels of oxygen. All vegetation does better in high CO2 levels as we both know because we are scientific about things and not emotional. Global warming is used as a tax issue. Obama just wants to tax the energy industries, but who always pays is the end user.
