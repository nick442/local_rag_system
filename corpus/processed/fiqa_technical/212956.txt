Yes this! Unions are what ruined the German economy and put them at the bottom of the list of world manufacturers. They are bleeding so many jobs to China and south east Asia experts are predicting they won't have any manufacturing sector jobs left within the year. This is going to exacerbate Germany's already sky high unemployment rate and god knows how they are going to pay off their enormous national debt. On another point I just don't understand how we allow police and fire unions as they don't make those jobs any safer and just end up costing the tax payers more money. If it weren't for them we could pay our police and fire fighters minimum wages. That would equate to about a hundred dollars in tax savings for each and every property owner in a municipality. Furthermore the rights of the workers are best represented by their employers and not an expensive, corrupt union. You can clearly see the efficiency with which large employers like Flour Daniels takes care of their non-union employees. Sure the non-union people have a much higher medical debt load, less home ownership and more frequent bankruptcies due to unpaid medical debt but that is not without its advantages.
