"They aren't necessarily trustworthy. Many institutions claim to have a ""Chinese Wall"" between their investment banking arms and analysis arms. In practice, these walls have sometimes turned out to be entirely imaginary. That is, analysis is published with an eye to what is good for their investment banking business. One of the most notorious cases of this was Henry Blodget, an analyst with Merrill Lynch during the dot-com bubble. Blodget became a star analyst after he correctly predicted Amazon would hit $400/share within a year. However some of his later public analysis dramatically conflicted with his private comments. Famously when he started covering GoTo.com, rating it as ""neutral to buy"", he was asked ""What's so interesting about Goto except banking fees??"" Blodget replied, ""nothin"". Eventually he was permanently banned from the securities industry."
