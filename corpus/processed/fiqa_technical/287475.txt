That's the message from the rich to their audience at Fox News. That's the message to the poor in the Red States. *We wealthy people would love to help you good people, give you things that will get you out of poverty, but there is a problem. You know those lazy people down the street from where you live? If we help you, we'll have to help them, and they will take all the money and waste it, and they will keep taking it until all our wealth is gone. Then there will be nothing for anyone.*
