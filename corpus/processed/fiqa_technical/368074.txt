">If we could provide medicine, food, clothing, shelter, and internet access to every person in the country, then it hardly matters how callous and Randian the employment market is. We can already provide medicine, food, clothing, shelter and internet access to every person in the country, for your implied price of more-or-less free. Our GDP per capita versus our prices is high enough that a basic income program and a universal health-care program could pretty much *solve* the fundamental economic problems of life (in the ""how do I not die on the street?"" sense). Capitalism in the Randian sense *is what stops us from doing so*."
