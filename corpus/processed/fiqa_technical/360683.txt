"Just gonna go out and say right now that I'm running uBlock Origin, PrivacyBadger, and Noscript, and either one of them or some combo of them has resulted in me not seeing an ad for fuck-all in pretty much forever. The only time I see ads on anything are when I have to play ""guess what to unblock"" and make a mistake. Frankly, there's pretty much jack shit out there that can hold my interest well enough to make me do that anymore. Point being, it's far from impossible that OriginalSimba isn't seeing ads."
