Annual inflation was 15%+ in 1979, call it what you want, I call that hyper inflation. And the CPI might say 1% since 2000 but the cost of gasoline and energy, the lifeblood of the economy, is left out in their calculation since ~1992. Inflation right now is 10% if you calculate it the same way we did before 1980.
