This is not good advice, it's all buzzwords with no substance. Obsession can help but can be just as much of a hindrance when it has to be perfect rather than profitable. No exit strategy is a great way to lose your house. It's great having employees who love working for you but if they're not competent workers, they're not going to be productive. Et cetera. The only advice you should take here is to not hire a PR firm since it's easy to see what PR firms would do and copy the parts you think will work for you (basically: setup a functional website and some social media accounts)
