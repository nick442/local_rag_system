If you truly believe your idea is viable, I'd reccommend against going to kickstarter for funding. There are people who make a living by beating kickstarters to market (see the article I linked below). Think about it; you'll have to wait 30 days, employ a developer, then wait for your app to be developed. If you launch on kickstarter, more talented and organized competition will start making competitors once your project gains traction. I'm not entirely sure that a software patent can protect you from this. If you believe in your idea and can adequately explain your vision I'd suggest you pitch it to investors or people you know who may be willing to invest and develop it away from the public eye. Apps don't really have a great track record on kickstarter anyways, and you do need a working orototype IIRC
