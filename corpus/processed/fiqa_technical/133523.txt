Nissan warranties their battery for 100K / 8 years, so it will be interesting to see how they handle a possible problem. As electric cars become more widespread it will also be interesting to see if the second-life market for batteries for static storage comes to pass, a big rebate for your old battery with limited range, but still lots of storage could take out a good chunk of the cost for new batteries.
