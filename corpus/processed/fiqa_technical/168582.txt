"I'm not saying necessarily arguing with the idea that chasing prestige is a mistake, but the way that this is argued within this article is fundamentally flawed. The author even says ""Fuck prestige, get money"" at the end - this is entirely the 'wrong' mindset. One of the worst things you can do in your career is chase dollars early on without considering what you actually want to spend your life doing. Many savvy people would work at McKinsey for free if they could include it in their resume - these are the kinds of jobs that set you up with skills and opportunity for a long, long time. At any rate, prestige early on will open a lot of doors later in your career. Even if your dreams are entrepreneurial, you'll go from being ""a guy starting a company"" to a ""an ex Goldman Sachs executive launching exciting new startup"". A career is a marathon, not a sprint."
