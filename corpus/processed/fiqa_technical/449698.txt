"Whenever I'm looking at whether I can afford a new fixed monthly cost I go over my account statement for the last three months (or last three ""normal"" months in the event that there has been something unusual recently) and list the items into four columns on an Excel sheet - Fixed Essentials - costs that happen every month and that have to happen, stuff like rent, utility bills, insurance, any loans or credit cards etc Fixed Niceties - costs that happen every month but that I could cut if I needed to, stuff like Netflix, Spotify etc Variable Essentials - costs that I incur on an adhoc basis but are essential, I'm talking things like food, fuel etc Variable Niceties - costs that I incur on an adhoc basis but could be cut if required, things like buying DVDs or games etc I sum up the ""Essentials"" columns and divide by three to get a rough monthly average. This is what I have to spend so I subtract this from my monthly income which tells me what I really have available to ""spend"" in any given month. Performing the same ""sum and divide by three"" operation on the niceties and subtracting that from my ""available to spend"" figure tells me what I have left on in an average month - if this is greater than the new monthly cost I'm considering (allowing for some reasonable buffer as well - you don't want to be running to zero each month!) then I can afford the new cost and then I just have to weigh up whether I think it's worth it or whether I'd rather use that for something else. If it's not sufficient and I really want/need whatever the new cost is then I can start looking at the fixed and variable niceties to see if I can make savings there. If after trimming the niceties where I can I still can't afford it but still really want/need it then I'll start looking at the Essentials to see if there are ways to reduce them through switching utility supplier or changing my shopping/eating habits etc."
