"This question is really general to answer. That's like asking ""Is it easier to be a dog or a cat?"" Your answer is going to be defined by your circumstances and approach, which are going to come somewhere from the following: - How much capital do you have to start stuff? - Can you get a loan? If so, how much is it? - Do you already have a business model? Is it going to effectively compete against existing, successful businesses? - Do you have a unique advertising gimmick? - Is this a technical business? Does it require a patent? Is that patent already secured? - Do you already have a new idea or technology? - Where will you find talent? - Do you have any experience with investment? How aggressive are you going to be investing? - Do you have any experience with business? Just remember, the overwhelming majority of businesses fail. I know several business owners (some successful, some unsuccessful). The list goes on, and honestly I don't think Reddit is a good place to start."
