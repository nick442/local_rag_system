No, in fact you didn't really say anything, your initial comment just niggled on the fact he used the total bond market number instead of the muni bond market number from 2007-2008. And were dead stilent on anything else about the article which would lead one to believe that that was all you saw fit to comment on. Which is the equivalent to reading a story of a bank robbery and getting hung up on the article reporting the total dollar amount in the bank instead of the total dollar amount in the cash drawers that were robbed from and not talking about anything else. Also your initial complaint about what numbers he uses for the bond market isn't a lie. You personally feel that he should only mention the 2007-2008 bond market but if you actually read how he used it he wasn't saying anything other than that is the size of the bond market. IN the context it's used in the story there's nothing wrong with the number. He didn't say they were scamming everything in the market it was a one off sentence about the size of the total bond market (that, in fact, is vulnerable to the exact same type of illegal activity he talked about).
