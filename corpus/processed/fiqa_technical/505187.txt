Thank you for taking the time to type up what everyone else (rational people) is thinking. I love your analogy with the faith healers too. Nowa day workers seem more like they are suppose to be cult members who do back breaking labor (long hour, low/no pay) so their leader can ride around in a limousine and wave at them from time to time.
