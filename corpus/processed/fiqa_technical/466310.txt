>The US government debt is how much USD the government has paid the US non-government in excess of what it's taxed them. Correct? Incorrect. The US debt/savings is the balance of credit the US government maintains with US banks, and foreign sovereigns/banks. Why do you need to say it another way? WTF is 'non-government' savings? Other than an academically retarded way of saying 'debt' of course? Its not a bad thing.. unless interest rates rise. But this time is different, so that'll never happen. I'm sticking to my initial assessment. Fairyland.
