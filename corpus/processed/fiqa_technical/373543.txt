"A primary author of the study, Jacob Vigdor, is apparently known to be right leaning. Combine that with the contradictory conclusions in the study such as: ""Low wage workers lost out by 4 to 1!"" and ""Employment for those under $19 went up, as well as for businesses with only one location"". Then, add this cherry on top: ""The study did not include large companies with locations outside Seattle"" (wtf?). You've got yourself one shit show of a ""study""."
