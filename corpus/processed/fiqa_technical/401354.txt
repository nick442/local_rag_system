Places can succeed with mediocre food. They just have to price things right and/or have redeeming qualities making up for the meh food. BWW just doesn't have anything to offer. They're shitty to be in and their food is overpriced. So why go there? Improving the quality of their food probably wouldn't even matter that much because bar wings (and other bar food) aren't going to have all that much pull no matter how great they are.
