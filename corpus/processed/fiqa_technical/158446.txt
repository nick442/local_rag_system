>Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly determined there are not enough qualified and willing U.S. workers available to perform temporary nonagricultural labor to satisfy the needs of some American businesses..The H-2B Temporary Nonagricultural Worker program was designed to serve U.S. businesses unable to find a sufficient number of qualified U.S. workers to perform nonagricultural work of a temporary nature. Congress set the annual H-2B cap at 66,000. are these *qualified and willing temporary nonagricultural workers* paid / housed / treated the same as US citizens? or do they belong to a different legal category, with reduced rights and protections? has the DHS always had a mandate to protect businesses? do they also have a mandate to protect workers from suffering irreparable harm? is that a concept?
