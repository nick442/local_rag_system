"> ignoring everything else that was happening around them and assuming that they were the only company/ecosystem that mattered That *can* work if your ideas are good. Apple's designs are often considered innovative, and they have a [closed architecture](http://www.computerhope.com/jargon/c/closedar.htm) product design. Microsoft just does it poorly. Apple doesn't abandon their existing fan base too often (the FCP X conversion was actually quite bad) while Microsoft seems to ignore their previous achievements and designs. They look at what they can change without the connecting pieces for why it should be changed at all. Alienating those customers they ""won"" is their issue. I am somewhat comparing *apples and oranges* here. Apple makes consumer products with very little enterprise support when compared to Microsoft, which is the opposite. To be clear, I don't own any Apple products but do have a few Windows computers. However, I work in technology with both platforms regularly."
