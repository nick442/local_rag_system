"This is a classic case of Sunk Cost Fallacy. The basic idea is this - don't look at how much you've invested, look at what the thing is worth. It sounds like you are no longer able to keep up, so the financial answer is to stop making repairs, etc. The only question is - whose name is on the deed? If your coworker still owns the asset, you can simply back out say, ""the mobile home is yours, any repairs and payments I made are yours too."" Basically, you will be out all of your work and what you put into it, but you're not continuing to dig a hole. Your coworker should consider your investment as a gift, but a gift that is no longer being made. If in taking over the asset he put it in your name, the asset is yours to do with as you please. It sounds like you should dispose of the asset, even if its at a loss. Either way, from a financial perspective, the answer is to cut your losses and be done with it. All of that is, of course, a strictly financial answer. Reading between the lines, it seems like you feel guilty about not being able to honor the commitment you have made. If there is a sentimental attachment to the mobile, I would suggest discussing your situation with the coworker. That's really not a financial consideration, but that doesn't mean its unimportant."
