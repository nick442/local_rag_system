>if I loan you $500 a night every night for 5 days and those loans allow you to earn $100 totally risk free how much have I loaned you? Does it even matter, because the end of result is I essentially gave you $100. A bank lends me $10k to start a business. I eventually make $5 million dollars with my business. How much was my loan? DOESN'T MATTER, THE BANK GAVE ME $5 MILLION.
