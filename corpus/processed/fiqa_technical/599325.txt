There is plenty of research that shows that companies that have a portfolio of brands within the same category have superior financial returns. The reason is that even for dish soap there are different types of people who want different products. One of the more successful brands for P&G over the past decade has been Gain detergent. It is a mega-brand that competes with tide for people who love scent. The brand has been so successful that there are now dish soaps and other products with the Gain name. There are typically performance differences between the brands. For example trade off performance against a certain type of stain for more scent.
