Yes I do. I think it's irresponsible to not pay back your debt. Your response was the definition of millennial entitlement and why so many of you are socialists (think it's moral to steal from someone else). Why is it responsible to take out a huge amount of debt and cross your fingers you get a job with a degree in gender studies? Even if they did get a good major/school - what if they didn't work hard to network or add experience? And even if they did get a job - what if they spent it all at the bar instead of living cheap and paying off the loan? Why do they get a break and I don't for being responsible and living cheap?
