To answer your last question, yes I would strongly suspect that finance would be more lucrative than school counselling. But is that 46k starting?I'm non-US but that sounds pretty good to me. Also, you don't need an MBA to start getting experience in finance. If your degree is from a different discipline you just need some extra way of signalling that you're interested and capable. Even joining your college's Finance club would be a big help.
