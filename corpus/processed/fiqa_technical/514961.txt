"> Another victim of the robber. You are definitely the victim of something.. > You are defending robbery. You likened it to robbery. I did not. Matter of fact, I believe my prior statement was that taxes are patriotic and our duty. I file mine right on time. The tax man doesn't even have to come to my door to ""rob"" me, because I already mailed him a check. You likened it to robbery, yet you bend over and give it up anyways.. Kind of sad really."
