You're not considering the level of abstraction. There are plenty of axioms taken by philosophers in various arguments throughout history that don't conflict with free will. You're right about the accuracy of axioms being important though. If you can disprove an axiom you can disprove the theory, that's why the fewer axioms taken, and the simpler those axioms are, the stronger the resultant argument becomes. We can make certain simple assumptions about human nature, such as that all else being equal, people will chose to take actions that aligns with their wants/needs over ones that do not.
