The medieval economy was market-oriented. It was totally free or only partially, but it was market-oriented. Actually at that time it was not known of the potential that had to release or to plan the economy, reason why the economy of such was ambiguous. A medieval city could mix different market currents: from monopolies (guilds), collectivisms (socialism, corporatism, etc.), to free market. - It has more of social system than a economic system. I would say that feudalism had the same economic system as capitalism, of market or free market. Yes, they are different, but such difference is of social organization and applied ideology. - With socialism and communism happen something similar, they are the same (or very similar) economic system organization, the only difference is the social system involved in each one.
