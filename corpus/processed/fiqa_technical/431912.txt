Why would his prediction be doubted? The guy predicted the housing bubble because he saw middle managers in every place of business being replaced by software. They were unable to find a new similar paying job and thus lost their houses. Now he sees 500,000 full-time job loses and 800,000 part-time job gains in one financial quarter. He sees 200,000 jobs created last month in July with 140,000 of those jobs being low wage service jobs. The guy is not a prophet. He is a realist. You investors who see the economy with rose-colored glasses are riding high on maximized profits as a result of low-wage earning skeleton operation crews. You'll be in for a rude awakening to find fewer customers able to buy the products and services being offered.
