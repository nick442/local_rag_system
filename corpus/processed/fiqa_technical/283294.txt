[The states are splitting it](http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/08/21/new-york-gets-800m-in-bank-of-america-settlement/). Sadly enough, they're using some of the money to get the houses. >The bank has agreed to contribute at least $20 million in cash and property to local governments and nonprofits. Schneidermanâ€™s office said that contribution should allow the state to take over as many as 300 properties that were left vacant by their previous occupants once foreclosure proceedings began.
