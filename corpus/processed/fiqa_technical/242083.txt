What happens when people move away or lose interest? If it's not profitable you'll be depending on people to continue to make payments for upkeep etc. It's not outside the realm of possibility that you could start a swimming club that could sustain itself with membership dues, but most amenities used by clubs near where I am were built and are owned by the municipalities, and the clubs come and go like the seasons.
