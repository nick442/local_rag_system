Other than the capitalist owner/slave wage deal the Libertarians (US political party Austrian-market wingnuts, not social libertarians in general) so zealously defend. Face it, nobody who has a boss is free and no system in which bosses may exist is one to aspire to. This is the core of libertarian philosophy. To declare that libertarian logic doesn't include full freedom in the workplace is to declare that liberty doesn't apply to the worker. If you're a submissive or a dominant, fine, no problem with you as a person. Just keep your fetish to your bedroom, not our workplace nor our neighborhood nor our planet.
