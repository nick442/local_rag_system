"So you are back to saying that the price Walmart charges for each item depends on the income level of the purchaser. That's not fair, so neither are taxes based on the income levels of taxpayers. I don't think road sweepers should be subsidized so they can drive a Rolls Royce car. And I don't think they should be allowed to live in a Rolls Royce location unless they can afford to compensate those they exclude from it. The fact they currently are is outrageous as it causes a shrunken economy and excessive inequalities. Real estate bubbles are caused by not have a LVT. Obviously there could be no ""bubble"" as it would have already been taxed away."
