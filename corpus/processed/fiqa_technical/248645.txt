"Now you're just splitting hairs on definition. The definition of globalism and by extension globalist differs based on source and context. Other possible definitions: ""the attitude or policy of placing the interests of the entire world above those of individual nations."" ""Globalism is a group of ideologies that advocate the concept of globalization. It tends to advocate for such policies as increases in immigration, interventionism and global governance. Economically, globalism varies between free trade and lowering tariffs to Marxist proletarian internationalism. It is typically viewed as opposite of nationalism, and has become increasingly divisive in politics in many developed countries, such as the United States."" ""Political globalization is when governmental action takes place on a global level, where responsibilities, such as the welfare of citizens and economic growth, are acted upon by an international political body."" Globalism in a political discourse is diametrically opposed to nationalism and has very little to do with business owning interest in other nations other than the repercussions vis-a-vis tariffs and taxes."
