BBA major with concentration in accounting, after landing an internship at a well known community bank as a credit analyst summer intern I'm considering shifting my focus to a career in finance/banking. Throwaway account: I like the work I'm doing now, and know it can be very rewarding and competitive, so I'm considering doing this or something similar as a career, if it's feasible. Work consists of Small business loans mostly, companies with mid seven figure revenue on the high end. I mostly do spreads and underwriting. This is all new to me. I'm very familiar with recruiting in accounting and the opportunities available to me there, but finance is new to me as a focus. Any advice on where to start? What jobs would my internship look good applying to, and how could I make the leap to an investment banking/ M&A role in the future? Ancillary info: 4.0, non-focus school, decent personal skills and a heavy focus on volunteering. I've started networking but I'm in my senior year and most of it has been focused on accounting. Looking to focus more on networking over the remainder of the internship. I would appreciate any insight or resource you could point me to, thanks.
