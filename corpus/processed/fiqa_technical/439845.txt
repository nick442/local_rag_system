"I'm not the commenter you replied to, so I didn't bother addressing the rest since it wasn't directed to me. I was merely pointing out that once again you're bringing utilities into the discussion, which is irrelevant because PayPal *is not a utility.* Also, it's laughable that you're trying to compare hospitals being allowed to ""let someone die based on their political views"" to a being denied use of a money transfer/credit card processing service. Try relevant comparisons and maybe you'll get farther with a discussion."
