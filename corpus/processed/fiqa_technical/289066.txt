(1) Not literally every person..this screams that you don't know what you are talking about. There is literally no one on my team that puts it behind their name nor any of my friends from my MBA program. (2) They aren't as I just proved to you in 3 minutes (3) Your advice is complete and utter shit. (4) As I have already articulated: (A) undergrads know shit, those that have zero experience and an MBA know less than shit. (B) Learning advanced concepts without knowing anything about the real world won't help him, he won't be able to apply anything he has learned. (C) He loses any opportunity to reset his career or recruit into a high level position based on some asshole's advice on the internet. (D) He will command a higher wage exiting MBA with work experience instead of likely taking more debt that he needs to. (E) he gets to deal with hiring managers like me that will grill him on why he thought it was a good idea to do his MBA directly after undergrad with no work experience. I might sound like a dick - but I'm not the one handing out shitty advice that highlights how inexperienced you are.
