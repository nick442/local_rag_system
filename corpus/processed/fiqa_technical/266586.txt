These new block chain coins with their smart contracts seem to be heading in that direction but I'd like someone to walk me through how two or more people with varying amounts of contributions to the organization can keep it all organized. One partner contributes money while the other contributes time and assets. How do you determine a value of each persons contribution? Do you convert each persons contributions to shares or coins?
