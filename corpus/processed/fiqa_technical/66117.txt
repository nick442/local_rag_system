Those billionaires are often billionaires because they make it their job to take my hard earned money, which I give them willingly, and make it worth more than inflation in fifty years so that I can retire with dignity, comfort and peace. If you tax the hell out of that then people are either not going to do it, or it will be prohibitively expensive to do so, meaning that the 401(K) system makes less money. Also, wtf did the rich people do to deserve to be punished?
