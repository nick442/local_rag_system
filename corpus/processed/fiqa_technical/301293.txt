"I don't know where you live, but $12 is an awful lot for a burger, fries and soda. I do like Five Guys and eat there three or four times a year, but it is too expensive. I live in the Southwest and there are lots of small family-owned Mexican restaurants here. One of my favorites runs a $5.75 lunch special. Last time I was there, it was carne en su jugo. That's something between a soup and a stew, with chunks of beef, beans and bacon. It is served with fresh tortillas, cilantro, chopped onions, rice, beans, and a basket of chips with salsa. All made right there. It is a more substantial meal and better tasting. At nearly half the price. The local Italian place has a $5 lunch special. You get a salad bar and either a 12"" pizza or a bowl of spaghetti. Again, all from scratch. There is a good sit-down restaurant that is excellent, too . Entrees (with soup or salad and bread) run $11-$25 or so. This is why I think $12 for a burger and fries is too expensive. It doesn't compete with better products. You can feed two people better food for about the same amount, or have lunch at a fine restaurant for the same amount."
