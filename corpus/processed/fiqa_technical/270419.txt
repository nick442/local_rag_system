I don't need to believe Trump to know that it is true. How many missile defense systems does Europe currently operate within Europe? How many European countries have US military bases? Of course, the US isn't doing this out of the kindness of our hearts. We have something to gain from it as well. My overall point was to put into perspective that Europe's strong social safety net is not all the result of European values. It's also a luxury that comes from not having to spend a ton of money on it's own defense.
