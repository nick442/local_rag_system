The only thing I noticed in the article was that he was complaining about the gridlock in DC. It isn't helping that DC is consumed by the Russian scandal and the only major change the GOP is focused seems to be wiping out health care for the poor and middle class in exchange for a tax break for billionaires. Of course that is getting stuck. Plus the Muslim ban and EPA edicts are kind of one pager decisions that break existing laws. They are clearly created by people who don't understand how laws and the government works. The administration were to change laws they don't like rather than just vomit out random administrative orders. Of course those get stuck in the court system. Frankly, I don't want to see the GOP succeed with any of those initiatives as they are only deliberating between bad and terrible changes for the country. When a government is fucked, gridlock is a good thing.
