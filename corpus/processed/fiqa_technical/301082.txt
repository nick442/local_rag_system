Meh. I'm an advertiser, and it pays off brilliantly. One of the businesses relies 100% on Google ads (a hire company) and does well. Others use various forms of advertising (although skewed towards internet, we do print etc as well) to disseminate news and it's the best way we've found. Whatever Tor opinion on online advertising, it works. Otherwise we wouldn't spend so much Â£ on it.
