None of what you said is correct. Wells Fargo makes over half of it's net income from community banking. Investment Banking is tucked inside of the Wholesale division and represents a relatively small piece of that. Wells' auto portfolio is at $58 billion; by no means as large as say the mortgage exposure, but certainly nothing to sneeze at.
