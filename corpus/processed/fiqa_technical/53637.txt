">No, virtually ever item in the CPI is adjusted using hedonics, which by definition can only be used to lower inflation, not adjust it up. Wow. Just wow. Let's analyze this: >virtually ever item in the CPI is adjusted using hedonics How does one apply hedonics to energy? There are so many items in the CPI basket for which this does not even make sense I don't know where to begin with such a blanket statement. [Here is how the BLS computes CPI](http://www.bls.gov/cpi/cpifaq.htm#Question_6). Note the categories, and that they currently track hundreds of goods in each of about 200 categories, totaling tens of thousands of goods. With a little digging you can find the weighting. [Here is the list of what they apply hedonic weights to](http://www.bls.gov/cpi/cpihqaitem.htm). It is a vastly smaller subset of all goods tracked, and the weightings makes them not affect overall CPI much *at all*. All the precise methodologies are listed on the BLS site, and you can track it all down. As stated below, someone has done the analysis (and there is a PDF on the site) and they obtained that incuding hedonic items affects inflation only by 0.005 percent per year. >which by definition can only be used to lower inflation By your definition? The actual definition does not force either direction. In reality it adjusts up and down as clearly shown in BLS reports, which I'll link below. >, not adjust it up. As I'll list below, it in fact does go both ways. Finally, analysis of hedonics seems to indicate it has a miniscule effect on inflation rates, again papers are cited in the link shown below. [Critics often incorrectly assume that BLS only adjusts for quality increases, not for decreases, and that hedonic adjustments have a large downward impact on the CPI. On the contrary, BLS has used hedonic models in the CPI shelter and apparel components for roughly two decades, and on average hedonic adjustments usually increase the rate of change of those indexes. Since 1998, hedonic models have been introduced in several other components, mostly consumer durables such as personal computers and televisions, but these newer areas have a combined weight of only about one percent in the CPI. A recent article by BLS economists estimated that the hedonic models currently used in the CPI outside of the shelter and apparel areas have increased the annual rate of change of the All Items CPI, but by only about 0.005 percent per year.](http://www.bls.gov/cpi/cpiqa.htm#Question_4). >inflation represents how the value of the dollar has accrued vs the value of a 20"" TV, which is what the definition of inflation is. No, inflation must measure the price *of the same good* over time. When some goods are no longer available, other goods must be investigated to provide continuity in the comparisons. Otherwise you'll have me comparing the price of a horse to the price of a car since they both provide transportation, yet over time one replaces the other, and direct comparisons on $ alone does not accurately measure what one gets for their money. You cannot compare the cost of different goods purely on price alone and call that inflation. >So, no, I don't think you're correct on this. Well, [since other places that track inflation](http://bpp.mit.edu/) arrive at very similar results using different methodologies, and a vastly larger pool of goods I think that you overstate that the changes did not increase accuracy of inflation measurement. >This is also kind of glossing over the fact that the CPI essentially makes the bold argument that energy and transportation prices never affect inflation. CPI makes no such claim. What do you think caused inflation in the early 1970s when oil prices shot up? [Here is the most recent CPI data release from BLS](http://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm) which quite clearly shows both energy and transportation changes being reflected in the CPI. I think when you make a claim you should at least look up if it matches the actual data. This is tiring trying to find evidence for/against so many dogmatic beliefs."
