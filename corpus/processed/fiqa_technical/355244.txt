There is also a very real cost to having people know each other's salaries. Bitterness, at people who have a higher salary, and at the company paying someone a higher salary (or even the same or lower salary) when you do so much more work with them. I'm guessing the average person overestimates their abilities like you said. This means that no matter how fair your salary scheme, if people know each other's salaries, the majority of people will be bitter and thus less productive.
