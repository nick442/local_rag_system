Not like you are limited to one charge a day or anything. About 240mi on an 80% charge, that is 4hrs at 60mph. You can supercharge back to 80% in 20min, but ill give you an hour, so 5hrs to drain and charge, and lets say 3 cycles a day (15hrs). So 720mi/d and 365d/y and 8yrs = 2million miles. Why is charge relevant?
