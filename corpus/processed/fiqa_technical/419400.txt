When I was a kid, the sets were built, then taken apart, thrown in a big box, and rebuilt 100s of times into 100s of different things. Now they get built once, and sit on a shelf as decorations. IMO lego lost its way when it moved away from a 'bucket of discovery' , toward branded show pieces. Thankfully I still have my 40 year old bucket of lego our kids can still innovate and explore with..that bucket sees far more use than any set we've bought in recent years.
