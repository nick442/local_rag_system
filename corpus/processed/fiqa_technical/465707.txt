The fundamental problem with capitalism is that people assume that what makes money is worth doing, and that making money justifies it. Money, wealth, jobs: these are means, not ends. Capitalist theory washes its hands of motivational concerns, correctly, but the guide to proper motivation, philosophy, must be developed concurrently. It has not. We have a modern economy wielded by barbarians and illiterate peasants, a gun handed to a chimpanzee, and we've shot our foot off for lack of learning proper self control.
