I think what actually happens is that at the very high end, people with high SAT scores don't go into Science or Math, not that they fail to graduate (I am pretty sure there is a positive correlation with graduation and SAT scores). If you look at graduation surveys at Harvard, half of the students go into finance and consulting. Tech has increased in the last few years because of increased salaries and increasing popularity of programmers/engineers in popular culture. Basically, the statistic says nothing about the competence of the student. If you randomly select a Harvard student, you will probably get someone whose specialty will be finance or consulting. Graduation rates at Harvard are higher than the average state or community college. But you are right that this is completely irrelevant anyways because an employer will only look at students who have a degree from the right major(s).
