I think that some of that might have to do with not being confortable with accepting systems of rules that people just make up and accept. In the case of relativity, things are based on observation and governed by logic which shouldn't have any contradictions. To understand the creation/destruction of money, it requires understanding how a set of made up rules were implemented and lead to a state where the rules no longer work or seem to form a contradiction, IMO. I wouldn't say it's harder to understand than relativity, I would just say that understanding it requires seeing that, unlike physics, not everything was played exactly by the rules.
