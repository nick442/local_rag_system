">In October, I am going to owe 12 apple-bushels to ""the economy"", so isn't the 12-Loddar IOU cancelled out? Really, the 12-Loddar IOU is a pre-order. This is the kind of stuff that will make your head spin if you try to make everything fit into analogies. You can't ""cancel out"" the value that has been created or destroyed-- those 12 loddars already bought a deer and a pair of shoes (plus you grew a bushel of apples). That's 36 loddars worth of stuff that exists in the world. (actually, it's a lot more, because you also paid farm-workers and I bought arrows and the shoemaker bought leather and that money has been spent on other things and so on). The economic term for this concept is ""velocity of money"", and it gets into stuff that I didn't really cover above. >(b) If we take your metaphor to the modern age, handwritten IOUs won't work anymore; they have to be central-bank-printed notes; That's not true. Handwritten IOUs are are traded pretty routinely at my friday-night poker game. Moreover, in business it's pretty common to order parts and things on a ""Net 30"" Purchase Order, meaning the buyer will send payment within 30 days of receiving the stuff, and nobody needs permission from Ben Bernanke to do that. You actually do the same any time you buy something on a payment plan or use a ""bill me later"" type option. It's easy to get into a routine of paychecks and bills and lose sight of the fact that everyone is actually *creating value* all the time (well, most people are). Dollars are just the markers that we use."
