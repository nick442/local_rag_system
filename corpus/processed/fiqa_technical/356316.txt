>old investors SS is not an investment. It is a Tax. Learn the difference. Thus you pay for it with the [Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax (FICA)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Insurance_Contributions_Act_tax). It is *not* an investment, you do not have an account with your money, it has *always* been a pay as you go plan, just like medicare, funds for schools, and all the other programs. So you fail again on all counts. >And what part of the constitution says the US government should collect some of my wages and save it for me for later? Since it is a tax, Article I, Section 8, Clause 1 covers it pretty well. And the Supreme Court has held that the two mentions of promoting the general welfare also allow taxation for promoting the general welfare. You might want to learn about what the Constitution actually says and more importantly *how that is interpreted by law* instead of what you think it says. >You do know, some people have opted out of SS? Even the US government will not take the fight to court. The US government wrote the laws that specify exactly who can opt out. Most people *cannot* just opt out because they don't meet the criteria. Again you're wrong.
