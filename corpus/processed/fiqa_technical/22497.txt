Think of GDP growth as a weighted average of all agents in the country that produce goods and services, some grow, some retract, we get an average of ~1.5%. While the S&P 500 is just the weighted average of the 500 largest **public** companies, and while some shrink, most are growing. They are responsible for a portion of GDP growth, but not all. Even the Wilshire 5000, which has every public company listed will show growth larger than GDP because of the nature of the companies listed. Lastly, as time goes to infinity, all companies will grow at the rate of GDP growth, otherwise they'll consume every other company until it is the only one left. Essentially, exchanges only look at a handful of companies and their performance. GDP looks at all companies in the U$.
