It is through a vendor leasing to a provider(99% coverage lol). Our municipality does not allow private entities to attach to the fixtures so that puts me in the cats seat. They will be metering their own electric so that is not a problem. You seem to be pretty knowledgeable, would it benefit me to argue for yearly payments instead of monthly?
