Yeah Best Buy is a complete joke. Electronics are one of the things I usually plan out and buy online anyway (they're generally expensive, so saving 5% can be a lot), so when the one thing I always immediately need breaks - a phone charger - guess who always has none in stock, or hardly any selection? Electronics are generally low margin and Best Buy was basically built on the notion that most consumers are ignorant, particularly about tech, and what fair prices are. A 6' HDMI should not be over $10. A usb cable charger shouldnt be more than $10. Now that everyone can price check instantly on their phone, they're fucked. Good riddance IMO, perhaps it will allow some smaller, local electronics stores to thrive.
