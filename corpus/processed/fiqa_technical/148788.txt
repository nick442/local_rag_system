Think it from the womens perspective: interactions with men are not meant to be fun or thrilling and you're not supposed to enjoy sex. You are giving something to the man, and you should be paid. Having a family means giving up your career at marriage, while getting full control of the guy's paycheck. The interaction between men and women in Japan is the most dysfunctional I know of, forcing career women to stay single and men to abandon interactions with women altogether or only seek out those that are paid to provide a service.
