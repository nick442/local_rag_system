Your film degree isn't going to help you do this at all. You know what will? [Learn HTML5, Cloud Services, and Mobile software development.](http://mobile.eweek.com/c/a/Application-Development/HTML5-Cloud-and-Mobile-Create-Perfect-Storm-for-Major-App-Dev-Shift-235285/). You don't need fancy training or a degree in CS, start with the w3c [HTML5 tutorial](http://www.w3schools.com/html5/default.asp), and then explore from there. Read everything you can about these things, then start building something. Get an app or two you've built deployed to your own phone, re-tool your resume, and then start looking for a job as an entry level software engineer. You'll be a much more attractive hire to some employers than a Java developer with 10 years of experience who has no interest in evolving their own skill set and insists on a super high salary.
