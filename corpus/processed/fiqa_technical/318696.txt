"An Xbox currently sells for $200 but you don't have the money right now to buy it. You think the price of the xbox is going up to $250 next month. Your friend works at BestBuy and says he has a ""raincheck"" that allows you to buy the Xbox for $200 but the raincheck expires next month. He offers to sell you the ""raincheck"" for $5. When you buy his raincheck for $5 you are locking in the right to buy the Xbox for $200. It is like an option because it locks in the purchase price, it has an expiration date, it locks in a purchase price, and it is not mandatory that you redeem it. That's an explanation for a call option in kids terms. For more easy answers to the question what is a call option click now. A put can be answered in a similar way. Suppose you bought the Xbox for $250 and then the price drops back to $200. If you keep your receipt, you have the right to return (sell the Xbox back) for $250 even though the current price is only $200. Bestbuy has a 30 day return policy so your receipt is like a put option in that you can sell the Xbox back for a price higher than the current market price. That's a simple example of a put option in kids terms. For more easy answers to the question what is a put click now."
